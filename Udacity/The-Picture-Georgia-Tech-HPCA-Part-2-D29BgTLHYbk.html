tomasulo's algorithm works let's kind of
see an overview picture of what's going
on in there just like what the hardware
structurally looks like so first there
is an instruction queue which I labeled
here IQ instructions come from the fetch
unit in the order in which they were
fetched and again these are only
floating point instruction and then
they're queued up here so this is
basically this is the kind of all this
instruction the next one the next one
the next one and we will be kind of you
know dropping these instructions into
the tomasulo's algorithm machine in the
order in which they came we always grab
the next available instruction from the
instruction queue and we want to put it
into a reservation station there are a
number of reservation stations that
basically when one becomes available we
will put an instruction into one of
those and reservation stations are where
instructions basically set for their
parameters to become ready there is a
floating point register file so this is
where your floating point registers are
and when an instruction is inserted into
a reservation station the values that
are already in registers meaning the
values that are actually already present
and ready for execution are gonna be
simply entered into the reservation
station from the register file once an
instruction is actually ready to execute
it goes to an execution unit and you can
have different types of execution units
so for example this is a rather and this
is a multiplier so simple floating-point
instructions would be done in the kind
of add array unit and more complicated
like multiply and divide would be done
in the multiplier unit each of these
units really had separate reservation
stations where instructions that are
going to that unit would wait once such
a unit has produced a result the result
would be broadcast on a bus so of course
the result would go to the register file
so pretty much all the results that are
read it would be available in the
register file so that instructions that
come in would simply grab them from
there and we know don't have to worry
about where those values are going to
come from but these results would also
be broadcast to the reservation stations
why well because there are instructions
here that are waiting for values that
they need to be produced and as values
are produced we need to tell these
instructions that you know now your
value has been produced so they need to
also go here so pretty much here you
have some values that you already have
an instruction some values that you're
waiting for and you know what you're
waiting for and then when the value is
finally broadcast you check for each of
the value that its broadcast whether
this is the one we are waiting for or
not now I have two of these per
reservation station because a typical
instruction will actually have two
inputs like for example you're adding
two numbers and when you broadcast the
result either of the two or both of them
might need that result so for example if
you're doing something like add r1 r1
and the instructions is producing r1 is
currently in the multiply when it
broadcasts the result and says this is
r1 we want to latch it into maybe both
of the operands for this instruction so
you need to compare basically what's
being broadcast it's name needs to be
compared to both of the inputs that you
are waiting for and then you select the
one or both of them or none of them if
this is not the value you're waiting for
and finally if the instruction is not an
arithmetic instruction if it's actually
a load into the floating point register
file or a store from it then the
instruction would go to the address
generation unit that's an integer
operation so it's not going gonna go
through that so basically we just
compute the address and then we insert
the instruction into the load buffer or
a store buffer where the instructions
are going to be queued up for going to
memory and the load buffer only provides
the data address the store buffer
provides both the address and the data
to memory when a load comes back from
memory its value is also broadcast on
the CD B and goes to the appropriate
register and also all the values that
are broadcast from the bus are going to
go here so that stores can get their
values when they become available so a
store instruction that needs to put a
value in memory is going to wait for its
floating point value that needs to be
placed to memory until it becomes
available and only then be sent to the
memory unlike arithmetic instructions
which can execute out of order basically
they only wait for inputs to become
available and then they can go for loads
and stores they were done in order so
basically they didn't reorders owns and
stores and it will later consider how to
do that modern processors will actually
reorder loads and stores too so this is
a lot simpler than in modern processors
but this here is pretty much the way
it's done now
modulo some small adjustments so before
we go into kind of the details of the
Mosuo algorithm let's just kind of give
names to some things on this picture and
then we will kind of discuss what each
of these things really needs to do so
this part here where we send the
instruction from the instruction queue
into the reservation stations and also
unit is called issue when the
instruction is finally sent to execution
from a reservation station is called
dispatch and when the instruction is
ready to broadcast its result we call
that right resolved or simply broadcast
so basically every instruction will be
issued meaning get to the dressing
station eventually it gets to dispatch
because all of its inputs are at the end
it's kind of gets to go to the unit once
it's done it's going to write the result
and that is when we consider the
instruction completed so now let's see
what happens when you issue when you
dispatch and when you write resolved</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
