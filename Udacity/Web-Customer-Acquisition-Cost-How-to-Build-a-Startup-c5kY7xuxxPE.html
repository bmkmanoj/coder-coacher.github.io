and I'm paying 50 cents for
pay-per-click let's assume my campaign
at 50 cents each gets me 10,000 people
to come look at my website well 50 cents
times 10,000 that cost me $5,000 but the
goal isn't to just have people visit the
goal is to get them to the end of the
funnel and at the end of the funnel I
want them to actually have paid for and
or use the product so the goal is to
activate them now what's interesting is
assume I'm offering a trial and assume
that maybe just 5% of the people who
I've acquired actually now take the
trial and so I now have 500 people using
my freemium product but the goal is not
to just have them use a freemium product
the goal is to actually have them pay
for it and what's interesting is assume
10% of those now actually pay so I'd
start with 10,000 people who came to my
site I spent $5,000 for them 500 people
took a trial of the product and 50 only
50 actually paid for the full version of
the product so while 10,000 people look
great for 5 grand because only cost me
50 cents per person if we now do the
math we can now see it cost me $100 to
acquire one paying customer that $100
equals my customer acquisition cost I
use this example for a web mobile
channel but it's similar for physical
Channel you might not be doing
pay-per-click you might be doing direct
mail math or you might be doing
television or radio math but the math
works the same how much did it cost to
acquire a customer how much did the
campaign cost how much did it cost to
get them to consider your product how
much did it cost them to take a test
drive of your car or fly your airline
and what in the end was your customer
acquisition cost that's a key number for
any founder thinking of
not start up</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
