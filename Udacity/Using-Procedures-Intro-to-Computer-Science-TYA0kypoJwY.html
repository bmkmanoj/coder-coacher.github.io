to be all smiley sebastian tells me is
going to be a few years before i can get
my own self-driving car but the bigger
problem is we haven't yet talked about
how to actually use a procedure all
we've done is make them until we can
actually use them we don't have a good
reason to be really happy yet but we're
gonna learn how to use them next and
then we'll be back to being smiling so
now we're going to learn how to use a
procedure the way to use a procedure we
need the name of the procedure followed
by a left paren followed by a list of
inputs and there could be any number of
inputs but it has to match the number of
inputs the procedure expects these
inputs are sometimes called operands
they're sometimes called arguments but
we're not going to argue about that
we're just gonna call them inputs so
you've actually already done something
quite similar to this back in unit 1 you
learned about using find on strings and
with find you would pass in one or two
inputs the first input was a string that
was the string that you're looking for
that's the first input and the second
input could be a number the position
where you start looking for that string
and so we use find in many ways in unit
one as well as you used it yourself in
the homework for unit one find is a
little different from the procedures
that you define yourself first of all
it's built in the other thing that was
different is that instead of just having
find we had another input that was
really over here right we had the string
that we're doing the find in let's say
it was in the variable page that's
really another input to find we'll talk
in a later class about why that's done
differently but it's very similar to
calling a procedure where one of the
inputs is over here the other two are
here it's a little different from that
and we won't get into that in this
course but in a later course you'll
learn more about what this really means
for all the procedures that you define
yourself we won't have any object to
invoke them on we'll just have the
procedure to call and the arguments or
operands or inputs as you like to call
them to passing so let's see how that
works with a simple procedure I'm going
to define the procedure rest of string
and we'll give it the parameter s so
that means it takes one input and we're
going to use the name s
to refer to the value of that input and
we'll make it return the string from the
first character to the end so we'll use
the string annexing operator return s 1
: this will evaluate to the string with
the first letter removed so all strings
from the position 1 until the end of the
string and that's what we return so
that's the output of rest of string is
that new string that starts from the
second letter in the input string here's
an example of how to use this procedure
so we could call it directly so we could
say print rest of string so that's our
procedure now we're gonna have our paren
and we're gonna pass in an input there's
one parameter to rest of string so we
need one input pet to pass in and it
should be a string so we'll pass in the
string audacity what happens when we
call a procedure like this execution
will jump into the body of the procedure
so we can think of what the interpreter
is doing is now instead of running the
code here the interpreter will move when
we call a procedure it will jump to run
the code inside the procedure it will
assign to the parameters the values
passed in as the inputs so we can think
of this as there being an assignment
that says now the value of s is the
value of this input that was passed in
and now we're going to evaluate the body
of the procedure in this case there's
only one statement it's this return
statement we're gonna find this value so
s index 1 colon the result of that is
going to be the string Udacity and then
we got to the return what return means
is we're going to jump back we're
jumping back to where we called the
procedure but now we actually have a
result so when we jump back the value
that this evaluates to is whatever value
we returned in this case it's the string
Udacity so we don't have our
self-driving car but now you can define
and use procedures this is a really
powerful concept anything that we're
gonna do in the rest of the course and
anything almost anyone does in
programming computers is all about
defining procedures and using procedures
so now we should have a big smile we can
think of our procedures in terms of
mapping inputs to outputs we can think
of
our humans is also mapping inputs to
outputs we have inputs coming through
the eyes through the mouth maybe we even
have a nose and I won't try to draw any
of the outputs of our human procedure
but since procedures are such an
important concept we're going to have
several quizzes now to check that you
understand them well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
