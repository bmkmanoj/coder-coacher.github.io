wanna mention is product related
mistakes a typical example of product
related mistake is gold plating of
requirements and what that means is
basically is that it's very common for
projects to have more requirements and
they actually need for example marketing
might want to add more features than the
ones that are actually needed by the
users and of course having more
requirements lengthens the project
schedule in a totally unnecessary way
feature creep is another common mistake
and consists in adding more and more
features to a product that were not
initially planned and are not really
needed in most cases and here there is
evidence that the average project
experiences about a 25% growth in the
number of features over its lifetime
which can clearly highly affect the
project schedule finally if you're
working on a project the strains the
limits of computer science for example
because you need to develop new
algorithms for the project or you have
to use new techniques then that project
might be more research than actual
development and therefore it should be
managed accordingly for example by
taking into account that it will have a
highly unpredictable scale you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
