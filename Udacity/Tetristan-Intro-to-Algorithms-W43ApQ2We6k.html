answer is 3 tada all right now I will
show you how I did it I will not leave
you in suspense for very long so all
right so see if we can work out what's
going on here this region here this
county is going to have to get some
color and it's ultimately not really
going to matter which one it is so I'm
just going to call it that G is going to
have to code that's different from H so
we'll call it that now we notice that
this region touches both of these two
regions so it has to have a different
color than both of them this region
touches both green and blue but not pink
so it has to be pink and D touches both
pink and blue so it has to be green and
now we've got these three regions and
what do we know about these three
regions well these two can't be green
and they have to be different from each
other so one of them is pink in one of
them's blue and that means this one's
going to have to be green but we don't
know about these two so here's what I'm
going to do I'll mark them as sort of
both pink and blue like the this going
diagonal lines our distance pink this
one's blue and this going diagonal lines
this one pink of this one blue
regardless it's going to turn out not to
matter so now we're going to have to
assign numbers to green pink and blue 0
1 and 2 but notice that we have G minus
a here at G minus a well no matter what
numbers you assign they're going to be
the same color so this has value of zero
doesn't matter what color C is C times
zero is going to end up being zero so
what we're left with is d plus f plus h
so d plus f + h now notice that they're
each of them are different colors so no
matter what numbers you assign to those
three colors we're going to have exactly
one of each the colors get assigned
number 0 1 and 2 so the sum is going to
have to be three so that's the trick</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
