of all the terms in the sum here you
need to take the one with the fastest
growth rate so log in is piddly as n
gets big compared to n and n is actually
pretty piddly as n gets big compared to
N squared N squared is really only thing
that matters here this constant in front
of the N squared is not going to matter
in big theta world because we can go
above it or below it any coefficient
here gives you the same answer so these
terms drop out this leading term doesn't
really matter so really this is N
squared
however in big data world this is also N
squared so everything every function is
big data of itself it's very easy to
sandwich it between 1.5 times the
function and 0.8 times the function by
the definition a big theta this is true
this is not true this is true because 20
n squared is also big data of N squared
and this is not once you multiply
another term in here even though it
grows really slowly it's not a constant
it changes the asymptotic growth rate
this is big data of those three</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
