controller to our app adding another
screen and view controller to manage
that screen is just what we need to turn
pitch-perfect into the app we want open
the library panel here on the bottom
right if you don't see the library panel
make sure you have the object's library
button selected it's a third one from
the left here drag a view controller
onto the storyboard like this you may
want to position it as I have here to
the right of the records view controller
let's make it clear we're going to the
new screen we can use our old trick of
changing the background color of the new
view controllers view so that it's
something other than white here I've
selected the view controller and it's
view you can see storyboard has
automatically zoomed in to the second
view controller with its view selected
I'm going to change the background color
to something other than white in my case
green set it to whichever color you
prefer just so that it's something other
than white now we need to make
storyboard transition from our recording
view controller which is just called
view controller to our new view
controller for now what I want is to
connect it to the stop recording button
first select the stop recording button
here in the document outline then you
can hold down the control key and drag
directly from it to the new view
controller select the show segue you
should see the new symbol with the arrow
connecting the two view controllers seen
here this is called a segue remember we
previously wired up the stop recording
button to the stop recording function
via an IB action
it means the stop recording button is
doing two things it will call the code
in our recording view controller and
that will also cause the segue to occur
moving us to the next view controller
now you may be thinking yourself wait a
minute where is the code for that green
view controller we never created any
class you're correct
storyboard is using the default UI view
controller not a subclass that you wrote
and it's just a plain UI view of which
we changed the background color let's
run this app and see if we click tap to
record and then stop the recording we
can see that the UI navigation
controller has transitioned this to the
second view controller that's green take
a moment to notice the new bar
call a navigation bar and the back
button labeled back this is a pre-built
back button that will return us to the
previous view controller a sort of
breadcrumb if you will we have just
scratched the surface of UI navigation
controller because that is all we need
for now in order to build out the
pitch-perfect app in UI kit fundamentals
you're going to learn about UI
navigation controller in much further
detail</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
