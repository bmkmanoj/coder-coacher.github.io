endemic to regions like Kenya and in
Africa so it's higher in the region
because it provides resistance some
resistance to malaria
I see so malaria is a common sickness
yes definitely early I've had malaria
everyone else in my family has had
malaria it is really what's it like to
have malaria
um you malaria is like the flu I've
never had the flu but from what people
describe the flu as you get dizzy you
get nauseous
you get achy joints when I had malaria I
remember being very dizzy dizzy enough
that the floor seemed very far away and
like it was teetering and you're just
kind of out to me you get a fever
the usual and how does the I mean how
does the malaria spread malaria is
spread through mosquitoes mosquitoes and
so the best way to combat that then is
just like bug spray or bug nets or
something so the best way would be you
don't want to have pools of water
stagnant water outside your home because
they're attracted to that so if you had
a drum of water just sitting outside
your window you can get a bunch of
mosquitoes just hanging out waiting for
a nighttime or whenever you also want to
have a mesh screens on your windows and
doors so that when you do need to open
your windows bugs can't get in and then
another way if you can't do all of that
is you need to have mosquito nets over
your beds at night because that's the
time when they're likely to strike when
you're just kind of lying there and
still wow so you're pretty sure most
people are sure then that if they get
malaria it's because you know mosquito
bit them at some point probably yes and
um so it's pretty common you've had it
you said everyone in your family is out
of it right have you do people get it
multiple times
yes see is there treatment for it there
is treatment for malaria you go to the
hospital or clinic or your doctor and
you get
medication I'm not sure what it was
exactly I think we take it for granted
because it's so common you just go and
they prescribe you something and you get
better how long does it take to get
better
I know people who will go back to work
or to school after three days and then I
know people who'll stay home sick for a
few weeks it just depends on the person
and how early you caught it as well I
tend to catch mine early because my
stomach hurts and then for me that's the
main symptom and then I can't ignore
that
whereas with others if they're just
feeling a little under the weather
they'll think to themselves I'm just a
little tired I'll go home
so you mentioned that the reason sickle
cell anemia is higher in Kenya is
because it provides some resistance to
malaria but if you have one allele for
the sickle cell how exactly does it
provide resistance so I think what it is
when you have sickle cell anemia is that
your red blood cells are crescent shape
and this makes it makes them resistant
to infection from the parasite I see so
it's sort of a trade-off then I mean
sickle cell anemia doesn't sound like a
good thing but neither is malaria and
true so if it provides some advantage
then that's probably why it's more
prevalent in the region yeah I think
that's true but then isn't there's
something about sickle cell anemia where
you don't live past a certain where more
people with sickle cell anemia will not
live past a certain age and so in that
way with malaria you can get treatment
and live to be 80 and then the sickle
cell anemia yep you're more likely to
have a shorter life span that's a really
good point so the while if you have
sickle cell anemia you have to have two
copies of the allele to have sickle cell
if you're just a carrier you have one
copy which provides resistance against
malaria 2 but you don't have any of
these symptoms of anemia but you raise a
really interesting point though that
actually our treatment of malaria means
that you don't there's no natural
selection happening as much or there's
not as much happening because we don't
you don't need the sickle cell allele to
protect you from malaria as much because
now we have drug trace you're not
to die from malaria as frequently when
we have drugs and now that means that
okay the sickle cell allele actually
isn't being naturally selected for
anymore so although we have drugs to
treat malaria and help you get better
sickle cell anemia the allele still
exists but actually it's not being
selected for anymore but um it's so
prevalent in the region but as you move
away from regions that are stricken with
malaria you don't see the sickle cell
allele at all if you could give advice
to somebody who either is going to a
region with malaria or you know grown up
in a region has just gotten malaria for
the first time you have any advice of
what to do when you get malaria well
first of all for someone going to an
area that has malaria I would say you
need to go get your anti malaria tell us
you want to go you want to be prepared
because you probably don't have
resistance to the parasite yet and so
it's important to go to a travel clinic
or wherever and get something and to
malaria pills for someone who's having
it before the first time see a doctor
don't take chances don't let it stay too
long because it can kill you and that's
pretty much it don't freak out there's
treatment</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
