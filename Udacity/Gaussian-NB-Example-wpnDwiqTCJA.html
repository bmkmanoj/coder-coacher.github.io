to the Gaussian naive Bayes
documentation page SK learn naive Bayes
dot Gaussian naive Bayes this was the
algorithm that I set out to find and now
that I've now I've found the SK learn
documentation page so the first thing
that I see right here actually this is
one of the things I love about the SK
learn documentation is it's full of
examples when I was actually developing
the code for this class this was one of
the first things that I would always do
is I would come find the example code
and I would try to just run it in my
Python interpreter to see if I could get
it working and almost invariably it
works right out of the box so here's
something that's just very simple
there's only a few lines here that are
really important so let me point them
out to you and then I'll show you the
code that I've actually written for the
example that we just saw and you'll
start to recognize some of these lines
but first let's introduce them so the
first one that's really important is
this one right here above this it's just
creating some some training points that
we can use that's not that important
this is where the real meat starts is
with this import statement and if you
programmed in Python before you're
well-acquainted with import statements
this is the way that you bring in
external modules into the code that
you're writing so that you don't have to
completely reimplementation learn
naivebayes
i'm going to import gaussian n be very
good the next thing that we're going to
do is we're going to use that to create
a classifier so classifier equals
Gaussian NB if you miss your import
statement if you forget this line for
some reason then this line is going to
throw an error so if you end up seeing
some kind of error that says that it
doesn't recognize this function it's
probably a problem with your import
statement so okay we've created our
classifier so now the code is all sort
of ready to go the next thing that we
need to do is we need to fit it and
we've been using the word train
interchangeably with fit so this is
where we actually give it the training
data and it learns the patterns so we
have the classifier that we've just
created we're calling the fit function
on it and then the two arguments that we
pass to fit our X which in this case are
the features and Y which are the labels
and this is always going to be true in
supervised classification
that it's going to call this fit
function and then it's going to have the
features and then the labels and then
the last thing that we do is we ask the
classifier that we've just trained for
some predictions so we give it a new
point in this case the point is negative
0.8 negative 1 and we ask for this what
do you think the label is for this
particular point what's the which class
does it belong to so in this particular
case it says it belongs to class number
1 or you can imagine for some other
point it might say class number 2 so of
course you have to have already fit the
classifier before you can call predict
on it because when it's fitting the data
that's worth actually learning the
patterns then here is where it's using
those patterns to make a prediction so
that's it that's kind of now you know
most all there is to know to get this
working in the first example that I've
done</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
