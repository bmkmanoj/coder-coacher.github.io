why it works suppose we have two roller
positions X 0 and X 1 and we know that
10 apart with some Gaussian noise let me
know that the Gaussian noise and
exploitation moves the writable position
10 of the left over position but there
is some uncertainty when we talked about
common filters we talked about gaussians
and this uncertainty might look as
follows there's a constant exponential
in the expression that x1 minus x0
should relax to 10 but might deviate
from it this Gaussian constraint over
here characterizes the constraint
between x1 and x0 and wishes them to be
exactly 10 apart the Gaussian is maximum
with this equation is fulfilled but as a
residual is not equal to 0 there's still
a probability associated with it
let's now model a second motion say X 2
is 5 apart we now get an even bigger
Gaussian relative to the very first one
but the local constraint over here reads
just like the constraint over there so
let me just write it down x2 minus x1
minus v square over Sigma square now the
total probability of this entire thing
over here is the product of these two
things if you want to maximize the
product we can play a number of
interesting tricks first the constant
has no bearing on the maximum just on
the absolute value so we're going to
find the best values for X 0 and X 1 and
so on you can drop the constant secondly
we can drop the exponential if we're
willing to turn the product into an
addition and remember we added things in
Omega and in Sigma that's why and
finally we can actually drop the minus
1/2 turn the dead also plays no role in
the maximization of this expression so
it turns out what you added we're
constraints just like these and you even
added them in a certain strength of 1
over Sigma square in particular if you
really believe that a constraint is true
you should add a larger value in this
matrix over here and on the right side
you should multiply the right constraint
with an even larger value but
differently take an expression like this
and
multiplying the Sigma square you get
something of this nature over here well
1 over Sigma regulates how confident you
are for a small Sigma 1 over Sigma
becomes large so 5 is much rather than 1
that means you have much more confidence
let's go back to the code and modify the
code so the last measurement has a
really high confidence so I want you to
multiply the last measurement between X
2 and your landmark with a factor of 5
in your code hard-coded that is going
somewhere over here where the last
measurement is being applied and do the
trick
let us show you and see what the outcome
is when I do this I get minus 3 2 point
one five point seven one four and six
point eight two one as the answers and
you'll see in this final result the
final roll position of five point seven
one four in the landmark position of six
point eight two one are really close to
one indifference which was the
measurement because you now believe this
measurement over proportionally over
other measurements and motions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
