population or they exist on a spectrum
this is what we would call a normal
distribution or a bell curve look at its
shape it looks like a dome-shaped bell
let's imagine that this is the risk
distribution curve for breast cancer in
a population of women what this means is
that we took a population of women let's
say in the United States or elsewhere
and we tallied each individual's risk
for breast cancer and then after
tallying everything up we put it in this
graph here on the horizontal or the x
axis we have the risk of breast cancer
which is measured as a probability or
percent and the vertical axis or the y
axis here shows how many women have that
particular risk for example in this
particular normal distribution the most
number of women have a breast cancer
risk of about twelve percent you can see
the height of the bell curve is here
about thirty percent of women have a
12-percent risk of breast cancer this
number right in the middle the average
this means that twelve percent of women
develop breast cancer during their
lifetime another way to say this is that
the average woman has about a 12-percent
risk for developing breast cancer this
is how we can turn population data into
a risk assessment for an individual
person as the bell curve indicates most
women's risks will be close to the
average of twelve percent and as you get
farther away from the middle fewer and
fewer will have an average risk the
women down here will have a lower risk
of developing breast cancer and the
women over here will have a higher risk
of developing breast cancer but as you
can see most women fall into the
category near the average risk</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
