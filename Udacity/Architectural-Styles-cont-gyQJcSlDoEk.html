included include the fact that what we
have done by documenting an
architectural style is encode our
experience on it for example with the
client server there are certain ways of
dividing things up and connecting them
together that work better than other
ways we also know with client-server
what kinds of problems can arise and how
we can best cope with those and having
that knowledge then allows us to reduce
our overall development effort because
we're not stumbling down blind alleys
architectural styles can also be encoded
into standards standard sometimes called
reference architectures and those
standards can then support the
validation process the way that we check
whether our architectural solution is a
good one architectural styles can also
support reuse the fact that there are
all kinds of client-server systems out
there means we may be able to make use
of standard components such as my sequel
database server and because different
styles provide different ways of
structuring the development process we
may even even be able to use this the
style to guide us in what our group
should look like and the steps that they
should take when validation could come
and so on what I'd like to do now is
have a look at some of the different
architectural styles that have arisen
over the years</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
