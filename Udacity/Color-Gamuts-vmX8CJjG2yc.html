computational computer vision when we
talk about the color space of devices
actually when we talk about the color
space of devices
well we're usually talking about is
what's referred to as the color gamut
okay and color gamuts are just subsets
of possible colors and here I'm showing
you three different color gamut that
have been measured or that are just
defined in a particular way so you see
this first one alright this is the 1931
that's that chromaticity diagram is
telling you about and the and this big
that's all the colors you can see notice
that on the inside is this triangle that
is tremendous subset of that possible
set and you see it says HDTV turns out
these are all the colors that HDTV can
make so if you wanted to make this
really nice lush deep green HDTV can't
do it because of the way it defines its
color space all right any photographers
out there I hope so
if you use Photoshop or any other
photographic manipulation systems that
understand color spaces they'll tell you
that you can have it in a color space of
srgb or Adobe RGB or prophoto RGB these
are different size color spaces and you
know one of them is really small it's
this srgb okay why do people use that
one so much that's the color space that
most color monitors used to be able to
support okay and so if you are
displaying something say on the web you
don't want to have these colors out here
because they're not going to show up the
right way on a monitor so when you try
to do color balancing sometimes you have
to map colors that are distributed out
throughout all of color space onto a
smaller color space that's particularly
true when you print things here is a
some gamut comparisons of so that again
the the big one is all of human vision
the white one is this Adobe RGB we were
talking about notice the green one the
green one it says Epson 2,200 premium
lustre
that's the color gamut of one particular
printer on one particular paper okay
that's the set of colors that that
printer can make so if you have a color
out here
it won't work very well likewise down
there I learned this the hard way when I
first got into digital photography my
daughter who at the time was about
eleven years old was wearing this really
kind of dark blue shiny royal blue dress
and I printed it on an HP printer not a
great printer but not a terrible printer
and it was purple and what was annoying
to me to begin with is the color of a
bunch of other things were perfect so
why you know because I understood color
balance you know maybe I had a wrong
color no you know might my son's gray
thing was nice and gray it didn't didn't
shift blue or red but her her a blue
thing was looking purple the reason was
is that it was outside the color gamut
of the printer alright and I've
subsequently paid a lot of money to get
a much better program</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
