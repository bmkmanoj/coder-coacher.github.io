is 10 feet wide by 15 feet long that
gives him a total area of 150 feet
squared since areas just length times
width which is 10 x 15 now this whole
slingshot game is taking up a ton of
space in fact he's already way outside
of his boundaries in terms of where the
ball is ending up he's also worried that
if people throw really poorly they
wanted to hit people in other booths
that would definitely not be good
marketing for grants gleaming glasses
the person in charge of the expo told
grant that he can in fact expand the
space that he's in under one condition
he has to increase his dimensions by the
same amount in both directions if he's
going to make this any bigger for now
I'm going to call that link that we're
going to add on X grant ambitious as
always wants to double the area of his
booth that way he'll have 300 square
feet of space to do whatever he wants
with the question is how much does he
need to increase these dimensions by
what does X need to equal to make this
happen</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
