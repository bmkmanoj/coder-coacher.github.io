app do you want to build for your final
project in this question you're going to
determine in more detail exactly who
you're building this app for and in the
next question you'll actually construct
a high-level flow for this user but
let's stay focused here so the flow for
what you'll do in this question itself
is first you'll find a potential user
this could be a friend coworker family
member somebody who you think could ever
feasibly want to use the app you
described here then you're actually
going to do some very basic user
experience research this will
essentially be an interview with this
person you know where you try and figure
out the attributes about them as they
pertain to the app you want to build now
doing this is really hard user research
is not easy and we've provided a Prezi
template which includes some suggested
questions and categories of questions to
think about once you've done your user
research you'll actually create a
persona and use case for the person you
interviewed again that template is going
to be really helpful for this step some
really key points when you're thinking
about user research first be quiet and
by that I mean the other person should
be doing most of the talking try not to
interrupt and definitely don't ever tell
them they're wrong second is to ask open
questions and by this I mean let's say
you were to make a music app for this
person you shouldn't ask a question like
how much do you enjoy listening to music
in the car rather ask when do you listen
to music</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
