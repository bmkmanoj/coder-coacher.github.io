want to drag it to a new position here's
a demo of dragging in action it's a bit
more involved since you also have to
track and respond to Mouse move and
mouse up events I'm not going to walk
through the code since you can take a
look yourself
the main question with dragging in 3d
space is how to constrain the third
dimension
there are usually two choices one is to
constrain the movement to be parallel to
the screen surface as seen in this demo
the other method is to limit movement of
the object to be on a world plane or
other geometry in the scene for example
if you've dragged a handle on a face of
a box to resize it you limit interaction
to be along the faces normal direction
beyond the various mouse and keyboard
combinations double-click shift and
control keys there are also different
forms of selection in areas as diverse
as realtime strategy games and
computer-aided design programs you can
select a whole set of objects by drawing
a rectangle around them on the screen
this sort of selection is done by
finding which objects are fully or
partially inside what is essentially a
smaller frustum on the screen lasso
selection lets you draw an arbitrary
shape on the screen for choosing a set
of objects
yippie-ki-yay these aren't built into
3GS I just wanted to point out some ways
of doing selection keep in mind that you
don't have to make a selectable object a
visible object for example for
positioning a directional light you
might put an invisible sphere in the
scene and only make it selectable
wherever the user clicks on the sphere
determines a point in space which in
turn determines the direction the light
comes from this is as far as we're going
with selection and interaction the rest
of this unit will be about animation
which is a huge topic</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
