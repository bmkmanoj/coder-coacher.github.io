wins is in the data center a data center
typically consists of many racks of
servers and any particular cluster might
have as many as 20,000 servers assuming
that each one of these servers can run
about 200 virtual machines that's
400,000 virtual machines in a cluster a
significant problem is provisioning or
migrating these virtual machines in
response to varying traffic loads Sdn
solves this problem by programming the
switch state from a central database so
supposing I have two virtual machines
within the data center that need to
communicate with one another the
forwarding state in the switches in the
data center ensures that traffic is
forwarded correctly if we need to
provision additional virtual machines or
migrate a virtual machine from one
server to another in the data center the
state in these switches must be updated
updating the state in this fashion is
much easier to do from a central
controller or a central database
facilitating this type of virtual
machine migration in a data center is
one of the early killer apps of Software
Defined Networking this type of
migration is also made easier by the
fact that these servers are addressed
with layer 2 addressing and the entire
data center looks like a flat layer 2
topology what this means is that a
server can be migrated from one portion
of the data center to another without
requiring the virtual machine to obtain
new addresses all it needs to happen for
forwarding to work is the state of these
switches needs to be updated the task of
updating switch state in this fashion is
very easy to do when the control and
data planes are separate</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
