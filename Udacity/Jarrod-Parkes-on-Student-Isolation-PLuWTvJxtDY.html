course developer at Udacity thank you so
much for talking to us today Jerry
thanks for having me I were to talk a
little bit about student isolation and
especially student isolation as it
arises in online classes I want to talk
to Jared about this because Jared you
have unique experience in three
different ways on this topic one is as
the student of online classes one is as
the designer of online classes and one
is also as a remote employed Jared works
for you dassent in mountain view but
actually works out of his home in
Alabama that's kind of three interesting
takes on the angle of isolation also
start with the class with the experience
as a student in the class so what's your
experience being a student in an online
class where you might not be co-located
with your stew on with you fellow
students so every time that I've taken
an online class I think one of the
things I quickly find myself doing is
wanting to share my experience with
people so whether I'm taking the class
in isolation which is usually the case
when I'm done with whatever the lesson
is that day or the content that I've
consumed very quickly I want to talk
with other people about it so for me
I've always been able luckily to
facilitate that with actual in-person
conversations but I think for others
it's useful to have a place to discuss
topics so this is that a perspective you
trying to incorporate when you're
designing courses is there a way we can
salute Lee I think any and every
opportunity that we have and that
students want to take advantage of that
is discussion based is always beneficial
I mean that really I think helps capture
what is difficult sometimes in the
online education space is that you mean
you don't have the same physical
classroom that's traditionally always
been there where people are having these
types of conversations it's true that
there's a absence of that physical
interaction that face-to-face
interaction we have right here but in
your experience is there any instance
where not only the online in environment
be as good as it might be in person but
can it ever be better I think so i think
what the online environment has allowed
me to do personally and I think maybe
some others as well is that allows me to
put my head down and just go straight
into a topic and not have to weed
through say the conversation sometimes
so it's kind of a mix-and-match approach
and yeah when I want to learn a certain
topic I can go and find it freely and I
that's something that is better
inherently about it yeah I think that
one of my favorite experiences with
isolation and online classroom and the
comparison to an on-campus class is that
on campus if I know there's a student
question coming up I know students are
confused about something in its you know
friday night and i just finished a
lecture on friday afternoon and i'm
aware that students are confused i have
to wait until monday to get back to them
and talk to them about that but what we
have online is what i call
twenty-four/seven classroom it's always
there students are always available than
our accidents are always checking their
email they can always visit forums they
always have a way they can interact with
one another and so I mentioned this
before and these interviews but I can
have an experience where I'll log into
our class forum and in five minutes I
can interact with 10 different students
and then come back an hour later and do
it again and that's something we can't
really do in person in person we have
this time boxing we have limited
resources to meet in person because we
have different classes and things like
that so there's a lot of things that we
could do online that actually can break
that isolation but to your point it's
not something that just happens
automatically it's something mm and it
interesting is kind of like a dichotic
state I think students have moments in
their learning where they really want to
be in conversation and then they have
moments in their learning where they
really don't and I think a lot of times
as you're taking online courses a lot of
that responsibility is being placed on
you as the learner and I think for us is
course designers if we can take some of
that responsibility away and facilitate
the times when you want to learn with
your head down to the grindstone or when
you want to have class discussion yeah I
think it's really nice too because I I
sometimes comment on what i call a rule
20 s which is if anything is effective
or twenty percent of the students in a
class we should use it because twenty
percent is a decent enough portion but
we're never gonna have anything reach
100 percent and that's really nice here
because it means that those twenty
percent to or or more we're going to get
a lot of out of class discussions can do
them but those who really don't get a
lot out of them don't have to sit in the
classroom listening to them right and I
mean I think a lot of students
experience this at an early age for
instance in traditional classrooms where
the conversation is something you
already know a lot of people enter a
grade school at very different levels
and so if you don't skip a grade or you
don't get into the accelerated program
you get bored and that's not good for
students that's a waste of time and I
think that students learn over time that
if I'm not consistently being challenged
that school is boring
and that's definitely not we want them
to learn because eventually school won't
be boring eventually you know they'll
get to the level that they're ready for
but we don't want them to learn that
they can skate through until then right
so um so to come to a little bit out
your experience if you don't mind also
as a a remote employee someone working
at distances their similarity between
being a remote student in a remote
employee I think there are similarities
and the fact that I i feel like i need
discussion as a remote remote employee
whether that's facilitated through
online chat or if i can just talk to a
friend so you know where i work from an
alabama I tried to do my best to create
a space that is kind of the office
that's very separate from what is the
home and then I've also tried to force
myself during the day to go out and have
conversations with people even if it's
just over lunch because if I don't do
that I feel like I've been in a cave all
day and it drives motivation down the
same kind of motivation maybe it is for
learning I feel like it drives my
motivation down for producing good
material and doing good work I think
nowadays we also are have the benefit of
a lot of really nice tools around these
programs that we have our class forums I
know that the OMS CS program uses
HipChat we at Udacity you slack and
there are some really nice tools they
can kind of try and recreate that
environment of being in an office or
being in classroom that I always have
people at my fingertips that I can talk
to or I can always post a message right
now while I'm thinking about it that
people will see when they have time as
opposed to oh I need to remember to
bring that up on monday when i get back
to class yes it's one of those it's like
that strain or it's strange it's like
the old saying you know you don't know
how much you missed something until it's
gone and when you're in the office every
day around tons of people and maybe you
have too many meetings you like gosh I
wish I didn't have to meet all the time
whereas when I'm remote I feel like I
look forward to those meetings because
that's my opportunity to actually get to
talk to somebody during the day yeah
absolutely see any final thoughts for
our students who might be trying to
solve the problem of student isolation
when they're designing their tools I
think it's just to be conscientious of
the things we just talked about and to
recognize that you know maybe when your
motivation is down and you feel isolated
to go out and seek and speak with other
students you never know what you're
going to learn and you know I think
there's a lot of reciprocity between and
happens in student conversations a lot I
mean you're going to get something out
of it and somebody that you're speaking
with its going to get something out of
it okay make sense to me great thank you
so much for talking to us today</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
