summarizing a few important aspects of
white box testing the first important
aspect is that white box testing works
on a formal model the code itself or
modders derived from the code so when we
do white box testing we don't need to
make subjective decision for example on
the level of obstruction of our models
normally we simply represent what's
there and so what we obtain our
objective results in objective measures
as I also said at the beginning coverage
criteria allows us to compare different
tests with different sets of tests
because I can measure the coverage
achieved by one test with and by the
other and then decide which one to use
based on this measure and again remember
these measures are not perfect but they
at least give you an objective number
and objective measure of the likely
effectiveness of your tests so even
though achieving 100% coverage does not
mean that you identified all the
problems in the code for sure if your
level of courage is 10% for example for
statement coverage that means that you
haven't exercised 90% of your code and
therefore that surely lives in a piece
of software that is inadequately tested
and likely to be of inadequate quality
we also saw that there are two broad
classes of coverage criteria practical
criteria that we can actually use in
theoretical criteria that are
interesting from a conceptual standpoint
but they are totally impractical they
are too expensive to be used on
real-world software and finally as we
also said at the beginning one of the
great things about white box testing and
coverage criteria is that they are fully
automated there are tools that can take
your code instrumented automatically and
when you run your test cases they will
tell you what is the level of coverage
that you achieved with your tests at no
cost for you so there's really no reason
not to measure coverage of your code</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
