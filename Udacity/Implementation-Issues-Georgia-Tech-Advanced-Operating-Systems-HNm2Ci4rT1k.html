scheduling policies let's discuss the
implementation issues of the scheduling
policies in an operating system one
possibility is the operating system to
maintain a global queue of all the
threats that are runnable in the system
and what these processes might do is
when they're ready for work they'll go
to this global queue and pick the next
available thread from this queue and run
that on itself and the way we organize
the queues is orthogonal to the
scheduling policy itself but if the
policy is something like FCFS it makes
sort of logical sense to have a global
queue and let the processors pick from
the queue the head of the queue is the
earliest arriving thread and therefore
first come first serve policy may use
this global queue policy this global
queue becomes very infeasible as an
implementation vehicle when the size of
the multiprocessor is really big because
then it's a huge data structure that all
these guys have to access centrally and
so on so typically what is done is to
keep local queues with every processor
and these local queues are going to be
based on affinity and the particular
organization of the queues in each of
these processes these local queues for
each of these processes is going to
depend on the specific policy that we're
going to use so if it is last processor
or is it fixed processor or is it the
minimum intervening or is it minimum
intervening plus queuing
all of those things will decide how
these local queues are going to be
maintained but the important point I
want to get across is that in
implementing the scheduling policies you
have to have a ready queue of threads
from which the processor will pick the
next piece of work to do and the
organization of this queues will be
based on the specific scheduling policy
that you might choose to employ for that
scheduler and it might be that processor
p2 runs out of work completely no
nothing in its local queue in that case
it might pull its peers queues in order
to get some work from other guys and run
it on that processor so that's something
that might be done and that is what is
called work stealing in the scheduling
literature so that
might be something that is commonly
employed in a multiprocessor scheduler
so I mentioned that the way these queues
are organized is based on policies that
the scheduler picks which might be
affinity based or it might be fairness
based and so on but in addition to the
policy specific attribute it might also
use additional information in order to
organize its queue in particular a
priority of a thread is determined by
three components now one component is
the affinity component assuming it's an
affinity based on a scheduling policy
but in addition to that it might also
use additional information so for
instance every thread may be born with a
certain priority so that is the base
priority that particular thread has when
it has started up and as I mentioned it
might depend on whether you know the
user gave a huge amount of money in
order to run his particular thread so
that is the base priority that you
associated with a thread and and of
course then you take the affinity into a
into account and in addition to that
there is this age coming in and this is
sort of like senior citizen discount if
a thread TI has been in the system for a
long long time you want to get it out of
the system as quickly as possible so
what you do is equivalent to giving a
senior citizen discount you boost the
priority of the thread by a certain
amount so that it gets to be at the head
of the queue and it'll get scheduled on
the processor p2 so basically the
priority attribute is what determines
the position in the queue for a
particular thread and as I said three
attributes that go with it
is the base priority that you may
associate with a thread when it is first
created the affinity that it has for a
particular processor and also the senior
citizen discount that he might give to a
particular thread depending on how long
it's been on the system</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
