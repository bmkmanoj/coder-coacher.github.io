here we are so we've sort of talked you
know very briefly about the photo
detectors now we're going to talk about
the ganglion cells one of the things
about the ganglion cells is that they
take information from these things
called these horizontal and bipolar
cells and the horizontal cells just as
you might think they take information
across a local area and bring them
together to the ganglion cells so you
might ask why would you do that why
would you do that Thank You Megan okay
there are a lot of reasons one of which
has to do with dynamic range in fact you
know let's go to this picture first and
then we'll go to the numbers so here's a
series of photographs where you adjust
the amount of light coming into the
image from a thousandth of a second to a
quarter of a second you see here there's
an outdoor part of the scene right there
so a thousandth of a second is enough
actually when you open it up a little
bit more it gets a little bit easier to
see these things and then as I let in
enough light that I can see the interior
really well this outdoor thing is
totally blown out and yet if you were to
stand there what you would see is
something that looks like this you'd
have no problem seeing the indoor stuff
and the outdoor stuff it might be a
little bit harder to see but not
anything like the camera and that's
because your system deals with dynamic
range so much more effectively okay
here's another example of photographing
a high dynamic range scene right so if
you wanted to see the stained glass
really well you'd have to miss the rest
of the inside of the church if you want
to see the rest of the inside the church
these things get blown out but you would
have no problem seeing this you would
see the beautiful stained glass and you
would see the church you now know that
there are a competition photography
methods called high dynamic range so you
have a high dynamic range on your iPhone
or your little phone or whatever or in
Photoshop something like that that's a
way of blending together a series of
pictures to automatically select which
regions from which image should be
selected or how much you dial up or dial
down each region of the image in order
to composite the whole thing into a high
dynamic range image</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
