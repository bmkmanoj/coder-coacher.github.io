the first thing we did was we executed
the plan for moving C on the D which was
to move D be an a all under the table
and then to move C on the D then having
done that we looked at the next goal and
we found out that most of the steps in
the plan for moving beyond see were
actually accomplished in the process of
moving C on D so we can actually go
ahead and put B on C here didn't we look
at the goal of having a on B and found
that all the steps for moving a onto B
had already been accomplished so we just
put a onto B directly that's good David
note that when we did this problem
previously using means and son analysis
and problem reduction we run into all
kinds of problems because plans were
clobbering goals and we had no way of
ordering these various goals now we have
a way that's the power of partial order
planning not also that this partial
order planning this AI algorithm makes
certain things that are implicit in
human reasoning explicit presumably when
you and I reason about these things we
must be reasoning something like this or
at least this is one hypothesis about
how we might be reasoning and we had
just made many other operations of human
reasoning so explicit and so precise</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
