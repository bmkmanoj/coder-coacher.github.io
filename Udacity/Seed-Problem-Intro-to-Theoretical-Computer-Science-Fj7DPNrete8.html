problem that we know to be np-complete
and that problem is sad so from now on
showing that other problems are
np-complete will get a lot easier
because we don't have to go through this
laborious process of encoding machines
anymore it will just suffice to show
that sat can be reduced to the problem
we're looking at so we can use Sat to
show other problems to be np-complete
now and once we have shown these
problems to be np-complete we can use
them as well to show again other
problems to be np-complete so we are
basically building this whole tree of
np-complete problems using sat as a seed
problem and it will just suffice to show
these reductions here we do not have to
do the same tedious steps of boolean
formula and coding anymore because we
already know SAP to be np-complete now
so let's take one step back now with our
next quiz so what happens if you show
one np-complete problem to be solvable
in polynomial time and by solvable in
polynomial time of course I mean on a
deterministic Ram what that mean that
some problems in NP can be solved in
polynomial time again we're talking
about a deterministic Ram here would it
mean that all np-complete problems are
solvable in polynomial time or would it
mean that all problems in NP are
solvable in polynomial time and again
more than one of these answers here can
be correct so please check every
statement that is correct</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
