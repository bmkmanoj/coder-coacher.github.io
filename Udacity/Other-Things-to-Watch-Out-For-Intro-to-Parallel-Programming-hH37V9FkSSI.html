to understand about the programming
model is that each CUDA block is
considered to be its own independent
program that means CUDA objects are
private to a block so streams and events
that you create inside a block can be
used by any thread in that block but
they can't be used by or exchanged with
any other block including your children
so that means you can synchronize on
kernels launched from within your block
but you cannot synchronize on work
launched by another block you can't pass
streams or events to your children have
them synchronize on it or you risk a
deadlock this is all part of
composability that we looked at a minute
ago and finally data that's private to a
block like shared memory for example is
private to that block that means you
cannot pass shared memory to your child
kernels so if I have a some data that my
block has accumulated inside memory
which is a pretty common thing to do in
CUDA I would have to write this out to
global memory in order for my child come
to see it
remember your child kernel is another
grid it's not the sets of blocks and the
first and most important rule is that
all the blocks are considered
independent programs so no passing
around a private data</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
