a small technical detail when we
considered our three problems vertex
cover independent set and clique we
always said that we were looking for the
best possible solution so for example
for the largest independent set or the
smallest vertex cover this type of
problem is known as an optimization
problem because we're trying to maximize
or minimize some value in this unit
we're mostly going to work with a
slightly different version of these
problems called decision problems so
we're not going to ask for example what
is the smallest possible vertex cover
but rather we're going to ask does a
graph have a vertex cover that is
smaller than some number K and K is
given to us in advance so the main
difference between an optimization
problem and a decision problem is that
for an optimization problem we ask find
us the best possible solution or what's
the best possible value that we can
achieve and in a decision problem we
have to ask is it possible to achieve a
value of K and so up here the answer
will be some number and down here the
answer can only be yes or no and there
are two main reasons why we do this
first of all it makes our lives much
easier and some of the proofs that we're
going to dive into and secondly it's
also a little bit more accurate because
when you talk about the P versus NP
problem although it's often stated for
optimization problems such as those we
have so far discussed the whole theory
has actually been developed for decision
problems now you're probably thinking
what difference does it make to talk
about an optimization problem versus a
decision problem or is this going to
make any significant difference for
example with a question of tractability
versus intractability and actually it
doesn't really make that much of a
difference but but I'll actually have
you figure out the details here in our
next quiz and I would like you to think
about four things and then give me your
answer so the first question is if the
optimization version of a problem turns
out to be tractable then what about the
decision version of that problem do we
know that decision version for sure to
be tractable intractable or can't we
really say the second question I have
for you is the same thing only with
intractability so if we know the
optimization version of a problem too
be intractable then what about the
decision version is that for sure going
to be tractable intractable or is this a
case where we can't really make a clear
statement having only this information
here that the optimization version is
intractable and finally questions number
three and four are exactly the other way
around then questions one and two so
here we have information about the
decision version of a problem so
question number three if the decision
version of a problem is tractable then
what about the optimization version and
question number four if the decision
version of a problem is intractable then
what about the optimization version so
please give your answers here with one
of each of the three possible choices
