compound inequality that's written in a
change form like this it's really the
same as having two inequalities joined
together with an and we know that with
this inequality X needs to lie between
negative 2 and six where two is included
in the interval so it's true that both x
is greater than equal to negative 2 then
we have X is less than six let's graph
each of these individually on a number
line and then the compound inequality on
the third one first we have that X is
greater than or equal to negative 2 or
in other words that negative 2 is less
than or equal to X then we have X is
less than six and then if we graph these
two together what we're really doing is
finding the shaded part of the number
line between the two that overlaps so if
for example I lay this number line on
top of this number line and I then shade
in the part that's overlapping I get
exactly what we have in the compound
inequality down here because of the and
we have a double restriction happening
and that further rains in the values
that X can equal to this smaller range
than we would have if we had either one
of these true on its own</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
