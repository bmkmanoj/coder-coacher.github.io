referred to as Pavlov named after the
Russian psychologist who was studying
gastric juices and then figured out how
animals learn so I don't know why it's
go in this particular case but here's
what the machine looks like it says
start off cooperating and as long as the
opponent keeps cooperating the cooperate
so so far it sounds a lot like tit for
tat if you defect then then move to the
defect state so okay it still looks a
lot like tit for tat and again this
defect state has two arrows coming out
of it but they're reversed from what
they were in to protect here it says if
you cooperate with me I will continue to
defect against you but if you defect
against me then I'm willing to cooperate
with you so that's a little strange
right that is a little strange so you
know the way to get me to stop defecting
against you is to defect against me and
then I become cooperative again so in
other words take advantage of you until
you sort of pull a trigger on me seems
like it yeah it's a funny thing so so
again so tit for tat is like repeat what
the opponent did Pavlov is basically
cooperate as long as we're agreeing if
we both defect I'll cooperate if we both
cooperate I'll cooperate but if we
disagree if I just if I defect and you
cooperate or you cooperate and I defect
then I will defect against you on the
next round that sort of makes sense
really yeah right i mean it says if
you're cooperating i'm going to
cooperate if we're both good we're going
to both start out cooperating and then
if you ever defect on me then you have
basically attacked me and so I'm going
to defect on you unless you start
cooperating again in which case I think
that you're you're being reasonable
because of what I did and so now we're
going to start cooperating it except
that's tit for tat no you're right
you're right I take it back it doesn't
make any sense yeah it's weird it's
weird too many of these too many fees
mm-hmm in Pavlov yeah two V's yet but
you can think of them as being like
arrowheads oh then that makes much more
sense yeah exactly okay yeah so it's
this weird thing where I will I'm going
to continue to defect against you until
you realize that I'm hurting you you
punch me once and now okay good we're
even again
we good yeah we're good oh this is like
men on a basketball court oh yeah sure
but now here's the question is this Nash
so we'll make that a quiz</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
