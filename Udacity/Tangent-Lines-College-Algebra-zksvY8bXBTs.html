symmetry of parabolas now when we were
talking about linear equations a super
vital part of everything that we talked
about was the slope of a line we can
find the slope of a line by taking any
two points along it and taking the ratio
of the difference between their Y
coordinates to the difference between
their x coordinates we have an however
consider the slope of a curve yet of the
graph of anything that isn't just a
straight line this may seem a little bit
funny to think about but I think it's
pretty important there isn't a single
slope that applies to every single point
along this curve we can talk about slope
in a local sense it's pretty easy to see
what the slope of a single part of the
curve is by picking a point on the line
let's say this one and drawing a line
that just touches the curve at that
point and has the same slope as the
curve does right there so for every
point in a curve we can see that there's
a line tangent to that point that has
the same slope as the curve at that
point and barely touches the curve right
there so it's actually really hard to
draw an exact tangent line but this is a
pretty good approximation if we pick two
points that are infinitesimally far away
from this point or in other words two
points they're as close as we could
possibly pick to this point that were
interested in we can draw the line
connecting those two points and then
extend that line tend up with the
tangent lines now you'll have to wait
for calculus to get a really deep and
rigorous understanding of tangent lines
but they're still really useful for us
for understanding the shapes of
parabolas and of other curves as well so
now I've drawn three different lines
that are tangent to three different
points on this parabola I've labeled
them a B and C and for each of those I'd
like you to tell me what the sign of the
slope of the line is is it positive
negative or zero check the proper box
for each line</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
