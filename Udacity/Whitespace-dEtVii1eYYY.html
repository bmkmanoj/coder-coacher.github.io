so you may have noticed when I was
entering text in the in the editor
before that even though I put text on
multiple lines when I rendered it in
HTML it rendered all on a single line
this is because in HTML all whitespace
new lines tab spaces all turn into a
single space to force our HTML to have
multiple lines we can use another tag
called the BR tag it looks like this it
is also a void tag stands for break and
it's a void tag and you put this after
after any lines that you want to appear
on multiple lines let's let's play run
with this in the browser a little bit
here we are in the browser let's let's
enter some text we've got this text
that's really too long for one line and
when we render this it appears as one
line let's put a line break here when I
render this it still appears as one line
if we want to render multiple lines we
can enter the BR tag like here no
problem and now we have a line break and
we can even enter multiple BR tags if we
want multiple line breaks okay there we
go two line breaks or two BRS equals two
line breaks cool huh
another way of doing line breaks is to
use the P tag this stands for paragraph
this is not a void tag so the P tag has
content and it looks like this so it's
the you know because it's not a voit AG
it has a closing tag and we have an
opening tag so you've got opening P
contact closing P and this will render
as one paragraph let's check this out on
the browser really quick okay so we've
got these two lines let's take a
different approach I'm going to start
this line with a paragraph tag and we'll
render this AHA now we've got a line
break here in our text now the font got
bigger and that's kind of a side effect
of our HTML tool there must be a some
sort of style set on P that doesn't
normally happen I'm going to wrap the
bottom line with a paragraph as well
okay there we go now we've got two lines
the same kind of basic ideas we had
before now we'll talk about why there's
this extra space in here even though
there's no space between the
next up here we'll come to that in a
minute but first quiz time take this
text here hello everyone we're using two
lines now and enter the HTML to draw
that as it's formatted here with two
lines and I want you to use the the BR
tag</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
