it finds the top K elements in no
particular order in big theta of n time
independent of K now remember the best
that we could do for the previous
algorithm is if K is large we ended up
using sorting which was n log n this is
always big data event or at least
expected running time the worst case can
be bad but there's a way of fixing that
as well so so this is pretty remarkable
and and you might find this to be quite
counterintuitive for example if the list
has n elements in it it takes us n log n
time to sort it how could it take us
less than that to find the top k if k is
equal to n well it's actually this
phrase here is really important in no
particular order so basically if you ask
me to find the top 100 elements in a
list of length 100 I don't have to do
anything right I can just give you back
the original list even if it's not
sorted I said the top 100 is exactly
these elements you know that this is
what you asked for so so that's why this
is not actually equivalent to sorting it
can be actually much more efficient than
sorting now what happens in the case
where we're looking for the top half
seems a little trickier right so in the
top half case we can still do this in
linear time even though sorting the
whole list is a natural way to do this
to split the top half from the bottom
half and that takes n log n so the key
step of this algorithm is going to be
the following simple subproblem kind of
interesting maybe even slightly
counterintuitive sub problem and that is
finding the rank of a given value in a
sorted list so we're given L unsorted
and we're given a value V and we'd like
to find out where V would appear if L
were sorted it's not sorted but if it
were sorted where would this value V
appear in the list now just 2 for the
simplicity of the discussion for now
let's assume that all the values in the
list are distinct so we're imagining
here we've got our list L and we pick
out some value V doesn't actually have
to be in the list but let's say it's in
the list and what we want to know is
where would v appear in L if that were
sorted say smallest to largest now one
way to solve this problem of course is
sore tell and then look for v but the
insight here is that we don't need to do
nearly that much work so how do we do it
let's look at a concrete example here's
Elle this is an unsorted list of unique
numbers they're all to do two numbers
just for my own sanity and writing them
down and then this is the sorted list l
it's the same elements but I put it put
them in order and let's consider the
number 66 say so here's 66 in the
original list how can we figure out just
by scanning through L where 66 is going
to end up in this list well what makes
it end up there it's in position what 0
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 in position eight so why
is it in position eight well Tim
position eight because there are exactly
eight elements in the list that are
smaller than 66 right because once we
once it sorted those eight elements are
going to be to its left and that's
what's going to put 66 in the eighth
position so we can just go through this
list making note of the elements that
are smaller than 66 3145 not 91 yes 5192
yes 28 yes 33 yes 11 no no yes yes for a
total of one two three four five six
seven eight elements so that's what
that's how we can know where 66 is going
to be in the sorted list even if I don't
tell you this sorted list in advance</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
