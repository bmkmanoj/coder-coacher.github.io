system know every node knows its own
events meaning what are the
computational events that are happening
in its own execution it also knows about
its communication events with the rest
of the nodes in the distributed system
so for instance if this process P I
sends a message to process PJ that's the
send event P I knows about that and
similarly PJ when it gets this event
it's a receive event it knows about that
so these are the only two kinds of
events that every node knows about its
own computational events and its
communication events with its peers for
instance process PJ has no idea about
the local computational events of Pi
lamport's logical clock builds on this
very simple idea and the idea is that we
want to associate a timestamp with every
one of the events that are happening in
every process in the entire distributed
system how are we going to do that well
we're going to have a local clock CI
over here and CJ over here and this
local clock can be anything can be
counter it can be a simple counter and
what we are doing is when I want to
associate a timestamp with a particular
event that's happening in my process
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
look at this counter and see what the
value of the counter is associate that
counter value as a timestamp for this
event a so for instance here I've said
that times time for a is two and this
counter monotonically increases as we
pile up events in our system so once I
have associated this timestamp to with
this event a I cannot associate the same
timestamp with other meaningful events
that are happening in my process and
therefore I'll increment the timestamp
it's completely up to your
implementation as to whether you want to
increase this counter value by one or
two by a thousand doesn't really matter
so in this case for instance I've
incremented the timestamp counter by two
and so the next event that I'm going to
have in my process be
is going to have a time stamp of four so
that's the idea behind having a
monotonically increasing counter to
associate logical time stamps of the
events that are happening in my process
now what about these communication
events well in particular let's look at
this case here a is a communication
event on process P I and this
communication event is going to have a
time stamp of two associated with it
because that's the time that I generated
this communication event sent this
message over comes over to process PJ
when process PJ receives this that's an
event and so let's say we call it event
number D and we have to associate now a
timestamp with with event D how do I go
about assigning a timestamp with this
well we know that this timestamp that
I'm going to associate with this event D
has to be greater than the time stamp
associated to the send of that message
right obviously you cannot receive a
message that has not been sent yet and
therefore we're going to say that D
should have a timestamp which is at
least greater than a for sure now what
else does D depend on well it depends on
other things that are happening in my
own process for that I need to know what
the current state of my local counter is
so for instance in my execution as I'm
showing you here I haven't done anything
meaningful yet and therefore my local
counter is still pointing to zero
indicating that there's been no
meaningful events here so when this
message comes that's the first time I'm
going to do something meaningful in this
process and I have to associate a
timestamp with D but I cannot associate
the timestamp at zero with it because
the timestamp that I associated D has
got to be greater than the timestamp
that is associated with the send event
on process P I and since the send event
has this timestamp too I have to
associate something higher than that and
so I associate a timestamp 3 with the
receipt of this message that is this
particular event is going to have a
timestamp of of 3 so the two conditions
that we have talked about one is that
events that are happening in the same
process I'm going to have a
monotonically
creasing counter and I'm going to use
that to associate timestamps with the
events that are happening in the same
process that's the first thing that is
if I have two events a and B in the same
process and I know that a happened
before B because textually in the
process because the process is
sequential a happened before B and
therefore the condition is that the
timestamp associated with a has got to
be less than the timestamp associated
would be pretty straightforward and
similarly the second condition is that
if I have two events a and B and a
happens to be a send event on some
process and D happens to be the receive
event on another process then we know
that the receive event has to be after
the send event and therefore the second
condition is that CI of a that is a
timestamp associated with the send event
has got to be less than the timestamp
associated with the receipt of the same
message CJ of D so in order to make this
condition the second condition valid
we're going to choose the timestamp to
associate with the receipt of a message
D as the max of the timestamp that is
associated with the send event
incremented by some quantity CI a plus
plus so in this case it happens to be
two so incremented and say three and
then you want to know what the local
counter is saying so CJ so what we pick
as a timestamp to associate with D is
the max of the incoming timestamp with
the message and the local counter
whatever it is pointing to so that's how
I'll pick the timestamp to associate
with a receive event this brings up a
very interesting question and that is
what about timestamp of events that are
happening concurrently in the
distributed system and before I talk
about that I want to give you a little
quiz</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
