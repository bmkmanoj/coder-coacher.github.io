cubed times the cube root of two x
squared Y now that's pretty amazing if
you got it right on your first try if
you stumbled a little bit that's
definitely okay see if you can find your
first mistake in the solution video and
then posit it to see if you can work
towards this answer we start by
simplifying the cube root of 54 and the
cube root of 16 we want to split this up
in a 27 times two this allows us to take
the cube root of twenty-seven which we
know is three the same is true for 16 we
split it up into eight times too so we
can take the cube root of eight so for
this first radical we know the cube root
of twenty-seven equals three this to
stays inside of the radical since we
don't have the two repeated three times
now we can use power divided by root to
simplify our variables for x we'll have
eight divided by 3 which equals two
remainder to this means we'll have x
squared on the outside of our radical
and x squared on the inside of a radical
for the variable Y will have 10 divided
by 3 which equals three remainder 1 this
means we'll have y cubed on the outside
of a radical and one why are just Y on
the inside of a radical for the second
radical we want to take the cube root of
8 which equals to this to just stays
inside the radical for the variable X
will use power divided by root this
gives us one remainder 2 so we'll have
1x outside of our radical and x squared
inside of a radical for y we'll have two
remainder 1 so y squared on the outside
and y to the one on the inside we
multiply these numbers together to get
9x cubed y cubed over here we multiply
them as well we'll have 4x to the third
and y cubed notice that this term and
this term has x cubed y cubed times the
cube root of two x squared Y this means
that they're like so really we're just
going to do 9-4 and then multiply it by
the trailing variables in radical nine
minus four equals five so this is our
final result</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
