is I'm giving you these four page
faulting scenarios and I want you to
fill in the table with what happens to
the boundary between the local and the
global split on each node and this
column is giving you the location of the
faulting page where it is in the entire
system and this column is saying what
happens to the split of LNG on the
faulting node what happens to the split
of LNG on the node that happens to have
the faulting page and what happens to
the split between LNG for the node that
has the globally oldest page the LRU
page in the entire cluster which will be
the victim of page replacement throwing
it out onto the disk if some page has to
be gotten out of the cluster because the
memory pressure in the entire cluster
exceeds the total memory that's
available in the entire cluster now the
first choice is the faulting page X is
in Q's global cache that's the first
choice in that case I want you to think
about what happens to the split of LNG
on the node P note Q and node R and the
second case faulting page X is in the
global part of Q and the difference is
P's global is already empty
in the first case peace global was not
empty so I wanted you to think about the
split between LNG on note P as well in
the second case I'm saying it is similar
to the first one with the difference
that P's global cache is empty and the
third case is the faulting page is on
the disk it is not in the cluster memory
of any of the nodes in the last case is
when this faulting page X is actively
shared by both P and Q all of these
cases are the ones that we just
discussed and so I just wanted you to
think about it and fill in this table</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
