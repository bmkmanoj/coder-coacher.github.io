selection process is to prefer a route
with the higher local preference value
the local preference value is simply a
numerical value that a network operator
in the local a s can assign to a
particular route this attribute is
purely local it does not get transmitted
between autonomous systems so it is
dropped in ebgp route advertisements but
it allows a local network operator the
ability to explicitly state that one
route should be preferred over the other
among routes with equally high local
preference values BGP prefers routes
with shorter AAS path length the idea is
that a path might be better if it
traverses a fewer number of autonomous
systems the third step involves
comparison of multiple routes advertised
from the same autonomous system the
multi exit discriminator value allows
one AAS to specify that one exit point
in the network is more preferred than
another so lower med values are
preferred but this step only applies to
compare routes that are advertised from
the same autonomous system because the
neighboring a s sets the meed value on
routes that it advertises to a neighbor
med values are not inherently comparable
across routes advertised from different
a SS therefore this step only applies to
routes advertised from the same AAS
fourth BGP speaking routers inside an
autonomous system will prefer a BGP
route with a shorter IGP path cost to
the IGP next up the idea here is that if
a router inside an autonomous system
learns two routes via I BGP then it
wants to prefer the one that results in
the shortest path to the exit of the
network this behavior results in what is
called hot potato routing where an
autonomous system sends traffic to the
neighboring autonomous system via a path
that traverses as little of its own
network as possible finally if there are
still multiple
full routes with the highest possible
local preference the shortest AAS path
and the shortest
IGP path the router uses a tie-break to
pick a single best route this
tiebreaking step is arbitrary it might
be the most stable or the route that's
been advertised the longest but often to
induce determinism operators typically
prefer that this tiebreaking step is
performed based on the route
advertisement from the router with the
lowest router ID which is typically the
neighboring routers IP address let's now
take a closer look into local preference
AAS path length multi exit discriminator
and hot potato routing now as I
mentioned the first step in the route
selection process is for routers to
prefer routes with higher local
preference values now an operator can
actually set the local preference value
on incoming BGP route advertisements to
affect which route a router ultimately
selects let's see how this works</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
