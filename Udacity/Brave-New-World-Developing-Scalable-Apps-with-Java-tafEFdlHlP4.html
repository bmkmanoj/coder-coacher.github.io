needed a brave new world a completely
new approach to building applications
needed to be developed that could scale
to meet the demands of the rapidly
growing Internet not a key step to
building a scalable system is you need
to decouple it from executing on a
single computer you design a scale out
architecture as your application scales
outside the scope of a single computer
and this distributed architecture needs
to be a so-called share nothing
architecture meaning that it must not
depend on any shared resources that can
become the bottleneck this way if your
application needs a scale you can just
provide more computers to provide the
additional capacity required that means
you can run your application on all the
things and to get even more flexibility
the concept of virtual machines was born
which enables you to decouple a physical
machine from the application execution
machine this had great flexibility games
since the infrastructure turned virtual
you would now run your scale-out
application on several virtual machines
instead of physical computers problem
solved right
you can now scale indefinitely by adding
the standard building blocks of
performance that your application can
utilize and you have decoupled your
application from a specific execution
machine great now only one question
remains
how do you design your application to be
able to scale like this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
