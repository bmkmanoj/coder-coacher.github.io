online class that would be equal or
better and quality to our Stanford class
but to bring it to anyone in the world
for free we send out one email we are
offering our class to the world free of
charge and within two weeks 50,000
people had signed up for it and that
grew to 160,000 students from 209
countries the online medium was quite
amazing we decided to to flip the entire
way we teach rather than lecturing
students we decided to quiz students a
student said this class felt like
sitting in a bar with a really smart
friend who's explaining something you
haven't grasped but are about to and
that's exactly what we were aiming for
we're now offering the historic AI class
again on the Udacity platform so come
join us it's the old technology still
paper and pencils but you can take this
class for free at your own pace at
Udacity calm</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
