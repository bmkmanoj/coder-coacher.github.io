a router an ISP or a data center might
have a router that looks like a big
chunky box with a lot of cables going
into it in general a router is a device
that connects two different IP networks
it acts as a gateway hosts on one
network that want to send traffic to the
other one forward that traffic through
the router while most hosts might have
only one interface with an interesting
ipv4 address on it a router will have
two or more a host on a local network
knows about a default gateway which is a
router that's connected toward the rest
of the internet computers that are
attached to the same switch or Wi-Fi
access point or other network Hardware
are normally local to each other they
can directly send packets to one another
without going through a different
network and as we saw before they have
IP addresses on the same net block but
here's Alice over here at 192 0 2 at 104
and here's Chandra over here at 1 98.5 T
1 dot 117 those aren't on the same local
network so if this host wants to send
traffic over here it has to pass through
this router the default gateway may also
have a default gateway itself but
eventually as you go toward the rest of
the Internet you'll eventually reach the
default list part where routers on major
transit ISPs know about the global
routing table the directory of all
public IP networks routers up there
don't have default gateways</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
