dashboard reveals about the path that
users take to buy products you go to the
shopping behavior page and you should
now see some sessions with transactions
now let's look at the checkout behavior
so this screen shows the sessions where
users got as far as the checkout step so
we had seven sessions where they started
checkout and two sessions that ended in
a transaction we'll look more into how
you can track users progress through the
checkout process in a minute
now let's look at the product
performance screen earlier you saw that
this screen shows all the products that
have been included in analytics hits but
up until now there was zero revenue
associated with any of them would you
expect that to change now that some
actual sales have occurred oh and it has
15 dollars for dinner so here we see the
revenue for the products that were
included in the purchase actions you can
drill down into the products to get more
details so we see that these three
dinners here got bought as money
associated with them and these other
dinners did not get bought so again you
can set a secondary dimension if you
want to see the labels for the products
ecommerce product variant and now I can
see which dinners were the ones that got
bought so the product SKU also
pronounced SKU is the ID for the product
SKU is a stock keeping unit it's
something that retailers use to uniquely
identify each product they sell so here
it's called product SKU but here in the
code we talked about the product ID and
actually it's just the ID the method
that sets it is set ID you can drill
down into the products I didn't set any
coupon codes or affiliations but you can
see that this is where they would show
up if you'd set them you can also see
other kinds of information such as a
quantity that got added to the cart and
the quantity that got removed from the
cart and of course for a remove cart hit
to be registered you'd actually have to
write the code
to send that hit in the method that
implemented the removal cart action</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
