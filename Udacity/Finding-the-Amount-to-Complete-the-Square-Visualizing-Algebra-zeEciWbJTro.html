complete the square and turn each
expression into a perfect score batting
a certain amount the amount that we
added in each case depended upon this B
coefficient for the X term and the first
example the B term was a six and we
ended up having to add 9 to make a
perfect square and the second example RB
was 12 and we ended up adding 36 pieces
to get a perfect square and the third
case B was negative 4 and we added 4
pieces and in the last case B was
negative 10 and we added 25 so for any
value of B how much do you think we need
to add in order to complete the square
in other words see if you can look and
find a pattern between these two numbers
how do we go from this B to the added
amount now you might think the answer
would be B plus 3 but we know that can't
be correct sure if we add 3 here we get
9 but if I added 3 to 12 I would get 15
and not 36 so what expression could be
right here that uses the letter B and
gives us the appropriate value the
expression should work for each of the
four cases and be sure to take some time
to think about it this one's tough if
you get stuck look for a hint and the
instructors comment</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
