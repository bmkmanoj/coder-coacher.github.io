lot of stuff about IP addresses why do
we care so much about them anyway so all
traffic on the Internet is split up into
messages called packets and each packet
has the addresses of its source or
sender and its destination or intended
recipient on it like when you use ping
you're sending a steady stream of
packets to a particular destination and
hopefully you're getting a steady stream
back so each server or other host that
you want to talk to it needs to have a
distinct IP address now that would be
fine but there aren't enough IP
addresses for all the computers today
remember there's about four billion ipv4
addresses available for hosts and
there's seven billion people on the
planet to make it worse big institutions
that have been on the internet since
forever are using way more than their
fair share of addresses and the
addresses to people ratio in the u.s. is
actually a lot higher than in the rest
of the world especially Latin America
Asia and Africa at the end of this
lesson I'll tell you more about how
we're fixing this problem but before we
get there I have to confess that I've
been lying to you about something</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
