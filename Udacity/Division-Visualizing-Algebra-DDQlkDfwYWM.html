division is the inverse of
multiplication so it should also take
higher priority over addition and
subtraction so we know in our hierarchy
of the order of operations
multiplication and division should come
first let's consider this problem
negative 3 plus 24 / 4 times 3 here are
the two expressions that I could write
this first expression has the
parentheses around the 24 and the for
the second one has parentheses around
the 4 and the 3 and this problem it's
unclear whether or not we're dividing
just by 4 or dividing by 4 times 3 we
assume that this is true whenever we see
the division symbol without parentheses
the number immediately after it is
included are divided into the number
before it so there's no need to solve
this problem here's one other word of
caution whenever we think about
simplifying this expression we don't
actually want to use pemdas if you've
heard of Pentos then you probably
remember that multiplication comes
before division but this is not
necessarily true multiplication division
have the same priority whenever we do
the order of operations students who
learn that multiplication come first
using PEMDAS would be incorrect we know
we should carry out this division before
we do the multiplication and general we
should think about doing our
simplification from left to right
because multiplication division have the
same priority and the order of
operations so these parentheses are
assumed to be the case so let's evaluate
this expression i have negative 3 plus 6
times 3 and negative 3 plus 18 negative
3 plus 18 makes 15 and doing our order
of operations it's important to remember
the hierarchy that multiplication
division have the same priority and
should be done from left to right in the
order of operations</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
