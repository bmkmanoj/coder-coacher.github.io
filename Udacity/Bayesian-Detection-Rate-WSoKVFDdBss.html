detection rate we can use the Bayes
theorem to expand this and we got this
formula here P I is the probability of
attacks meaning this is the probability
of intrusion evidence in a data an
intuitive example is that on a typical
day what's the percentage of packets
that contain intrusion activities in our
network there's an interesting
phenomenon about patient detection rate
called the base rate fallacy even if the
false alarm rate is very low as long as
it is not zero then the patient
detection rate is still low even if the
base rate is also very low for example
using the formula in the previous slide
if we plug in these numbers meaning the
detection rate is hundred percent false
alarm rate is ten to the minus five and
the base rate is two times ten to minus
five then the Bayesian detection rate is
only 66% in other words one third of the
time when the ideas produces an alert
there's no intrusion if you look at
these numbers more carefully one
hundred-percent detection rate is
perfect for armed rain of ten to the
minus five is also great this is not
zero pass is very very low so you may
ask is this low base rate realistic this
is two times ten to the minus five it
depends on where do you measure at the
base rate for example if you measure
base rate at the network packet level
meaning that the number of packets that
contain intrusion activities which can
be hundreds or thousands to a total
number of packets in a network which can
be tens of hundreds of millions then
this base rate can be quite realistic so
the base rate fallacy says that as long
as the false alarm rate is not zero then
when the IDS produces an alert the
probability that of intrusion has
actually occurred is also low so how do
we address this problem we can reduce
the false alarm rate to be zero or as
much as possible in fact that's what the
vendors of ideas have been trying to do
or we can deployed ideas to the
appropriate layer so that at that layer
the pay
rate is sufficiently high modern-day
ideas use a hierarchical architecture to
achieve this we can also use multiple
independent models this is similar to
medical diagnosis where multiple tests
are used to reduce the overall false
positive rate and increase the beige
indication rate</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
