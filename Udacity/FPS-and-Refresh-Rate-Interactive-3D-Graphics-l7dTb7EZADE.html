usable but not very fast
in fact for video games the minimum rate
is often 30 frames per second or even 60
frames per second these numbers are not
arbitrary but are tied to the hardware
itself most monitors these days at least
in America refresh at 60 Hertz which
means display the image 60 times a
second this is called the refresh rate
this value is part of the monitor itself
not something that varies this value of
60 Hertz gives an upper limit on the
frame rate the number of new images per
second however an application can
certainly have fewer frames per second
so for example say it takes us a tenth
of a second to compute and display each
new image this would mean our frame rate
is 10 frames per second the display
itself may refresh that is send its
stored image to the screen 60 times a
second but most of those images will be
the same in fact each computed image
will be refreshed six times on the
screen in the film industry the frame
rate is 24 frames per second however the
refresh rate can be 48 or 72 Hertz with
each frame repeatedly projected 2 or 3
times
it surprises people that the frame rate
of film is so low compared to computer
games with rates like 60 frames per
second I won't go into the details in
this course but the key reason that film
can have such a comparatively low rate
is that film captures what is called
motion blur when a frame is captured by
the camera objects moving will be
slightly blurred this gives a smoother
experience and so a lower frame rate is
possible a fair bit of research has been
done in the field of computer graphics
to rapidly create frames with motion
blur since they look more realistic see
the additional course materials for more
on this topic however a film is not
interactive a faster frame rate in an
application also allows a faster
reaction time giving a more immersive
feel</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
