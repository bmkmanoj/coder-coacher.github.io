iOS health app here is the table for
health data if we dissect the content
view for each cell we see a uiimageview
a uilabel in another uiimageview here in
the Maps app you can see that as I type
the table is rapidly being repopulated
but the components of the small views
the magnifying glass icon the placement
of the text those are repeating in both
health kit and maps you see an image
here on the Left margin and you see the
same font in the text field these top
views are instances of the same view
class the search bar is a stock view
that we're going to use as well in our
practice apps if I return to the map of
San Francisco and drop a pin on Golden
Gate Park clicking that pin gives me
another table view here are the cell
separators are similar to the ones we
just saw but there are no image views
and each cell contains a button here in
my contacts the table view cells are
separated into sections but in this
lesson we're just going to stick to one
section here in the album's table of the
Photos app we see a similar structure
but the smaller views are formatted a
little differently the image views are
larger and we see two labels with custom
font sizes stop for a moment and think
about which of the pixels on this screen
are actually drawn for the table view
per se because the screen is filled up
with these smaller repeating views the
pixels that are being drawn are
contained in these smaller views these
small repeating views are called cells
they're subclasses of uitableviewcell
which is a uiview tables tile the cell
views vertically and drawing separators
think about the different tables and
their similarities what kind of data is
necessary to populate a table</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
