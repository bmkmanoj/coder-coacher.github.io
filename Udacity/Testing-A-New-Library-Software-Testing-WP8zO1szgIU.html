have some large software under test and
part of it is a library that's been
flaky and has been giving us problems so
let's say this library is implementing
numerical functions and these numerical
functions have been sometimes throwing
floating-point exceptions and crashing
our system so what happens is the vendor
has given us a new version but we don't
want to do is just roll is just roll
that directly into our production system
because in the past we've gotten burned
by that sort of thing where we deploy a
new version and it contains flaws that
were worse than the flaws in the
previous version so we're gonna do is
we're going to spend some time checking
this thing out and trying to make sure
that it even if it's not that great it's
at least not worse than the previous
version so the question I have for you
is what kind of testing is this most
like is a unit testing is it white box
testing is it black box testing or on
the other hand is it stress testing ok
please take a minute to mark what you
think is the best answer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
