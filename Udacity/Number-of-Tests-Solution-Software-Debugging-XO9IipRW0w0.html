one by one when all tests fail that's an
interesting situation it's rather
unlikely but let's assume this actually
happens then we split the inputs
initially into two subsets removing the
first subset fails we proceed with this
subset n remains to ever do this again
and we split again the input into two
subsets and two subsets again and two
selves at the M and this is exactly like
binary search described by königin and
pike which is logarithmic the next
answer when there always is a half that
can be removed and fails this is the
same situation except that we may have
to remove the first half first and
getting a pass but still in terms of
complexity it's still logarithmic in
proportion to the size of the input and
therefore this is a nice situation in
which Delta debugging is very very
effective this is actually one of the
strengths of Delta debugging that if she
can't split the input in it into two
halves and one of them fails then it
behaves like a binary search and by
increasing the granularity later on then
it's no longer as efficient in the
number of tests but it's very very
thorough by trying to remove small parts
one after the other so it's like a
binary search in the beginning super
efficient and then it's as thorough as
trying to remove every single part after
another when all tests pass and then
Delta debugging does not need a
logarithmic number of tests that's
that's more like that's more like a
linear number of tests and never that
it's not the case because in these
situations then indeed the number of
tests is logarithmic so this is the
answer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
