interactive website that's ever been
created let's Bruce it up a bit by
adding an order manager to it that will
track what we're eating H day will build
up this order manager with templates
controllers and a service will need to
create the service that will be
responsible for managing the orders this
service will need to keep track of what
has been ordered for each day to do that
we can create a simple object to keep
track of each day's items we also need
to keep track of the currently selected
day so the user will know which day
they're ordering a menu item for for
this service to be useful it needs to
manage this data consumers of this
service should be able to get the
current list of orders they should also
be able to get and set the active day
and last they should be able to choose
an item for a meal and then remove an
item from a meal the order manager is
now capable of tracking anything the
user wants to eat for any meal let's
create a template in controller to let
the user keep track of their menu items
we need a template that will display our
orders and a controller that will set
the initial state for the templates
expressions now let's add that template
to the page to get the data to our
template we need to inject the order
manager service into the controller
remember we do that by passing an array
of items to inject and then the
controller function as the last item in
the array now we can set the list
property of the controller to the orders
returned by the order manager the
controller is all set so we can now
start modifying the template we want to
show the orders for each meal and we
want to repeat this list for every day
that means we need the ng-repeat
directive the first time through day
will be Monday and menu category will be
this object so now let's add the data to
our template so we can now track orders
but the user doesn't have any way to
pick a menu item in the menu template
will add this section where the user can
pick when they want to eat this menu
item and we'll need a button to let them
actually pick the meal when the user
clicks on this button will send along
the items name and when they want to eat
it will need to create this choose item
function so in men UJS will create it
order information is managed by the
order manager service so we need to
inject it into this
controller so we can pass along the data
order manager already has a method to
let us add an item so we'll just pass
the data to it now we can select an item
and choose when to eat it and add it to
the order manager how cool is that
except we can only pick items for Monday
let's fix that in the order template we
need to make it so that when we click on
a specific day we'll update the order
managers active day to that one so if
Tuesday's clicked will pass that along
and tell order manager to update its
active data Tuesday we just made a bunch
of modifications to our app and it's
really starting to come together if you
got lost along the way just step back
and remember what we're trying to do
services maintain our data we inject
services into controllers so that
controllers have access to that data and
then we display that data in templates
and again surfaces aren't tied to
specific views or controllers as we saw
with the order manager service that we
inject it into two separate controllers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
