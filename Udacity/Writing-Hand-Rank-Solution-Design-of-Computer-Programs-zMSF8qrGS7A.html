the code I think it's pretty
self-explanatory so I won't go through
all the details I'll just mention a few
things so first of all notice that it's
returning a tuple consisting of the
major rank and then the tiebreakers and
it just goes through them all in order
eight seven six five four three two one
zero
and then the interesting part is one how
do you determine what major rank it is
so we test to see if it's a trait flush
then it's number eight that straight
flush another example if you have three
of a kind and you also have two of a
kind then that's a full house which is
number six and then what are the
tiebreakers well they're the important
cards first that are part of the thing
so with full house the most important
tiebreaker is the three of a kind
and then the next most most important is
the two of the kind and we pick out what
each one is put them in that return
value to break the ties and final thing
I'll note is that card ranks is defined
to return the ranks in sorted order so
that for example when you have nothing
just returning the ranks that means that
the highest card is first that's going
to be the first tiebreaker the next
highest card a second that's next tie
breaker and so on and that's all you
need to know</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
