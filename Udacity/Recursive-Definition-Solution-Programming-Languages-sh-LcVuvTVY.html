are Fibonacci of six equals eight well
if n is 1 2 3 4 5 6 we said that
Fibonacci of n was one one two three
five eight it does look like Fibonacci
of six equals eight great it's Fibonacci
of n always less than or equal to n plus
1 well one is less than or equal to 2 2
is less than or equal to 3 1 is less
than or equal to 15 is less than equal
to 8 this is certainly true the
Fibonacci sequence is strictly non
decreasing it either stays the same or
gets bigger this next one was a bit of a
ringer a bit of a trick the vast
majority of the time almost always all
but finitely often Fibonacci of n is
strictly greater than Fibonacci of n
plus 1 except right here at the start
when fibonacci of 1 in fibonacci of 2
are both 1 so they're equal rather than
less than so no dice there is Fibonacci
of 20 greater than a thousand yes this
sequence grows super fast let's just go
check I'll just write out the definition
of Fibonacci right here I'm declaring a
procedure called fib oh it takes an
argument n here's our base case if n is
less than or equal to 2 return 1
otherwise we call ourselves recursively
two times and the answer is 6765 wow
that's immense notably it's bigger than
the 1,000 we were asking about true</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
