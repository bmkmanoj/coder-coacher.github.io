subclasses three parts they are
supervised learning yeah
unsupervised learning and reinforcement
work so what do you think supervised
learning is so I think of supervised
learning as being the problem of taking
labeled datasets gleaning information
from it so that you can label new
datasets that's fair I call that
function approximation hmm so here's an
example supervised learning I'm gonna
give you an input in an output and I'm
gonna give it to his pairs and I want
you to guess with the function sure okay
okay one one uh-huh two four wait hang
on is one input and one the output yes
and two the input for the output correct
all right I think I'm onto you three
uh-huh
nine okay or sixteen nice five twenty
five six thirty six seven forty-nine
nice this is a very hip dataset it is
what's the function it's hip to be
squared exactly maybe you believe that's
true then tell me if the input is ten
what's the output one hundred and that's
right if it turns out in fact that the
function is x squared but the truth is
we have no idea where the function is x
squared not really I have a pretty good
idea you do well does that idea come
from
it comes from having spoken with you
over a long period of time and plus you
know math n plus math well I'm using Sam
wrong you're wrong
yes I was wrong no you've talked to me
for a long time and plus math I agree
with that okay but I'm gonna claim that
you're making a leap of faith despite
being a scientist by deciding that the
input is ten in the output is 100 sure I
would agree with that
what's that leap of faith well I mean
from what you told me it's still
consistent with lots of other mappings
from input/output like ten gets mapped
to eleven right where everything's x
squared except ten sure where
everything's x squared up to ten right
that would be mean that would be me but
it's not logically impossible it would
it be the media aha thank you very much
I was saving that one up</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
