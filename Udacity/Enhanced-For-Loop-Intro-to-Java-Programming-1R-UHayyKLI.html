you have to completely rethink the
approach previously we looked at a
picture and the one to the left but when
we use an enhanced for-loop we only get
to look at one picture at a time so we
have to remember something from the past
the way I've done it is I would remember
the rightmost position of the previous
picture let me show you I have an
enhanced for-loop
and when I'm done positioning the
picture I remember its rightmost x value
so when every enter the loop with the
next picture then I can position it ten
further than the rightmost x value and
they'll all be spaced apart nicely what
about the first picture if I start the
rightmost X at zero then the first
picture ends up at offset ten so that's
the answer and now when you look at
these two loops you can see that we can
actually merge them so we do the
positioning and drawing in a single loop
that's enough about pictures for right
now Sara will show you another
application of array lists she'll
revisit a class that you've seen in
lesson three the person class that
collected friends at that time we did it
in a less than perfect way by just
having one long string of friend names
now that you know how to collect objects
she'll collect the friends in an
ArrayList all right over to you Sara</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
