brute-force algorithm for enumerated all
the strings in a grammar step by step
and brute force is actually a technical
term which means to try all of the
options exhaustively and typically the
brute force solution is easy to code but
relatively inefficient
in fact our brute force solution was so
inefficient it might go on forever
consider this grammar for balanced
parentheses we know how to enumerate
strings in the language of this grammar
suppose I give you the input open open
close and we want to know if it's in the
language of this grammar well in our
brute-force approach we would just
enumerate things we'd say oh well one
thing is the empty string is your input
the empty string no another string in
the language of this grammar is open
close are you open close no another
string in the language of this grammar
is open open close close is that you
nope how about open open open close
close close still no about 4 opens
followed by 4 closes you are getting
farther away so cold this is the wrong
direction so the algorithm that we
described would enumerate all of these
strings and many more infinitely many
more never noticing that we're never
really gonna match this we're making
strings that are too big this is all
just wasted work I don't need to check 5
1 2 3 4 5 if 5 opens followed by 5
closes corresponds to this input string
this has 10 characters it is way too
long so that's a clear inefficiency in
our previous brute-force algorithm and
that key insight that we can stop
somewhere around here is what's going to
lead us to a more efficient parsing
strategy thus our key parsing idea we're
gonna win by being lazy and not
duplicating work and we don't want to do
any unnecessary work we want to be super
lazy and in fact here we've got a lazy
person on a bed sleeping you can tell it
to bed because I can't sketch in fact
this notion that laziness is a virtue
for programmers is widely celebrated
Larry wall the designer and inventor of
Perl PE RL
the pathologically eclectic rubbish
Lister a language that we won't be
describing in this class claims in his
textbooks we will encourage you to
develop the three great virtues of a
programmer laziness impatience and
hubris sign me up those sound like great
ways to lead one's life but perhaps for
computer programming they actually are
the notion for laziness is it's this
quality that makes you go to great
effort to reduce overall energy
expenditures in other words I want to
spend five minutes now to save five
hours later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
