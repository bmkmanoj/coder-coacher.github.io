further by replacing this with a special
symbol and replacing these with
something shorter the symbol we'll use
for sum is this Sigma and instead of
writing out the whole salary of
geography majors we'll just call this X
and instead of writing out number of
geography majors we'll just call this n
for number so now we have a really nice
formula for the mean X bar equals the
sum of X divided by n isn't that pretty
now remember this is for a sample and
you saw in Lesson one that the sample
statistic is denoted by X bar for a
population we denote it by mu and again
we can say it's the sum of x divided by
big n because this is the number in the
entire population or as this is the
number in the sample now this might look
Greek to you well it is Sigma is the
Greek capital letter S which makes sense
because it means sum when you see Sigma
and then X this is telling you to add
everything that comes after the Sigma
and actually sometimes there will be a
little I here and this is going from I
equals 1 to n meaning that we sum x1
plus x2 all the way to X N and then
divide by the total number so in this
case this is X 1 this is X 2 X 3 X 4 and
X 5 and n is 5 so this is telling us
that we sum everything from X 1 all the
way to X n now don't be intimidated by
these symbols in fact I'm hoping that
you're going to get more and more
comfortable with using symbols
throughout the course it's let by the
end none of this seems intimidating the
reason I want you to feel comfortable
using symbols is because they're very
important and they'll help you with your
mathematical thinking in every class
symbols are like the alphabet the
alphabet is basically symbols and we use
these symbols to tell a story we've used
them to learn
people from hundreds of years ago who
have written their thoughts in these
symbols now it's the same with math
except since math is a different kind of
language we have different symbols and
math is a universal language these
symbols are used across the world which
is really awesome
mathematics is a way of thinking and it
has evolved over thousands of years and
the way we symbolize these thoughts has
evolved with it this statistical
notation is shortened counted
instructions that tell us what to do</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
