collection of NP complete problems but
given that there are thousands of known
NP complete problems we've only
scratched the surface in fact we haven't
even come close to carps mark of 21
problems from his 1972 paper if you want
to go on and extend the set of problems
that you can prove to be np-complete you
might consider reducing subset sum to
the knapsack problem where one has a
fixed capacity for carrying stuff and
wants to pack the largest value subset
of items that will fit another classic
problem is that of the Traveling
Salesman he has a list of cities that he
wants to visit and he wants to know the
order that will minimize the distance
that he has to travel one can prove that
this problem is np-complete by first
reducing vertex cover to the Hamiltonian
cycle problem which asks if there is a
cycle on a graph that visits each vertex
exactly once and then Hamiltonian cycle
to traveling salesman another classic
problem is 3d matching 2d matching can
be thought of as the problem of making
as many compatible couples as possible
from a set of people 3d matching extends
this problem further by matching them
with a home that they would enjoy living
in together and of course there are many
others the point of this lesson however
is not so that you can produce the
needed chain of reductions for every
problem known to be np-complete rather
it is to give you a sense for what these
arguments look like and how you might go
about making such an argument for a
problem that is of particular interest
to you the reductions we've given as
examples are a fine start but if you
want to go further in understanding how
to use complexity to understand real
world problems take a look at the
classic text by Gary and Johnson on
computers and intractability even though
it's from the same decade as the
original cook Levin result and carps
list of 21 NP complete problems it's
still one of the best as Lance says a
good computer scientist shouldn't leave
home without it now that you have a
better understanding of the nature and
scope of the P versus NP question will
return to a high level in the next
lesson and ask questions like what would
happen if P were equal to NP what good
might we be able to do and in a world
where p is not equal to NP what are the
hopes for coping with the NP
completeness of problems that we would
really like to solve</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
