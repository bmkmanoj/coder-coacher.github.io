iteration in almost every iteration
developers perform the following
activities so they identify which pieces
of functionality this iteration will
develop will implement after doing that
they will create a design for the
considered use cases and then we'll do
that
guided by the chosen architecture so the
set of use cases plus the architectural
guidelines will result in a design for
the selected use cases once the design
is defined then the developers will
implement the design which will result
in a set of software components they
will then verify the components against
the use cases to make sure that the
components satisfy the use cases they
suitably realize the use cases and they
will do that through testing or some
other verification and validation
activity finally after verifying that
the code actually implements the use
cases they will release a product which
also represent the end of the iteration
and not is that what I put here is Dino
an icon for the world in double quotes
because in many cases the release will
be just an internal release or maybe a
release they will just go to some of the
stakeholders so that they can provide
feedback on that okay so it doesn't have
to be an external release doesn't have
to be a release to the world but it is
nevertheless a release of a software
product</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
