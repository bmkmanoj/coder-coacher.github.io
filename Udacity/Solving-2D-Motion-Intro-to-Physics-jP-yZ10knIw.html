classic two-dimensional motion problem
before we get into it though let's
remind ourselves of the equations we
learned in one-dimensional motion
well these equations relate a few
variables Delta X initial velocity time
acceleration and velocity which we
called some final velocity I'm going to
write those over here to fully
understand an object's motion in one
dimension we like to somehow decide what
the values were for all of these
variables one two-dimensional motion I
said we're just solving two of these
one-dimensional problems so we need to
make some copies Delta X is gonna
partner with Delta y b0 ah wait fees
here I'm going to call V zero X like I
did over here to distinguish between
whether the velocity is horizontal or
vertical its partner will be V zero Y
there's going to be two accelerations
one in the X direction and one in the Y
likewise two final velocities
interestingly enough however there's
only going to be one time there's no x
and y version of time because unlike
position velocity and acceleration well
there's no easy way to assign a
direction to time in physics we call
time a scalar and these other quantities
are vectors you don't have to worry
about the vocabulary for now if we want
to know the trajectory of this ball as
it travels through the air our goal is
to get numerical answers for each of
these quantities some we can already
fill in V 0 X I know will be 10 meters
per second this is a number that I just
gave you at the start of the problem
what about Delta Y can you tell me what
Delta Y will be in meters</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
