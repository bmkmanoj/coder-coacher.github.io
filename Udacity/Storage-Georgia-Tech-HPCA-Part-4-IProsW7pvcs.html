storage in a computer system it keeps
all the files the programs the data all
the settings the operating system
everything and also our virtual memory
is implemented using storage because we
cannot fit all the data that the
application actually wants to access to
physical memory some of those pages are
actually on disk and when the program
accesses them they are loaded into the
physical memory but meanwhile they're
sitting in our storage for example on a
disk so storage is important not only to
keep data but also to extend our virtual
memory so that we think we have more
memory than we actually have for both
uses of storage we care about
performance mainly throughput and
latency throughput is how many bytes per
second can we get out of our for example
disk latency once we request a page of
data when are we going to get it back
and in storage this is improving but not
as quickly as the processor speed is
improving whereas the latency is
improving but very slowly the reduction
in storage latency is even slower than
the reduction in DRAM latency so
processor are getting faster and faster
drm is getting faster but lagging behind
processors in becoming slower and slower
relative to the processors and that
storage is falling further behind
theorem itself in addition to
performance we are also really concerned
with reliability if our processor fails
our system temporarily doesn't work
until we replace the processor but then
we can boot up the system and it works
again but if our disk fails we lose our
programs data settings etc which is much
much worse than just a processor failing
so we are much more worried about the
reliability of our storage then we are
about most of the other elements of our
computer system and finally the
types of storage that we can use are
very diverse we can have magnetic disks
are traditional hard drives optical
disks such as CDs and DVDs tape for
backup flash drives that are much faster
than most of the other ones and so on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
