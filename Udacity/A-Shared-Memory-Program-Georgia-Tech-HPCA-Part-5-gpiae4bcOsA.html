version of the same program we still
have the same size of the overall array
and the same number of processor cores
but this time they can all access the
same memory so we can just put the whole
array in memory we will have the total
sum and each of them will be computing
its own some so because this arrays in
the shared memory each processor will
sum up its own part of the array the big
difference occurs not only here where we
are actually able to just access the
part of the array we want but also in
how we can compute the Sun instead of
having to explicitly send the elements
of the array to one of the course here
each core can access the awesome
variable to compute the final sum so
what they do is they synchronize so they
have a critical section around this and
then each core simply takes the overall
system and adds its own some into it and
then freeze the log so that the next
score can do it so the course can do
this in any order they want we don't
have to control that order or anything
all that needs to happen is that all of
them have added the sum together and now
we still have to make sure that one of
the cores prints out the sum but because
this can be done in any order core 0
could be the one that does this first
and then prints out only it's part of
the Sun because the others have not
updated this yet so we need to add code
here to have a what's called a barrier
where basically we put a synchronization
here that makes all of the course wait
for everybody to arrive before they
proceed to ensure that core 0 when it
does this does it only when everybody
else has arrived to this point and has
incremented the sum already one of the
nice properties of this is not only that
it makes it more explicit who does what
so that we don't have to think about
this as being basically four different
versions of code there is no need to
distribute the array the whole array is
all the time in the shared memory we
just choose who's going to access what</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
