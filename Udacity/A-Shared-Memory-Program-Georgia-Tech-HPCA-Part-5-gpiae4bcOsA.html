version of the same program we still
have the same size of the overall array
and the same number of processor cores
but this time they can all access the
same memory so we can just put the whole
array in memory we will have the total
sum and each of them will be computing
its own sum so because this arrays in
the shared memory each processor will
sum up its own part of the array the big
difference
occurs not only here where we are
actually able to just access the part of
the array we want but also in how we can
compute the sum instead of having to
explicitly send the elements of the
array to one of the cores here each core
can access the awesome variable to
compute the final sum so what they do is
they synchronize so they have a critical
section around this and then each core
simply takes the overall sum and adds
its own sum into it and then frees the
lock so that the next core can do it so
the course can do this in any order they
want we don't have to control that order
or anything all that needs to happen is
that all of them have added the sum
together and now we still have to make
sure that one of the cores prints out
the sum but because this can be done in
any order core 0 could be the one that
does this first and then prints out only
its part of the sum because the others
has not updated this yet so we need to
add code here to have a what's called a
barrier where basically we put a
synchronization here that makes all of
the cores wait for everybody to arrive
before they proceed to ensure that core
0 when it does this does it only when
everybody else has arrived to this point
and has incremented the sum already one
of the nice properties of this is not
only that it makes it more explicit who
does what so that we don't have to think
about this as being basically four
different versions of code there is no
need to distribute the array the whole
array is all the time in the shared
memory we just choose who's going to
access what</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
