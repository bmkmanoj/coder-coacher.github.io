instead of subtracting this quantity 3w
plus 12 n we wanted to add it that would
effectively be the same as for example
grant getting another three orders for
wiper blades and another 12 orders for
nozzles so we would be adding new orders
to the original number of orders that he
had and therefore he would make more
money in the end we know that some of
that money would come from the wiper
blade orders and some of it would also
come from the nozzles so we'd want to
add both of those quantities to the
original expression so that means that
both of the terms 3w and 12 n should be
positive so the answer is 3w plus 12 n
so you can see the difference here
between having a negative sign or a
minus sign in front of something inside
parentheses for setting a plus sign in
front of something inside parentheses
the minus sign up here ends up applying
to both terms that were inside the
parentheses but down here we didn't
actually change the sign of either term
that's in the parentheses keep this in
mind as we move forward</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
