you may be familiar with the language of
regular expressions you've seen them if
you've taken CS 101 maybe you've seen
them elsewhere in any event we'll give
an overview of them there's a language
for regular expressions they can be
expressed as strings so for example the
string a star B star C star describes a
language and that language consists of
any number of a's followed by any number
of B's followed by any number of C's so
elements of this language include the
strings ABC a a b c c stars can be any
number so it could be 0 of them so say
just B would be an example the empty
string all by itself would be an example
ccccc would be an example and so on now
there's a whole language of symbols like
plus and question mark and so on for
regular expressions and to make sense of
them we have to be able to describe what
are the possible grammars and then what
are the possible languages that those
grammars correspond to so grammar is a
description of a language and a language
is a set of strings now this form of
description of the grammar is a long
sequence of characters it's convenient
when you're quickly typing something in
but it can be difficult to work with RAM
or expressions get long and so we're
going to describe the possible grammars
in a format that's more compositional in
other words but I'm going to describe is
an API which stands for application
programming interface this is the
interface that a programmer uses rather
than the UI or user interface that a
user uses when you click with your mouse
and so we'll describe a series of
function calls that can be used to
describe the grammar of a regular
expression we'll say that a regular
expression can be built up by these
types of calls first a literal of some
string s so for example if we say
literal of a then that describes the
language consisting of just the
character string a and nothing else we
have the API
call sequence of x and y so we could say
sequence of literal a literal be and
that would consist of just the language
just the string a B so far not very
interesting then we could say
alternatives XY so similarly alternative
of the same thing say literal a literal
B and that would consist of two
possibilities either the string a or the
string B will use the standard notation
for the name of our API call here and
star of X stands for any number of
repetitions zero or more so star of
literal a would be the empty string or a
or a a and so on we can say one of and
then string of possible characters and
that's the same as the alternative of
all the individual characters so one of
a B C matches A or B or C it's a
constrained version of the alt function
will use the symbol gol standing for end
of line to match only the end of a
character string and nowhere else so
what it matches is the empty string but
it matches only at the end so the only
example we can give is end of line
itself and we can give an example of
sequence little a end of line and that
matches exactly an A and nothing else at
the end and then we'll add dot which
matches any possible character a b c any
other character in the alphabet</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
