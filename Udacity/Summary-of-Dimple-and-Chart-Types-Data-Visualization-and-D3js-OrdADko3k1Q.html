lesson and remind you of the iterative
process of sketching of visualization we
started with our bar chart notice that
while it does some things well such as
highlight when games were not held it
doesn't really convey the trend in time
that well and also looks a bit strange
since the bars are so thin since they
represent only one year we then went to
a scatter plot which shows the trend a
little bit better as we can follow the
circles as they rise and fall captures
the missing years in which a game was
not held but not nearly as well as the
bar chart but is typically used to
represent things where the values on the
x-axis aren't necessarily correlated or
ordered all the scatter plot has some of
the benefits of the bar chart and some
of the benefits of a line plot it does a
bit of a mediocre job at both we then
try to iterate with a line plot since it
is most suited for time series data and
conveys trends very well here we can
easily see the trend in attendances over
the history of the world cup but tends
to obscure dates where there was no data
or a game was not held so to remedy this
we're going to add our scatter dots back
in to show that because of World War two
there were no world cup games held and
then to make the data points in this
case the circles more striking we can
style them with CSS to make them read
and to add context we added a title I
kept the title in here the whole time
through their duration since it's
usually a good practice to start with
both a title and labels on your axes so
they even though the visual display of
your data may not be the perfect ideal
you or reader still as a sense of what
data you're looking at and that
concludes the dimpled reyes live coding
example i wanted to go through and
hopefully of a better sense of the
process involved with reaching a final
