semantic information about user input
widgets structures and behavior to allow
assistive technologies to convey
appropriate information to people with
disabilities so far we've looked at how
to make a web app accessible using a
sensible Dom order which helps you
create a logical focus strategy which
lays the groundwork for a rich keyboard
experience both through the use of
built-in keyboard interactions and
sophisticated custom keyboard event
handling using native elements for
optimal keyboard usability also gives us
the built in semantics used by assistive
technology to present a customized
interface but we also need to think
about labeling controls and images and
being sure to add page structure using
headings and other semantic HTML
elements to provide landmark information
for assistive technology and finally the
importance of links in creating a rich
interactive experience in a complex site
HTML comes with support for all of those
things built in and that gets us a
really long way but sometimes it just
doesn't quite go far enough for example
so far there's no standardized HTML
element for a drop-down menu which is a
pretty commonly used UI metaphor and
there are some more subtle semantics
like the user needs to know about this
as soon as possible so in this lesson
we're going to learn how we can express
semantics which HTML can't express on
its own</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
