of these platforms offer Google cast
provides a simple sender receiver
topology which allows developers to
create multi device experiences
integrated with their existing apps on
Android iOS and the web Android TV
simply takes Android and brings it into
the living room this makes it ideal for
extending your existing Android app to
work in the living room whether or not
the user has their phone on them you can
integrate your service or app with
Google cast Android TV or even better
both where to start and how to go
further depends on the type of service
and what platforms are already
integrated in many case you can then
extend to cover multiple platforms for
the greatest impact and best user
experience regardless of what the user
has driving their TV the most common use
case I hear talked about is streaming
media and whether your app is on Android
iOS or web your first step in building
for the living room is adding in Google
cast functionality now this will ensure
your users will be able to stream on all
Google cast ready devices including
chromecast and Android TV once you've
finished adding Google cast support you
can then extend your Android app using
the Leanback library allowing your users
to launch and control the app from their
Android TV beyond this common use case
it really depends what platform you're
already working on and therefore the
platform from which you're extending if
you've already got an Android app it can
most easily be extended with the
Leanback library to work on Android TV
in fact many Android apps for the phone
tablet and TV will all be bundled in the
same app package which simplifies the
Google Play experience for users in
essence the TV is just another form
factor for your app if you've got a web
app it can most easily be extended to
the living room by using the Google cast
platform the chrome API takes care of
rendering the app and then streaming
that content to the cast device if
you've already got an iOS app it can
also easily be extended to the living
room
by using the Google cast SDK for iOS</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
