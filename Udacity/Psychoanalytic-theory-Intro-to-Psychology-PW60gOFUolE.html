we're going to discuss is psychoanalytic
theory which was created by Sigmund
Freud and Freud made at least four major
assumptions in explaining personality
the first assumption he made was about
the power of the unconscious and that is
the unconscious mind is much more
important in shaping our personality
than the conscious mind and in fact the
metaphor that he used is of the iceberg
and the tip of the iceberg is
consciousness it's just a small little
part of who we are what's really
important is below the surface and
that's the unconscious mind so the
second major assumption that Sigmund
Freud made was that the human mind has
three provinces so the first province of
mind is what Sigmund Freud called the in
and that's the seat of our impulses our
desires pleasure oriented it's all about
what the second province of mind was
what he called the ego and the ego is
our sense of self and it's realistic and
finally we have the super-ego and that
is the sense of control of our impulses
conscience knowing right from wrong so
it makes these three provinces so
interesting is that there's a conflict
inherent conflict between the it on the
one hand and the super-ego on the other
between impulse wanting something and
controlling that impulse in fact we
often can depict this as a fight that we
have ourselves between our angels side
and our devil side the devil tells us to
do it we want it the angel says no so
the third assumption that Sigmund Freud
made is that personality is shaped by
early childhood experiences now this may
not seem so radical to us but understand
that in the day people did not make that
assumption they assume childhood
experiences really didn't matter much
Freud argued otherwise so the last major
assumption that Freud made and one of
his big contributions was the idea of
defense mechanisms and defense
mechanisms are like our immune system
but for our mind they keep threatening I
ideas and thoughts and motives out of
consciousness so to the better known
defense mechanisms that Freud talked
about where repression and reaction
formation and in repression were keeping
these threatening ideas and thoughts and
feelings out of consciousness and the
main thoughts and feelings and impulses
that we repress are sexual and
aggressive impulses so with reaction
formation we turn a threatening impulse
into its exact opposite so for instance
a parent who might Harbor unconscious
feelings of hostility towards a child
but those feelings are too threatening
so they turn it into its opposite and
become smothering with affection
likewise another example might be
homophobia when someone is threatened by
their own latent homosexual impulses and
turns that impulse into hostility
towards those who express homosexual
behavior</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
