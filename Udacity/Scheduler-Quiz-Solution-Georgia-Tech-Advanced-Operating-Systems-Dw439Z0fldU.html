choices that I give you you are not
completely off base let me just talk
through each of these choices and why it
may be a perfectly valid choice with a
scheduler in picking the next threat to
run on the processor first-come
first-serve says well you know there is
a an order of arrival into the processor
there's a fairness issue I'm going to
pick the one that became runnable at the
earliest so that is the first come first
serve policies are married in that the
second is well somebody paid a lot of
money to run the program and so I'm
going to give a priority that is
statically assigned with every process
or a thread and i'm going to pick the
one that has the highest priority so
that's also a valid choice the third
possibility is a threads priority is not
static it may be born with a certain
priority but over time it might change
why it might it might the threads
priority change over time well for one
thing operating systems typically tend
to give priority to jobs or processes or
threads whatever you may want to call
them that tend to be interactive that
tend to take a short amount of time on
the cpu and and then go off and do i or
synchronization those kinds of threads
are shortest amount of time that it
takes on the processor the scheduler may
want to boost up the priority of the
process and give it a higher priority
even if it was born with a smaller
static priority and that may be a reason
why it might choose a higher dynamic
priority that's a third choice and the
food choices pick the one whose memory
contents in the CPU cache is likely to
be the highest what that means is that
the thread that has the cash warm for
its working set is likely to do really
well when it gets get scheduled on the
processor and so it makes sense to
suggest that this might be a good choice
as well so all of these four choices one
can argue for and for and against but in
this particular lecture what we're going
to think about is particularly look at
this last choice and that is picking the
thread whose memory contents are likely
to be in the CPU
speaking that as a choice why that makes
a lot of sense especially in a
multiprocessor where there's going to be
several levels of caches and coherence
mrs. and so on and so forth we'll
discuss more about that in the rest of
this lecture but I wanted to warm you up
with this particular quiz in which we
have all these different choices and one
can as I said argue for or against every
one of these choices and there are valid
arguments both for and against but this
is the choice that we're going to focus
on for the rest of this lecture</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
