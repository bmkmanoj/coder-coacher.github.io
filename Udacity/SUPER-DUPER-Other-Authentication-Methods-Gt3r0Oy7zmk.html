something you know something you have
those are called factors the first one
is sort of the secret you know factor
the second is something you have factor
the third is you know who you r factor
so it doesn't have to be just one factor
you can actually have a multi-factor
authentication you know one of the quiz
questions the smartphone and pin for
example the password and and the pin
that is sent or the the code that is
sent to you the password is something
you know the pin that is sent to you in
the smartphone is based on the
smartphone which is something you have
for example so you can use more than one
factor to actually make authentication
stronger so as if we said we use more
than one method you type password would
also send code via SMS and this code
goes to your phone actually gmail when
you create an account uses this these
are called phone verified accounts or
TVA's mainly to provide protection
against bots that create a lot of his
accounts so this is multi factor because
it's not just a password but also this
code that comes to a device that you
have so that's the second factor your
ATM card and pin that you use to get
money out of you an ATM machine is
actually a two-factor the pin is
something you know the card itself is
something you have so these are two
factors that another example of a
multi-factor authentication the other
methods that use things like you know
where you are your location the IP
address of your machine OS fingerprint
it sort of add a little bit more to the
authentication process so when you have
multi-factor authentication of course
that hacker must defeat both to
successfully compromised the
authentication method we have in place
because so there authentication we
talked about sort of going to the system
having a trusted path to the system
providing the password fortunately a lot
of times you do authentication over the
network where the system may be
thousands of miles away from you in
factories we access whether it's our
email or our banking system and so on
are of course we don't walk up to them
so what happens in this case we don't
have a trusted path to the system to
which we are giving remember we had
physical wires from you
keyboard to your machine right in front
of you in close proximity that's how you
get the trusted path a network is open
and you obviously the same thing doesn't
hold there so we don't have a trusted
path especially when we accessing remote
services so network authentication
introduces a new problem now how do you
deal with the absence of this trusted
path that we've been talking about well
actually we need crypto to secure the
network communication so when you talk
about network security in a different
lesson we're going to address this
course have to worry about different
kind of threats such as man in the
middle and things like that but the
reason I wanted to mention although we
going to cover this in network security
topic is that authentication relies on
this fundamental requirement is
distrusted path in a network you're not
going to have that so you'll have to do
something else about the lack of the
trusted path or some method you have to
find to secure the network over which
you're going to send the evidence for
authenticating yourself</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
