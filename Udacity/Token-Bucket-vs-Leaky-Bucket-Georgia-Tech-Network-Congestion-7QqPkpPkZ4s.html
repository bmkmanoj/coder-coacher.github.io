token bucket and a leaky bucket a token
bucket permits traffic to be bursty but
it bounds it by the rate ro on the other
hand a leaky bucket simply forces the
bursty traffic to be smoothed the bound
in a token bucket is as follows if our
bucket size is beta then we know that in
any interval T then the rate is always
less than beta that is the maximum
number of tokens that can be accumulated
in the bucket plus the rate at which
tokens accumulate times that time
interval we also know that the long-term
rate will always be less than a row
token buckets have no discard or
priority policies whereas leaky buckets
typically implement priority policies
for flows that exceed the smoothing rate
both are relatively easy to implement
but the token bucket is a little bit
more flexible since it has some
additional parameters that we can use to
configure birth size one of the
limitations of token buckets is the fact
that in any traffic interval of length T
the flow can send beta plus T times row
tokens of data if a network tries to
police the flows by simply measuring
their traffic over intervals of length T
the flow can cheat by sending this
amount of data in each interval consider
for example an interval of twice this
length well if the flow can send beta
plus T times Rho in each interval then
over 2t the flow can consume two times
beta plus tau times row tokens but
actually this is greater than how much
the flow is actually supposed to be able
to send which is beta plus two T times
Rho so policing traffic being sent by
token buckets is actually rather
difficult so token buckets allow for
long bursts and if the bursts are of
high priority traffic they are difficult
to police and may interfere with other
high priority traffic so there's some
need to limit how long a token bucket
sender can monopolize the network</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
