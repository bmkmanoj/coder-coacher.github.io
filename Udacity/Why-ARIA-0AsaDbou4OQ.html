native elements because they give you
focus keyboard support and built-in
semantics essentially for free but there
are instances when native HTML won't cut
it the web accessibility initiatives
accessible rich Internet applications
spec is good for bridging areas where
there are accessibility issues that
can't be managed with native HTML I
don't have time to keep saying the web
accessibility initiatives accessible
rich Internet application specification
so for the rest of the course will be
calling it by its much friendly and
nickname REO though you'll often see it
referred to as why aria as well which is
helpful if you want to search for it
Aria works by allowing you to specify
attributes on elements which modify the
way that element is translated into the
accessibility tree let's take a look at
a really basic example to show you how
this works if we create a plain checkbox
we saw in less than three that a screen
reader will announce it as a checkbox
tell you its label if it has one and
tell you whether it is checked on up and
similarly users of other assistive
technologies like voice control will be
able to operate it however what happens
if for some reason we decide we really
need to re-implement a basic checkbox
well for a start we know from listen to
that we need to make it focusable and
handle the same keyboard interactions as
a native checkbox but what happens if we
then try to use it with a screen reader
the screen reader gives us no indication
that the element is meant to be a
checkbox sighted users can see the
visual cues which indicate the checkbox
pattern but nothing is announced to
screen reader users using Aria allows us
to tell the screen unit that extra
information to give you an idea how it
works let's look at this toy fake check
box example just to clarify there's very
little reason you'd ever want to write
code like this you're usually much
better off styling a regular check box
but this gives us a taste of what Aria
allows us to do so i'll run probox light
on this page to show what things are
like before we do anything tim tams
mental Isis we ever checked and
unchecked custom checkbox up here
chromevox reads out the labels tim tams
and mint slices but doesn't give us any
indication that either one is a checkbox
if we compare that with the native
checkbox
checkbox checked men slices checkbox not
checked chromevox reads out the label
the role and the checked state of each
and plays a small air con which is that
small sound effect you might have heard
at the start to give a quick indication
of the role and checked state as well so
I'm going to pop open dev tools and add
an aria role of checkbox and an aria
checked state to each of those custom
checkboxes so the first one gets an aria
checked state of true and the second one
will get an aria checked state of false
note that I need to explicitly specify
that aria checked is true or false just
adding the attribute with an empty
string like we often do with other HTML
attributes won't do the job Aria
attributes always need to have explicit
values so now I'm going to close
devtools the startup chromevox lied
again tim tams checkbox checked commend
slices checkbox not checked Tim Tams
checkbox checked so now we can hear that
there's really no difference from chrome
foxes point of view between the fake
check boxes and the native check boxes
they all sound identical so adding that
role attribute and that aria checked
attribute causes the node in the
accessibility tree to have the desired
role and state without changing anything
else about that nodes appearance or
behavior in terms of the accessibility
tree what Aria does is allow you to
essentially do some tree surgery we take
the accessibility tree is generated from
the plain HTML tree add Aria and get a
different accessibility tree it may be
subtly different all radically different
depending on what attributes we use and
where have all we need to keep in mind
that this is the only thing aria changes
it doesn't change anything about the
behavior of the element is added to for
example it's not going to make the
element focusable or add keyboard event
listeners we still need to do the work
by making sure we're keeping the promise
we're making by telling assistive
technology that it has that role will be
looking closer at what that means
throughout this lesson but i'll point
out right now that is no coincidence
that we're covering our ER after the
lesson on ferguson
