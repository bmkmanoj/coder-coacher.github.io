all the things that we had in the
previous shot some of these things are
percept some of the things had the
pictures internal goals let us see how
the contents of the working memory now
invoke different kinds of knowledge from
the long-term memory so let us imagine
that the procedural part of souls
long-term memory contains the following
rules the procedural knowledge and
source long-term memory is represented
in the form of rules this is sometimes
called production rules and fatigue term
production systems comes from the term
production rules so each rule here is a
production rule I have shown seven here
there could be more rules once again
these production rules are capturing the
procedural knowledge in source long term
memory recall that one of the first
things that the pitcher had to decide
was whether the pitcher should throw a
pitch or walk the batter therefore we
assume that there are some rules which
allow the pitcher to make a decision
between these two choices thus there is
a rule here if the goal is to escape and
I perceived two outs and a perceive on
the second and a perceiver runner on the
second and I perceive no runner on the
first base then I must suggest the goal
of intentionally walk batter there is
another rule the second rule says if the
goal is to escape and I perceived two
outs and I perceive a runner on the
first base or a perceived no runner in
the second or perceive no runners then
suggest ago to get the batter out we are
pitching and what might happen if I pick
the goal of intentionally walking the
batter the goal is to intentionally walk
the better then suggest intentional walk
operator
now this intentional walk I per operator
corresponds to some action available in
the world and similarly the other rules
let's consider one other rule rule
number seven if only one operator has
been selected then send the operator the
motor system and add the pitch thrown to
the state so there is now both an action
has been selected and its action is
going to be executed as well as the
state of the working memory is going
change so it will say that now the pitch
has been thrown before we go ahead let
me summarize what we just learned source
long-term memory consists of various
kinds of knowledge one kind of knowledge
the one that we are considering right
now is procedural knowledge procedural
knowledge is about how to do something
and so procedural knowledge is
represented in the form of the
production rules each production rule is
is of the form if something then
something there are n dissidents and
their consequence these n dissidents may
be connected through various kind of
relationships like and and are the
consequence two might be connected
through various kind of relationship
like and an R so I may have a if some
antecedent is true and some 1i other
entity say in dissident is true and so
on then do some consequent now that we
understand a little bit about the
representation of production rules
whatever the content what should be the
content that we put into this production
rules earlier we had said that cognitive
architecture is a goal-oriented so we
will expect goals to appear in some of
the production rules indeed they do R 1
R 2 R 3 and so on earlier we had said
that knowledge-based AI
cognitive systems use a lot of knowledge
and you can see how detailed and
specific this knowledge is in fact the
knowledge is so detailed and specific
that in principle we can hope that as
different percepts come from the world
some rule is available that will be
useful for that set of percents</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
