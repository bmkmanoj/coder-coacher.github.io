we were just running it by hand we're
imagining we're trying to find the
shortest distances from V to the other
nodes in the graph so we initialize the
distance V's distance to V as 0 then we
imagine that all the other distances to
all the other nodes in the graph are as
yet unknown and each time we go through
the loop that there's still nodes left
that haven't been completed yet we find
the node with the shortest known
distance and then we lock it down
by marking it is known and then going
through the list of its edges all the
edges out of w for example to some other
node X and we check if the new distance
the distance to W that we just locked
down plus the weight of the edge from W
to X if that improves on the best known
distance to X then we update X's
distance to be this new value and once
we've done that for all the neighbors of
W then we've finished handling W and we
go back up to this loop and say RF if
not all nodes are complete we get a new
W a new shortest distance to lock down
so that's the basic structure so let's
actually look at that in I'm going to
say Python</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
