script of going to a restaurant abstract
script or going to a restaurant this is
like a class we can instantiate it so
let's do the same script instantiated
with these values with the various
variables so Salva is now the customer
Lucas as the waiter and so on that is
instantiation is an important aspect of
intelligence let's go back to our
intelligent agent imagine as Sal was
ready a robot now how would a robot know
what to do in a restaurant how do we
program a robot in such a way that it
would know what actions who take in a
particular situation well suppose that
solve our the robot and its memory had a
number of scripts like this one and when
it entered a restaurant it invoked the
restaurant script which told it exactly
what kind of actions to take we can also
see how the script allows solved by the
robot to generate expectations to guess
what will happen even before it happens
there is one more thing worth noting
here notice how we are composing scripts
or this primitive actions either the
same primitive actions that occurred in
the last lesson so this primitive
actions are not providing the
fundamental units of frames that compose
together in some causally coherent
sequence make a script this brings up
another point notice how some knowledge
structures are composed out of other
knowledge structures earlier we had
frames for these primitive actions didem
social knowledge structures now we have
scripts which a composer of this frame
lack knowledge structures</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
