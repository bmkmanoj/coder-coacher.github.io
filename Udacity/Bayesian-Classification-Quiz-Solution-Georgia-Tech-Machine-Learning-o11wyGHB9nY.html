okay so it depends what does it depend
on I've given you everything straight
foil so okay I guess here so here's what
I'm seeing so I'm what I'm seeing is
that hypothesis one is the most likely
hypothesis it's not just the most likely
it's the most a posterior Ori well
that's what I mean by likely right it is
the map hypothesis is the maximum a
posteriori hypothesis so if we say what
is the label according to the map
hypothesis boom it's plus yes but if
we're saying what's the most likely
label so the most likely label is we
have to actually look over all the
hypotheses and in a sense let them vote
and so the probability that the label is
minus is actually 0.6 which is greater
than 0.4 so if I had to pick I would go
with - and you would be correct so I did
a little tricky thing here for you
Michael you've been complaining about my
titles because everyone said Bayesian
learning and I changed the title here at
the Bayesian classification because in
fact the problem here we've been talking
about all along is what's the best
hypothesis but here I asked you what's
the best label mm-hmm and exactly as you
point out finding the best hypothesis is
a very simple algorithm here I'll write
it for you because we did it before for
every ancient hypothesis set simply
compute the probability that it is the
best one and then simply output max
that's how you find the best hypothesis
but that's not how you find the best
label well you find the best label is
you basically do a weighted vote for
every single hypothesis in the
hypothesis set according to the weight
being the probability that hypothesis
given the data okay so the best if you
can only output hypothesis and use that
hypothesis in fact you would say plus
but if you asked everyone to vote just
like we did with boosting just like we
did effectively with Kannon and all
these other kind of weighted regression
techniques we've used before you need to
do the voting and I feel like I could
probably derive that using rules of
probability right because really what we
want if we're trying to maximize the
probability of the label given the data
and I think the probability laws would
tell us that that is equal to the sum
over all hypotheses of the hypothesis
and the label given the data which is
like the probability of the
pastas has given the data times the
probability the label given the
hypothesis and that's what we did we
summed up you know they're probably the
label given the hypothesis is either 1
or 0 that's your left column and then
we're summing up the probabilities that
correspond to the pluses and we're sum
of the probabilities corresponding to
minuses and choosing the largest one so
this is what you just said written down
as an equation basically the most likely
value is the one that maximizes this
expression and this follows directly
from Bayes rule where now instead of
trying to maximize the hypothesis given
the data you're trying to maximize as a
value given the data and I think that's
pretty straightforward to derive that
I'd like to leave it up to the students
to do it on their own ok so Michael in
some sense everything that I've told you
before is a lie and that I've led you
down this path that somehow finding the
best hypothesis is the right thing to do
but the truth is finding the value is
what we actually care about finding a
hypothesis is just a means to an end and
if we have a way of actually computing
the probabilities for all the hypotheses
then we should let them vote in order to
find the best actual label or the best
value for it
got it all right good</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
