human cognition well we can make at
least two connections immediately first
semantic networks are kind of knowledge
representation we saw how if knowledge
is represented as a semantic network and
if there is also power and
representation then you can use the
knowledge representation to address the
problem we can now say similarly for
human mind that human mind represents
problems it represents knowledge then it
uses that knowledge to address the
problem so representation then becomes
the key second and most specifically
semantic networks are related to
spreading activation networks which is a
very popular theory of human memory let
me give you an example supposing I told
you a story consisting of just two
sentences John wanted to become rich he
got a gun now notice that I did not tell
you the entire story but I'm sure you
all made up a story based on what I told
you John wanted to become rich he
decided to rob a bank he got a gun in
order to rob the bank but how did you
understand the story how did you draw
the inferences about robbing a bank
which I did not tell you anything about
imagine that you had a semantic network
that consisted of a large number of
nodes so when I gave you the first
sentence John wanted to become rich the
nodes corresponding to John and wanted
and become and rich got activated and
the excavation started spreading from
those nodes and when I said he got a gun
then the gun nerd also got activated and
that activation also started spreading
as his activation spread they merged and
a pathway court formed and all the nodes
on that pathway now become part of this
story and if you happen to have notes
like rob a bank along the pathway now
you have understanding of the story</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
