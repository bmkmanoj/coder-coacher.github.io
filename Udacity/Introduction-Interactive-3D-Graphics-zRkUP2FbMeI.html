mouse keyboard and other devices as
interactive controls for objects in a
scene we've been doing this all along
with demos such as the robot arm there's
much JavaScript code to draw upon for
getting inputs connected to programs
such as the dat GUI library for sliders
however up to this point we've had
little direct interaction with our
virtual worlds by direct interaction I
mean using the mouse to click on the
world itself and change its appearance
the main direct interaction so far has
been using the mouse to move the camera
as an example of another direct
interaction in this demo by Max Ogden
and James Halliday I'm clicking to
remove blocks or add them programs can
be seen limiting without these sorts of
direct interactions with what the user
sees even when moving around the scene
with the mouse in many demos it says if
we're a ghost we can walk through walls
or drop through the floor there's
nothing stopping us by instead
performing what's called collision
detection between objects and having the
program respond to those collisions we
can create a more believable world we
can also use physics to determine how
our actions and the movements of other
objects change what we see if you played
any computer game you know how various
button pushes and so on are tightly tied
to what you see on the screen how the
world reacts to inputs such as these is
often shown through animation techniques
of one sort or another up to this point
we've mostly been ignoring this fourth
dimension time once we start changing
elements in our scene over time we're
performing animation animations can also
be run in their own right streams flow
down a hillside people walk past you in
a marketplace the Sun sets over ocean
waves animation such as shown in this
demo by Daniel he gives us seen life in
a sense of engagement even when there is
little interaction what I'm going to
cover in this unit is a sampling of
interaction and animation techniques so
let's get going</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
