full quiz so the question was is it
better to not push anything anymore once
the wrasse is full or simply wrap around
and keep overwriting all the dresses
with new ones it turns out that the
wraparound approach is much better than
the don't push approach to see why keep
in mind that our program would look like
this have the main function execute for
a while then call some other function
these results in pushing something onto
the wrasse our high level function here
will do a lot of work occasionally
calling other functions and so on we
push to see what happens here without
running out of space let's say that our
eyes only has two entries the first
entry will be consumed by pushing the
return address when main calls do it the
second one will be consumed when we call
the function func from do it at this
point we're calling the function doulas
and it might call for example the add
function many many times so we're
getting to the place where functions are
really small and ideally we would you
know push each time and then pop when we
return and so on if we only have one
entry then really our entire rise will
be used just when we call do it and as
long as we stay in do it which might be
a very large function because it might
be doing most of the actual work in the
program all of the function calls that
we're doing really end up being
mispredicted because we ran out of red
space and the one time that we will have
a correct prediction is when we finally
return from do it if we have two entries
a similar thing will happen we will
consume the first entry by basically
pushing the first thing so pretty much
we are kind of using an entry here just
to save one misprediction at the final
return here again we are using the
second entry just to save the return
from func whenever that happens and func
itself could be calling a lot of
functions so the don't push approach
basically spending entries on kind of
long term things that need to be
remembered so that we can finally save a
misprediction once we reach the return
point from the lodge function in
contrast the wraparound approach is
gonna push this push this push this the
overwriting this entry so now what we
are doing is we're basically gonna be
correctly predicting calls to small
functions and returns and we can have
many of those in return for in
accurately predicting the final returns
from large functions because we have
many more small function calls than
large function calls in the end we are f
more effectively using the few entries
we have pretty much here we're kind of
using the entry to save a misprediction
over a very short period of time does
this entry gets utilized and then
released very quickly whereas here we're
using an entry for a long time to save a
single misprediction and in the end we
want to save as many mispredictions as
we can so that's why the wraparound
approach works better because it ends up
correctly predicting calls to small
functions many of which we can have in
return for not correctly predicting the
return from large functions to Main etc
another thing to keep in mind with the
wrasse is that it is a predictor so
either way we will be having some
mispredictions we are allowed to have
miss predictions all that will happen is
that there will be a branch
misprediction basically we will fetch
the wrong instructions and have to
recover from that so in the end the
discussion about what to do with the
wrasse has to do with achieving a larger
number of correct predictions but
neither of these two ways can actually
do things perfectly so in the end we
need to just choose which one gives us
more correct predictions and it turns
out that the wrap around approach
predicts better than the don't push
approach while both of them result in
miss predictions anyway</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
