filter on the sensor so in essence a
bear filter is nothing else but
different types of color filters there
are above the photo diodes and most of
the time you will actually see a two
greens and a blue and a red so this
would be the four region here that
represents one pixel for another here
that presents another pixel for here and
so on of course depending on the
convention of the bear filter use
sometimes you might have two Reds and
green and a blue and also two blues in a
green and a red it depends again on it
but knowing exactly what is the bear
filter is essential because we need to
know this to how to compute and then
come up with the final image basically
what happens with a bear filter is each
one of them let's only a specific light
through so when the light has hitting
the red basically the blue and green are
prevented from going through red goes
through same thing with green yes the
green goes through same thing with blue
only the blue goes through so in essence
we create three different patterns of
course the photo diodes then store the
intensity for each and every one of them
but this coding scheme pretty much lets
us know which one of the bins is
actually blue green or red then of
course it's the combination of these
three channels that gives us the final
image and this is the one that we need
to then decode and save for our final
things one of the questions that's
important is how is the raw input in a
bear mosaic format convert it to an
image what's the process to be able to
then get basically the RGB color values
that is the RGB as we've discussed when
we talked about the image processing
pipeline and the three channels separate
it out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
