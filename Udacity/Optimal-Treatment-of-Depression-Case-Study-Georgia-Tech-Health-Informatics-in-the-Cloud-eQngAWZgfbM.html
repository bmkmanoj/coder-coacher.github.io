applications of analytics to the
determination of optimal treatment that
often now means the best results at the
lowest cost these are of course not
precisely define terms and there is a
serious debate about issues such as the
value of spending substantial sums on
treatments that only prolong the life of
terminal patients by small increments in
time the research shown here illustrates
the potential to help with less
controversial clinical contexts a
partially observable markov decision
process a variation that introduces
memory was developed and compared to the
actual treatment of nearly 6,000
depressed patients abstracted from their
electronic records I leave it to you to
read this section in the text for the
details but as shown here under certain
assumptions the model delivered
improvements that we're better than or
almost as good as real physicians but at
a better cost per unit of improvement as
we seek to re-engineer the health care
system technologies like this may become
a routine part of clinical decision
support some would even speculate that
at least in certain circumstances they
may replace physicians but I leave it to
you to consider that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
