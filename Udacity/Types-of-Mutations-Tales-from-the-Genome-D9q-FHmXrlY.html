right through this if you had some
slight understanding of these terms over
here now if we compare this first
sequence to the original up here we see
the only difference is a one-letter
change right here that means that this
is going to be a single nucleotide
change the second sequence actually
looks the same as the original except
that it's missing a CA right here so
there's been a deletion the next one has
actually had an insertion added in so
that would be number 2 this fourth one
notice there was a tac and then it got
repeated and repeated again this is what
we call a trinucleotide repeat we had
three in a row and then this last one
turned out to be a complete duplication
into n the sequence was just duplicated
over so that would be number three</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
