the friends quest at least for this
lesson it's possible right now for Jon
to have TJ as a friend and TJ not to
have John back let's write a method
remove medan friends that removes all of
the friends that don't like John back so
for example if John has friends TJ Maria
jamesha and Joe let's say jamesha and
Joe both like John back but TJ and Maria
don't so we want to remove TJ and Maria
from John's friends list so in this case
we'll start with TJ at index zero so
we'll remove TJ from the list now the
list gets reindex to look at the next
person in the list we need to look at
the zeroth person again so we can't just
have a counter variable that we
increment by 1 each time we look at
Maria and Maria also doesn't like John
so we'll remove Maria and the rest of
the list will get reindex tagen so yet
again to look at the next person we have
to look at the zeroth person we look at
jamesha and jamesha likes John so she
should stay in the list will increment
the counter and look at the next person
Joe likes John so we'll keep Joe in the
list so we should increment the counter
variable and look at the next person
which would be at index 2 but to is no
longer a valid index even though it was
originally so we're done</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
