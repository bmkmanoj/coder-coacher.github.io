actually solve Ravens progressive
matrices we've talked about this a
little bit already but take it a little
bit further and talk about how you would
actually implement the problem-solving
approach you've seen today we talked
about a couple different ways of going
about it we talked about generating
multiple answers and testing them
against the answer options or generating
one answer and testing it more
intelligently against the different
options available to you so talk about
which one you would do and how you would
actually implement it in doing so make
sure to think of three by three problems
as well with more transformations and
more figures going on it can be a lot
more difficult to figure out what to
generate and the problem space can
explode very quickly also make sure to
think about how you're actually going to
infer the mapping between different
figures in the problem how do you know
which shape in one frame maps up in a
different shape in another frame and
then talk about how you would then use
that information to generate what you
think the answer is</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
