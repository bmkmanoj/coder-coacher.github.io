Bay Area California Bay Area and i have
read Marion color blindness okay so
red-green color blindness we you know
just sort of heard about that for the
first time and the course and we're
learning a bit more about the
inheritance patterns what is red wing
colorblindness what does it mean to be
red green colorblind well to me what it
means is that I often mix up colors that
have read in them and so in particular I
mix up reds and browns and sometimes
browns and greens because I'm not seeing
the red correctly in those sometimes it
can even show up in the form of blues
and purples I'm sort of seeing them all
is about the same and in fact you know
they may look different to other people
when did you first know that you had
red-green color blindness you know I
don't really remember it was when I was
a really young child my uncle had been
red-green colorblind and then actually
my mom's uncle as well so I think I
inherited it from her side and so when I
was a little kid she recognized that I
might be colorblind or add this
propensity and so she had me tested of
you know one of the eye doctors with
looking at the the little bubble charts
with colors that you may remember having
taken at some point so you were very
young when when your I guess your mother
found this out that's right and did it
um I mean it was it up did it cause any
issue me it was like okay we knew this
was a possibility and now what kind of
if anything was there to do at that
point not really much you know as I say
her brother and uncle had had it and so
she was sort of aware of it and you know
it's it's useful to know that you see
the world in different colors than
everybody else just so you can be
prepared and you know obviously that's
something I just did my where of today
too so that I I don't say you know this
is definitely purple to people if they
if I realize I go it might actually be
blue and you know others are seeing it
is blue how do people respond to this
particular trade of bright green color
blindness um I would say that you know
probably about half of people that I
interact with already know somebody
closely who is reading color blind so
it's no news to them and they'll just
say oh yeah my brother is also or
something of that nature and then the
other half it's like a great party trick
and so the first time they hear that
your red green colorblind what they want
to do is walk around the room going well
colors this what colors that's what
color
you know which is fun for about 30
seconds Alan be kind of ready to move on
but that's been my general experience
over the years</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
