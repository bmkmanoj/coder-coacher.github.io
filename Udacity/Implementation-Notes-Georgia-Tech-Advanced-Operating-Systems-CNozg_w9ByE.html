implementation is log maintenance the
transaction managers write the log
records for recovering the persistent
state they are written into log records
that are in memory data structure of the
transaction manager and every so often
the transaction managers do a log force
of the in-memory log segment to the
storage for persistence and the
frequency of log force impacts
performance of course because they are
synchronous i/o operations and log force
can also be initiated by an application
if it is concerned about its persistent
state getting on to storage but in
Quicksilver an app has to be very
careful about how often they do a log
force because log maintenance is done by
the transaction manager at a site for
all of the processes that are running at
that node and so the log record in
Quicksilver actually contains all the
modifications to persistent state
required by all the processes that are
running in this node and therefore if an
individual client at a node decides to
do a log force is actually impacting the
performance of not only that particular
client but all the other clients as well
therefore services have to be very
careful about choosing the mechanisms
that is available in operating system
commensurate with their recovery
requirements</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
