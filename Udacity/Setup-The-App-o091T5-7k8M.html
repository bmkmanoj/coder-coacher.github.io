application with a blank activity
Android studio will take you to the
activity designer and as you can see
here it's populated with a very basic
hello world text field I'm going to
paste in the UI declaration for the
activity recognition app and you'll see
the code for this in the instructor
notes below the video so I'll just
replace all of this with my code and my
code as you saw had the two buttons for
requesting activity update for removing
activity update and then this text view
which just had the details of the
activities now you'll see that there are
some errors this is because I don't have
any string set up these are values that
you specify using XML files keeping them
separate from the UI declaration this is
good practice to this point in the
course I've been hard coding them but
that's not a best practice I'm not going
to go into detail on explaining them now
check out the Android fundamentals
courses or the documentation for how
they work it's pretty straightforward
and once you've done it a few times it
becomes second nature I'm just going to
paste in these string values and you can
get the code from the instructor notes
strings are in res values strings.xml
you can see there isn't much in here and
i'm going to paste the new stuff in so
now I've pasted in all the different
string resources that I'm going to be
using in this application and if I go
back to my layout file will see that the
red has gone away that those errors are
now fixed next as you've done before
you'll need to update your build.gradle
to use the services libraries filled out
Gradle can be found in your Gradle
scripts and that's the one for the
module app and you can see it here I'm
just going to paste in my Play services
version do remember that when you're
building this to check the version of
the library I'm just using six dot five
dot plus here if you have a later
version of the library use that and also
try to use the specific latest version
of the library you have on your machine
as we demonstrated earlier for the
purpose of keeping things simple and
putting the plus in here but that's bad
practice also the name may change just
look out in the documentation at the
moment it's called com google dat
android GMS call on Play services but
this name may change over time so just
keep an eye out for that once you've
done with that you then also need to
update the app manifest
the first thing that you're going to add
to the app manifest our details on the
services libraries that you're going to
use you enter these just above the
closing application tag and I'm just
going to paste mine in you see right now
it has red indicating an error but when
i do my next grade i'll think that will
go away you don't need to worry about
that and then the final thing that you
need to add to your app manifest is the
ability to use the activity recognition
API s and you do this whether users
permission tag so I'm just going to go
to the underneath my application tag and
i'll paste in the users permission so
you can see i'm just setting it to users
permission and the android name is the
activity recognition details so now my
manifest is set up my build our Gradle
is set up so I've done everything I need
for my project to work for activity
recognition so now all we have to do is
actually write the project</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
