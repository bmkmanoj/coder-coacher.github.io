measuring smiles was an objective
measure that is it's something that we
can actually see and measure however we
could have also asked the fellow you
dashians to rate their level of
happiness when I gave them a high-five
in asking them to rate their happiness
we use a self-report measure and this is
a subjective measure now I would have
Susan here give you a few more examples
of different objective and subjective
measures another type of objective
measure is a physiological response
heart rate is one example of a
physiological response sweating is
another physiological measure
physiological measures are also
objective because we can quantify those
responses for the heart rate we can use
pulse to determine heart rate sweating
we can measure temperature and we can
also measure the galvanic skin response
one problem with self-report measures is
that we can't be sure those are
completely accurate but that is the only
way we can get that information is to
ask the participant think back to
Lauren's reaction to tickles the snake
we could use different psychological
measures to assess her response we can
use an objective measure meaning we
could watch her run away we could also
look at her nervous laughter and that
would be an objective measure we could
also ask self-report hey Lauren how did
you feel when you first saw that snake a
physiological objective measure we could
have measured her heart rate which would
have increased due to her fear response
we could have also measured her sweating
most psychological experiments try to
get both objective and subjective
measures</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
