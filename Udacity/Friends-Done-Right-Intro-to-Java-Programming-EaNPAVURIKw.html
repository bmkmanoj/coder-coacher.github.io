ArrayList it's time to revisit an old
friend the person class I removed some
of the methods and added one new one get
friend gets the eye friend but as you
can see it's a pretty ugly method this
is bad code I wasn't careful when I
wrote it and it's messy it would work
alright if my friends are named Madonna
staying and share but most people have
spaces in their names maybe I could fix
this by separating the names with commas
or semicolons I could change the
separator here but that won't really fix
the underlying problem the underlying
problem is that reality has structure
and we need to choose the right data
types to model that structure in our
case we have multiple individual people
a string of names isn't the right way to
save a bunch of individuals who all play
a similar role an ArrayList would be
much better for this saving an ArrayList
of person objects instead of just a
string of friends would allow us to do a
lot of cool things for example we could
add a string nationality to each person
and then you could get a list of all the
countries your friends are from but
let's work our way up to problems like
that first let's store the friends in an
ArrayList of strings without changing
the observable behavior in software
engineering this would be called
refactoring refactoring is when you
reorganize code the implementation
changes the observable behavior does not
change often we do this to make it
easier to add new features now I want
you to refactor the person class I'll
give you some tests so you can make sure
nothing breaks in the process you'll
need to update the instance variables
save the friends names in an ArrayList
of strings you'll need to update add
friend get friend and get friends will
skip unfriend for the moment but we'll
come back to it later and I'm gonna give
you a hint do you remember the to string
method from lesson 2 to string returns a
representation of the object and works
pretty well for array lists of strings
let me show you what it does if I create
an ArrayList stirrers and add a couple
of strings to it like this and then I
call the two string method the two
string method returns a string that has
the values separated by commas and
spaces and then surrounded by brackets
this is pretty close to what you want
for the getfriends method for the
getfriends method you just want the
values separated by commas and spaces
and here's one last
if you get an error that Java doesn't
know what an ArrayList is you might need
to import it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
