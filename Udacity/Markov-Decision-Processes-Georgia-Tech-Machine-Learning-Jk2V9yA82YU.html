going to be using through most of the
discussions that we'll be having at
least on a reinforcement learning at
least single-agent reinforcement
learning and it's called the Markov
decision process this should sound
familiar to you Michael
well you did say we're going to talk
about decisions that's true and we need
a process for making decisions and we're
going to introduce something called the
Markovian property as a part of this
discussion and I'll tell you exactly
what that means at a moment so I'm just
going to write out this framework and
just and tell you what it is and what
the problem it produces for us and then
we're going to start talking about
solutions through the rest of the
discussion so a Markov decision process
tries to capture worlds like this one by
dividing up in the following way we say
that there are States and states are a
set of tokens that somehow represent
every state for lack of a better word
that one could be in so does that make
sense to you Michael yeah I think so
okay so what would the states be in the
world that we've been playing around in
so far so the only thing that differs
from moment to moment is where I guess I
am
which grid grid position I'm in so I
feel like each different grid position I
could be in is a state
maybe there's a state for being
successfully done or unsuccessfully done
that's possible but let's stick with a
simple one I like that one because
that's really I think easy to grasp so
there are at least of all the states one
could reach there's well let's see
there's four times three minus one since
you can never reach the state although
we could say it is a state we just
happen to never reach it so at most if
we just think of this grid literally as
a grid there are something like twelve
different states and we can represent
these states as their XY coordinates say
we can call this the start state as say
1 comma 1 which is sort of how I
described it earlier we could describe
the goal state as 4 comma 4 and say this
is how we describe our state's or
frankly it doesn't matter we could call
these states 1 2 3 up to 12 or we can
name them Fred and Markus it doesn't
really matter the point is that they're
States they represent something and we
have some way of knowing which state we
happen to be
okay sure okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
