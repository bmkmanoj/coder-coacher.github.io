computer systems we get things done by
running software that we write or
somebody else is written for us and
we're gonna talk about exactly what are
those bugs that actually turn into
vulnerabilities we're also going to talk
about how exactly those bugs or errors
get exploited so the vulnerabilities
that we're going to talk about come
because of memory overflow if in mind
memory overflow means that the amount of
memory we have for a certain data type
is not sufficient so the data type runs
over allocate space and an attacker is
actually able to exploit a program by
inserting new code sometimes in certain
part of memory and also then directing
or transferring control of that code to
the instructions that attacker has
introduced in this memory that we are
talking about stack is the area where we
allocate space for dynamically created
data items or variables so the most
common example of any user stack is when
you make a function call or a procedure
call when we do that the variables that
we need to execute the function code get
allocated on the stack so as you make
function calls your procedure calls for
each call we create what we call a stack
frame on the stack this stack frame
essentially you can think about gives us
the scratchpad or the memory that we're
going to need for the execution of this
function it's created when the function
is called and it is discarded when the
function finishes and returns so what
exactly is stored in the stack frame
part of this we're going to allocate
space for local variables that are going
to be used by the code defined by the
function also parameters that we're
going to pass this is data that we're
going to pass to pass to the function
those arguments a parameter is going to
be stored in the stack frame and we also
store control information so remember
when you call a function you are doing
control transfer from where you were to
where this function code is when you get
done with the function you have to
return to the point from where you had
made the
call and the vulnerability that we're
going to explore today which is buffer
overflow back buffer overflows is
actually going to manipulate the memory
that is in this frame before we actually
get into the details I should mention
that these software vulnerabilities that
we have an attacker is allowed to call a
program that you run on your system the
program may have an interface that
allows legitimate users who make calls
to it and when they make those calls
they are actually going to pass some
data so the entry point here is actually
a legitimate call that could be made by
users of this program they've had
certain kind of data and the attacker is
going to pass data that is not what we
expect as a result it's going to lead to
this overflow that we are talking about</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
