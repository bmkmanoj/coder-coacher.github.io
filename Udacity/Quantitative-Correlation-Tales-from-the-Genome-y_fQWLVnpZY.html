can't use concordance because it's not a
simple yes no matching for height
remember concordance means there's
agreement between our categories so
we've got brown blue green and we're
looking for matching between our twins
but quantitative traits don't have these
categories so instead what we're doing
is we're measuring over a range of
possibilities and so we're going to
actually make what's called a
correlation rather than a concordance a
correlation is a statistical term
referring to an observable relationship
between any pair values what does that
mean exactly what it means is that if we
have a pair of twins where one twin has
a height that's almost the same as the
height of the other twin we would say
that these are correlated twin one and
twin to both had roughly the same height
if across many pairs of twins the height
of twin one is very similar to the
height of twin two then this results in
what we call a strong correlation but if
instead you see that the height
measurements between 21 and 22 are very
different then we would say that there's
a weak or no correlation at all now most
of the time we don't look at these kinds
of numbers in table format we look at
them in graph form take a look at these
four graphs right here comparing twin
height between 21 and 22 essentially
what we've done is we measure the twin
height for twin one and then we go up
and plot a point where we get to the
twin height of twin two we do this for a
huge number of twins and we have four
different results I want you to rank the
graphs from strongest correlation with
the number one to the weakest
correlation with the number four put the
numbers one two three and four in the
text boxes you see here ranking each
graph in order of strongest to weakest
correlation now this could be a little
more difficult if you don't have any
experience with statistics or looking at
correlation graphs before but I still
want you to give it a shot and see how
you do</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
