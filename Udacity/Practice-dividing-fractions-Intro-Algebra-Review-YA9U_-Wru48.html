be written as 1 4th times 3 / 11 times
three equals three and four times one
equals four so that gives us three
fourths one-third / one fourth can also
be written as one-third times for over
11 times four gives us four and three
times one is three this is important
notice that the order matters one fourth
divided by one-third is not the same
thing as one-third / 14 5 12 / 14 can be
written as 5 12 times for over 15 times
four equals 20 and 12 x 1 equals 12 this
needs to be simplified we know that 20
and 12 share a common factor of 4 20 can
be written as 4 times 5 and 12 can be
written as 4 times 3 I divide out the
four from the top and the bottom and
that leaves five thirds two-ninths /
three-fifths can also be written as
two-ninths times 5 thirds 2 times 5
gives us 10 and nine times three gives
us 27 this is already simplified so this
is our answer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
