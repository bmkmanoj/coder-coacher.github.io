curve after learning 12 moving on to
your second or do concepts kind of
crossover between them oh yeah concepts
definitely crossover because all the
frameworks are trying to accomplish the
same thing so if you figure out how to
do one thing at one framework then
comparing it to the next framework you
can like okay I know in anger i can do x
y&amp;amp;z like this and if you go this
framework the first thing you look for
is like okay how do i do XY and z in
this framework now and it's pretty
straightforward and luckily these
frameworks like a very competitive so
they try to compete with each other so
they set their documentation up like
that like it coming from angular to
check it out this is how you do this in
anger coming for acne this is how you
this in this framework so it's you could
definitely bring stuff over and I know
from experience that that works because
I actually tried to learn reacts while I
was learnt angler and I just I just
didn't get it I was like this is kind of
crazy but after I mass in England went
back to react and I like I built like a
couple apps in the day so it was pretty
straightforward after that once you
learned one they're all just the same
because it's not so much the syntax and
how their framework does it it's what
the framers trying to accomplish and you
notice that all frameworks are trying to
accomplish the same thing so once you
know that you're good okay so what is
some advice that you have for students
just diving into the world of frameworks
so like I said there's two steps of
learning there's the practical side
where you just you know how to use it
very very well you might not know what
those methods and functions and objects
as you interact are doing but you know
the result of them so you know how to
use it very well so i would say focus on
that practical side a lot of people want
to dive right in and try to understand
how all of its working the internals and
stuff it's actually very scary if you do
it that way especially angular anger is
one of the scariest frameworks on inside
it's almost like magic at first so I
would not hurt him in trying to figure
out how Ingo works internally at least
not yet but instead get very very good
at using angular the tools that it
provides and only way to do that is just
build a lot of stuff start off with a
small app you know that teaches you one
example and then eventually go up to
bigger apps that maybe work with servers
and eventually you've built you know
four or five six things that you can say
hey I've learned all the concept of
concepts of anger you feel pretty
comfortable using it and once you get
there then maybe if you're up for it
jump into how to how to actually works
on the inside which is only going to
enhance your your skill on the practical
side</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
