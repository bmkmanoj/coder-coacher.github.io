exhaustive list of everything you might
have related to exploratory data
analysis but here are some of the things
that we thought about if you have other
ideas please share your thoughts on the
form the first thing I noticed is that
Nathan use histograms to show the
distribution of TV sizes in any given
year you can also see that for each year
Nathan included a dark line in the
middle which represents the median size
television for that year so in 2005 it
looks like the median TV size was about
40 inches so half the TVs were larger
and half of them were smaller second
nathan describes where the data
originated in this case he got his data
from C net reviews Nathan describes a
caveat in the source of his data he
mentioned that the screen sizes are
based on the TVs that were on the market
at the time and not on how many people
actually bought them the average
television size that people bought could
be quite different from the average
television size on the market I think
the second part is key and it's
something that we should remember when
approaching any data set we should
always be skeptical of what store the
data may tell we should ask questions
about our data inspect it and consider
its context finally Nathan conducted a
time series analysis so each year after
2002 Nathan indicates whether the median
size of televisions increased or whether
or not it decreased in the case of the
circle we know that the television size
remain the same this leaves me wondering
what television sizes are doing now
maybe you can find some data out there
and let us know by the end of the course</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
