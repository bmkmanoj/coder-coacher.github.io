blue he's had a nasty run-in with a can
of paint now let's assume the bob has a
boolean formula not necessarily this one
but just some boolean formula and
suppose Bob comes to us and tells us
I've already found out that this boolean
formula is satisfiable now let's say we
don't necessarily trust Bob Bob is given
to exaggeration we'd like to be able to
figure out in polynomial time whether or
not Bob is telling us the truth so how
would we go about doing that let's say
Bob came to us with a complete series of
snapshots from a non-deterministic Ram
solving sat on his formula would that be
enough for us to believe that he had a
satisfiable formula how about if he had
a list of satisfiable clauses for
example he had a list that had X is
satisfiable clause and not why is a
satisfiable clause then for the entire
boolean formula could we then determine
whether it was satisfiable or not what
about if he had a satisfying assignment
for all of the variables in the formula
what if we had all the calls to if
better on the boolean formula so not
necessarily a complete series of
snapshots from a non-deterministic Ram
solving sat on his formula but just all
the calls diff better would that be
enough for us to believe Bob and finally
what if we had a satisfying assignment
for not all the variables but ninety
percent of the variables in Bob's
formula could we believe in that please
check all that apply</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
