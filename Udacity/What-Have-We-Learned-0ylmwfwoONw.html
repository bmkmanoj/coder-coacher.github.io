wanted to talk about in Triple C so we
talked about coordinating between agents
we talked about communicating between
agents and we talked about coaching or
kind of teaching instructing between
agents to convey an idea of a reward
function so what do you think is that
you ready to go through and kind of fill
in the topics that we touched on in each
of these I'm gonna say no and I don't
think that's on the screen no I'm
supposed to say yes it was it go through
it i'll tell you why because i think i
think this is really cool and I think
we're giving it short shrift I think
there are several more examples that we
could go through that would really kind
of drive home this point particularly
the coaching in communication point and
I think we should do it so let's let's
do some more of these so what you're
saying is you didn't think I lectured
enough and that I should now on the spot
make up more material that's kind of
tough well I don't know get to you don't
have to make up more material i mean the
material is out there you can just very
easily describe some stuff that we know
about how about doing that
no you know that dress I'd rather not I
mean I feel like we covered the topic
and we should just go with it okay I
think we can I can prove to you that we
haven't covered the topic and the way I
could prove it to you is simply by
covering more of the topic okay that's
fair alright so let's do that so you
know what here I'll make it easy for you
I have two or three things in mind that
I think that we could talk about that
would really kind of drive the point
home and I will talk about them happily
all right I appreciate that and I would
be very interested to hear what you have
to say about these topics so why don't
we why don't we stop for now and then
you can go research those topics then
we'll come back and talk about nope I'm
ready to talk about him now Wow okay
that's impressive thank you so you just
want to take over okay so the thing is
I'm actually in Rhode Island right now
mm-hmm and so it's not clear to me how
we can just kind of switch places and
let you drive well why don't we use the
magic of Technology</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
