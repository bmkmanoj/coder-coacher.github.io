see how you did let's start with the
personal DNA sample which can be used
for genome sampling in comparison we
learned how to acquire this personal DNA
sample in lesson 7 and what we're going
to be doing is genome sampling and
comparing individual snv's now an IBS
score or identity by state is a score
based on individual comparisons of
individual snv's this indicates a
genetic identity which we have greater
than seventy percent of for all SNV
matches in humans remember that you
share at least seventy percent IBS with
even the most distantly related human on
the planet this is a rough approximation
now another kind of scoring involves IBD
or identity by descent which scores
based on segments of chromosome sharing
individual snv's and this indicates
genetic relatedness which can reduce to
about one percent for third cousins and
beyond now altogether the essen vs that
we measure are located on the Y
chromosome which can be used to trace
the paternal lineage the mitochondrial
chromosome which is used to trace the
maternal line and autosomes in the X
chromosome which altogether can be used
to trace close and distant family
relations putting all of this
information together we've learned that
it indicates a human origin Out of
Africa with each expansion experiencing
genetic bottlenecks specifically
referred to as a founder effect but we
learned about these bottlenecks more in
lesson 6</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
