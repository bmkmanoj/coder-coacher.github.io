we can run out of directory entries so
if we need to allocate a new entry
because a block is being sent to a level
1 and level 2 cache and we need to mark
where its present the question is what
do we do in our directory and the answer
is we pick an entry to replace for
example using some sort of LRU algorithm
in our directory let's call that entry e
so that E is the entry we are replacing
not the new entry we are putting in the
new entry we put in we know what to do
with it we're going to set that one
presence bit to one the question is what
do we do about the entry e because that
entry might have some presence bit set
for every presence bit that is set in
that entry that we are replacing we need
to send an invalidation to the
corresponding cache pretty much this
entry says that that block is in some
caches we're going to tell these caches
to either invalidate or send us the data
and invalidate so that at the end of
this process all of the presents bit can
be set to zero at which point n 3 e can
be removed from the cache because all
presence bits are 0 and such an entry
does not need to be kept in the cache
and now we can put a new entry there so
note that now we are not in validating
blocks because of coherence we are in
validating them because of limited
capacity no directories so this
technically would be yet another type of
Miss that we can have it's a Miss that
had nothing to do with either coherence
or capacity or conflict or anything like
that it's a type of Miss that usually we
don't need to name but just be aware
that is that it exists so we can have a
cache miss in a level 1 or level 2 cache
that was caused by an invalidation and
that invalidation was not due to
coherence was not due to a right it was
due to a replacement of that blocks
