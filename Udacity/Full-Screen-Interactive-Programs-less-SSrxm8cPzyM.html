program but not every program we use in
the terminal works this way you've
already seen one program that doesn't
the man program for reading the manual
takes up a full terminal screen it's
actually using another program called
less that knows how to display text one
page at a time so when you press Q to
stop looking at a manual page you're
actually using a command that less
understands and you can use less to
display any file you like not just man
pages let's try using less on a long
text file remember to use tab completion
when entering long file names like this
one scrolling up and down arrow keys
works the same way as it did before and
man you can also scroll down a page at a
time by using the D key or by hitting
the spacebar you can scroll up one page
at a time with the euchy if you want to
skip to the very last line of the file
you can use the right angle bracket for
that to get back up to the first line
use the left angle bracket you can go to
a particular line by typing its line
number and hitting Enter this is
particularly useful when working with
source code where you know the line
numbers of important lines it's also
useful when you decide to quickly move
to the middle of a file less also has
built-in search types flash and then the
string you'd like to search for press
Enter or return to execute the search
you can find the next occurrence of the
search term by pressing in to go back to
the previous occurrence use capital n
search terms are case sensitive
searching for auditor with a lowercase o
won't find any capital o otters if
you're familiar with regular expressions
you can use them here less a search is
actually looking for lines that match
your pattern if you don't know regular
expressions you can still use less a
search capability but you should be
careful and only search for patterns
consisting of numbers and letters the
regular expression library will
interpret other characters in ways you
might not expect</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
