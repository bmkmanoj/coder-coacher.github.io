the capsule and in particular what are
the actions taken on capsule arrival at
a particular node now I mentioned that
the capsule does not contain code but it
is passed by reference or in other words
what the capsule contains is a type
identifier which is really a fingerprint
for the capsule code and the way this
type is generated it's basically a
cryptographic fingerprint of the
original capsule code in the original
implementation of ants toolkit they used
an md5 hash of the code and used that as
a fingerprint and it was the case that
at the time that this particular
research was done md5 hash was a
cryptographically strong hash function
which was not broken but subsequently
md5 hash has been broken but
nevertheless the key thing that I want
you to remember is that this type field
is a cryptographically strong
fingerprint that is derived from the
capsule code and that serves as a
reference for the code itself so when a
node receives a capsule one of two
things are possible the first
possibility is that this node has seen
capsules of this type before if that is
the case then it is quite likely that in
the soft store of this node the code
that corresponds to this type is already
existing in which case it's a simple
thing for the current node to retrieve
the code from its soft store and execute
the capsule and proceed with forwarding
this capsule on towards its desired
destination on the other hand if this
capsule that arrived at this node is the
first time that this node is seeing a
capsule of this type then obviously it's
not going to have the code that
corresponds to this type in this case
what this current node is going to do is
use the previous node field of the
capsule and send a request to the
previous node saying that hey I got this
capsule of this type I don't have the
code do you have the code if you have
please send it to me and when the
request comes in the previous node
obviously it has processed this capsule
before it's quite likely that this
previous node has the capsule code
in its soft store and so it retrieves it
from its soft store and sends it to the
next node so that the next node has the
capsule code now can execute it and also
store it now locally in its own soft
store so that future capsules of the
same type when they arrive here it can
be processed using the code that is now
stored in the soft store and the key
point to take away is that typically
when we are talking about network flows
we are sending a whole bunch of packets
one after the other and therefore even
though the first packet that comes to a
node may not find the code that is
associated with that particular type and
may have to do a little bit of heavy
lifting it's in terms of going and
reaching back to the previous node to
retrieve the code because network flows
is a whole bunch of packets there's
gonna be a whole lot of other packets
that come down the pike they're all
going to be processed using the soft
store and the code that is stored in the
soft store in other words we are
exploiting the locality for capsule
processing by storing the code that
arrives in response to a request back to
a previous node in the local soft store
one concern that we may have is that how
do I believe that the code that I got
from the previous node is actually the
code that corresponds to this type or
not well this is where the
cryptographically strong fingerprint
comes into play
what this node is going to do is when it
retrieves the code from the previous
node and when the code arrives it is
going to compute the fingerprint of the
code that it just got and see if that
fingerprint matches the type field of
the capsule if it does then it knows
that this code is genuine if it is not
then obviously somebody is trying to
prove my node by giving bogus code so
I'm going to detect it so coach spoofing
can be avoided by having a fingerprint
that is cryptographically strong so that
I can recompute the fingerprint match it
against the type and know that the
demand loaded code that I got is
actually the code that is associated
with this particular capsule and as I
mentioned already once I get this code
because I'm going to most likely see
capsules of this type in the future as
part of this particular network flow I'm
going to save the code in the
stro for future use so when a capsule
arrives at a node one of two things will
happen
one is I'm going to reach into my soft
store and see if I have the code that
matches this particular type in the
capsule if it isn't then I don't have
the code I'm going to reach back and get
it from the previous node but what if I
go back to the previous node and the
previous node does not have the code
that corresponds to this type so the
action of a node when it cannot find the
code that corresponds to a type either
locally this soft store or retrieve it
from the previous node is to simply drop
the capsule because what's going to
happen is that if this capsule is
dropped higher level acknowledgments
that are happening in that particular
Network flow is going to indicate to the
source that something did not get
through and that source node is going to
reach transmit that capsule this is
exactly the same thing that happens with
IP routing on the internet that is if a
node cannot process all the packet
either it gets it simply drops the
packet that's the same semantics that is
used for capsule processing also because
we are relying on higher-level protocols
the transport protocol that sits on top
of the network protocol do end-to-end
acknowledgement to make sure that all
the packets that they are expecting have
actually reached and therefore at the
level of capsule processing we don't
have to worry if we cannot process the
capsule either locally by using the code
in the soft store or by retrieving the
code from the previous node simply drop
the capsule now is it likely that when
we reach into the previous node that
node does not have the code for it
because after all it did process this
capsule and send this capsule onto me it
can happen because the soft store is
limited every router node has only a
finite capacity and all of its capacity
it's not going to give to a single
network flow it is going to give only a
part of its storage for the network flow
that is corresponding to a particular
capsule type and therefore I have to
live within my means so the capsule code
may have to throw away stuff every once
in a while if it is storing more than
what its capacity is in the soft store
so it is possible that the code that it
it stored in the soft store it had to
replace it because it was like a cache
and therefore it may have replaced it
and therefore it may not have it and
this is particularly possible if this
request comes at a much later time
because one of the things that you
associate with this kind of routing code
is that it is going to be timely so
there's going to be a time associated
with the validity of things that I want
to keep in my soft store so if I get a
request I just note at a much later
point in time because a capsule arrived
at this node traversing all over the
network it may not have the code that
corresponds to the type so it is
possible there will happens simply drop
the capsule and let the higher-level
entities in the protocol stack take care
of retransmitting the capsule it need me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
