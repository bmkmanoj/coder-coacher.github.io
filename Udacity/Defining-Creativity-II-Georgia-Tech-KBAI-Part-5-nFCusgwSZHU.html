community whose goal is to develop AI
agents at a creative in your own right
the current definition of creativity is
that something is creative if it is
novel valuable unexpected it is a
disused not just with creativity in a
sense of design creativity but with all
kinds of creativity so this could be a
scientific discovery that is creative
novel valuable unexpected it can also
capture art or music the notion of value
there may not be a monetary value it
might be of some interest to a recipient
creativity typically involves both a
producer and a receiver what is this
notion of unexpectedness of character
davis notion of non-obviousness so Ashok
what exactly is the difference between
novelty and unexpectedness if
something's novel isn't it all so
unexpected good question David novelty
here deals with newness unexpectedness
hideous with something non-obvious of
surprising but has this will become
clearer if I take an example so imagine
we decide to entertain a group of 20
friends we already know how to make
soufflés according to a particular
recipe will make souffle for 20 friends
this time we never made souffle for 20
people so saloon is novel something new
something we haven't done earlier on the
other hand we have known this recipe for
ages something unexpected would be if we
come up with a new recipe for this
souffle which stays dramatically
different surprisingly different not
just something new with something
unexpected so far we have been talking
about the product of creativity the
result of creativity the outcome of
creativity what about if processes of
creativity you use the term here some
and other both of these storms are
important let's first look at the term
other in this course we already talked
about several processes of creativity
analogical reasoning is a fundamental
process of creativity we already
explored analogical reasoning at the
context of design we just did that when
we were talking about design thinking
one might be able to design a new kind
of water pump by composing several water
pumps in series if one can analogically
transfer a design pattern from the
domain of electrical circuits was our
example
similarly under analogical reasoning we
were talking about the processes that
might be used to come up with a model
the atomic structure by analogy to the
model the solar system which clearly is
a creative process that cuts across
large number of dimensions of space and
time another place where we talked about
creative processes was when we are
talking about explanation based learning
it seems creative if the robot can go to
the kitchen and use the flower pot as a
cup to bring you coffee here are three
other processes of creativity emergence
re representation in serendipity a
simple example of emergence is that if i
draw three lines one two three then a
triangle emerges out of it the triangle
Ness doesn't belong to any single line I
was not even trying to draw a triangle I
just do three lines and a triangle
emerged out of it the emergence of the
triangle so the drawing or three lines
is a kind of creativity re
representation occurs when the original
representation of the problem is not
conducive to problem solving so we re
represent the problem and then come in
problem-solving to see an example of
this let's go back to atomic structure
and solar system problem suppose that we
have a model solar system which uses the
word the planets revolve around the Sun
we also have a model the atom and this
uses the term the electron rotates
around the nucleus so the model to the
Sun has the word revolves and model this
adam has the word rotates you Tuvok our
bodies are different if you would have
stables with this purpose or
representations mapping between rotate
and revolve will become very hard on the
other hand suppose you were to re
represent this problem we represent the
atomic structure we're drawing the
nucleus in the middle and the electron
around it we represent the solar system
by drawing the Sun in the middle and the
earth around it then in this new
representation we can see this
similarity we can do the mapping this
representation is another fundamental
process of creativity serendipity can be
of many types and can occur in many
different situations one kind of
serendipity occurs when I am trying to
address a problem but I am unable to
address it so I suspect the goal
start doing something different later at
some other time I come across a solution
and I connected with the previous
suspended goal the story has it that in
1941 in France George de Mestral wife
asked him to help her opened a dress by
pulling on a zipper because it was stuck
mr. all struggled with the zipper but
couldn't pull it down later on one day
miss Todd was walking his dog when he
found that some birds who were stuck to
the dog's legs curious about this
Mistral looked at the burrs closely
under a microscope he then connected the
solution the bird solution to the
opening of the zipper problem and out of
that was born the notion of velcro which
you and I are now used on a common basis
just like the word other was important
here these are three processes in
addition in the process we already
discussed in this class the word sum is
also important here this is not an
exhaustive list there in fact additional
things we can add for example another
potential processor is called conceptual
combination</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
