fixing alleles right being fixed is once
an allele reaches zero or hundred
percent so we're going to assume two
possible alleles a dominant and
recessive so we have a hundred percent
of individuals with the dominant
phenotype and twenty-five percent of two
dominant alleles that must mean that the
other 75% have a dominant and recessive
allele so neither the dominant or the
recessive allele right in this case the
dominant allele is not fixed at zero or
one hundred percent so that's not right
one hundred percent of individuals with
the dominant phenotype 0% have the
recessive that means they all must have
a dominant allele so this would be fixed
the dominant let's fix it 100% here are
under percent of individuals have the
recessive phenotype and one hundred
percent have the two recessive alleles
that means the dominant allele isn't
present at all it's fixed zero percent
so that's another option here fifty
percent of individuals have the
recessive phenotype and zero percent of
these have two dominant alleles well
yeah okay so there's no dominant alleles
in this fifty percent but that means the
remainder of the population must have
the dominant phenotype and they do have
dominant alleles at least one so it's
not fixes you were a hundred so only the
middle two options represent a fixed
allele at zero or a hundred percent</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
