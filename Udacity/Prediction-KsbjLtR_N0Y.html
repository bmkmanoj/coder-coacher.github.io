a time let's first look at the
prediction step ok so our prediction
step is given some belief about exit at
t minus one and given the measurements
all the way up through t minus 1 make a
prediction of xt state of time t still
given only the measurements through time
t minus 1 the way we do that and i'm
gonna be written out here and in sort of
a standard way and then we're going to
make specific use of that both
especially in particle filtering which
we'll do in a little bit what the way
you would do that is what's known as you
use the law of total probability and
marginalization right so the law of
total probability marginalization I'm
only supposed to be reminding here is
supposed to remember all your
probability theory right then if I've
got a joint density right p of a and B
if I integrate that over all the B's
what I'm left with is the density over a
alright that's marginalization so what
I'm going to do here is the idea is well
if I had a joint density of XT minus 1 +
xt and i were to integrate over all the
xt minus ones i would just have the
density over X T so that's the
marginalization and the reason we do
that is we can then break that integral
up into the following right so you might
remember the conditioning right
probability of a and B is the
probability of a given B times the
probability of B that's what says down
here so I've just broken up this
integral down into this we're here is
the probability of xt minus 1 given
everything up through t minus 1 and i
multiply that times the probability of
xt given xt minus 1 and everything else
so i'm just applying the conditioning
property to that integral and then i can
use that independence assumption that we
said before remember the independence
assumption is that if i want the
probability of xt and I've given the
previous state and a bunch of other
things those other things don't matter
the only thing that matters is that
previous state that's our
dynamics model so basically we have two
things here we have our belief about t
minus 1 given everything up through t
minus 1 and then we have our dynamics
those are the two components that it
takes in order to make that guess going
forward</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
