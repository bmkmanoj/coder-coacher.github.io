that's very helpful about regression is
that in many ways it's very simple to
visualize is very simple to think about
what some of the issues are and all the
various topics in machine learning that
are really important to understand and
sometimes are difficult concepts really
do come up in a fairly easy to
understand way so what I'd like to do
now is to step through an example of
doing some regression and to point out
what some of the pitfalls are and how
they're generally handled in the machine
learning context so this graph that I
put up here is we just made these
numbers up but it's supposed to tell us
a little bit about housing prices so
let's imagine that we're off to buy a
house and what we notice is there's lots
of different houses on the market and
there are lots of different sizes right
so the square footage of the house can
vary in this case of the houses that I
visited between about a thousand to ten
thousand square feet and of course as
you get bigger houses you tend to get
more the prices tend to go up too right
so the price that the house cost is
tends to rise with the size of the house
so what I've done here is I plot it as a
little X say a set of nine houses that
I've observed start off over here with
the house that's a thousand square feet
and it costs a thousand dollars I don't
know what era this happened in and we
end up with a house that is ten thousand
square feet and costs about six thousand
dollars again I don't this is not true
in Providence Rhode Island I'll tell you
that are you sure yeah I'm pretty sure
yeah certainly not true in Atlanta
Georgia so all right so so so imagine
that these are this is the relationship
that we observe and now we want to
answer a question like well what happens
if we find a house on the market and
it's about five thousand dollars what do
you think a fair price for that would be
so what do you what do you think Charles
looking at this what do you think a fair
price for a 5,000 square-foot house
would be apparently about five thousand
dollars about five thousand dollars
right so how did you do that I looked at
the graph I went over to five thousand
square feet on the x-axis and I went up
until I found where one of the x's was
on the y-axis and I said oh that's about
five thousand square feet
well but there was no corresponding
point for the
so you had to interpolate or something
based on the points that were there you
had to kind of imagine what might be
happening at the 5000 square foot mark
right that's true although this one was
a little easy because at 4,000 and 6,000
square feet they're almost exactly the
same hmm and so that's - you've made it
feel like there was probably that's
probably the level where things in this
range would be yeah okay all right that
seems kind of reasonable so I'm sure
though what we're going to do in this
case is actually try to find a function
that fits this mm-hm
all right so what we can do is actually
say well what if there's a linear
relationship what would be the best
linear function that captures the
relationship between the size and the
cost so what I have here is it turns out
of all the possible linear functions
this is the one that minimizes the
squared error the squared deviation
between the these X points and the
corresponding position on the Green Line
so it finds a way of balancing all those
different errors against each other and
that's the that's the best line we've
got now in this particular case it's
interesting right because if you put
your your idea of 5,000 square feet look
what this line predicts it's something
more like 4,000 dollars right do you see
that I do that doesn't seem right to me
it doesn't yeah it doesn't really look
like a very good fit but it does at
least capture the fact that there's
increasing cost with with increasing
size that's true</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
