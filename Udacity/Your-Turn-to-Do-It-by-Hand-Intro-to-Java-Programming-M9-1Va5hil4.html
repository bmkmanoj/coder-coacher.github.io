with specific values let's do it in
general so what did we do we started
with the width of the floor subtracted
the size of the first white tile divided
by the sizes of the pairs took the
integer part and that gave us the number
of pairs now that's of course the same
as the number of red tiles as every pair
has one red tile and the Y tiles is one
more all right now we're ready to
program and what I'd like you to do is
to complete the program that we started
for you
the program will read as inputs the
width of the floor and the tile size and
your job will be to run the computation
that I've just developed and to print
the answer here's the program for you to
fill in you already given the commands
for the input and for the output and
your job was to put in the part of the
program
that does the computation now we did
this by hand and let me show you again
the formula that we obtained that's the
formula here so we take the width minus
the tile size divided by twice the style
size take the integer part</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
