program manager here at Udacity managing
the app entrepreneurship nanodegree
thank you so much for talking to us
today see it thanks David good to be
here so C is an experienced online
student as well as a manager of online
programs so I want to start off by
asking you what are some of the exciting
kind of new things that are coming out
in online education that some of our
students might not yet be aware of so a
year ago Harvard Business School
launched a program called hbx core so
what is really interesting about this is
that instead of disrupting it's like
core business which is I do graduate
students as an MBA degree instead
extending the pipeline by targeting
students who are undergraduates or just
before the MBA stage to teach them like
critical skills and like economics
business analytics and financial
accounting so these are the three
classes that hpx offers and it's a
three-month program it costs about 1500
to 1800 dollars and I'm students
completed in cohorts essentially so I'm
each cohort consists of about 600
students and they go through the program
and gain these skills and then take a
final exam at a Pearson test center so
it's a pretty interesting experience and
I just completed that about two months
ago that's very cool it's interesting
that I think an online education first
cuts are in the reason why we have
separate modules in this course for
online learning and MOOCs is that you an
online education guide you know really
got started a few years ago MOOCs were
really all the rage it was all about
these giant open courses and we're just
going to put it out there and if we
build it they will come I think we're
seeing more and more what you're
describing of more closed somewhat gated
programs that have a monetary cost
associated with them and have some kind
of credential associated at the end and
we see the same thing I think at
Coursera and here at Udacity I can you
comment on the new issues in those
directions at those companies so finding
that like an input in courses together
as package like this then prove
retention rates across all companies so
hpx core has a completely as a
completion rate of eighty-five percent
which is really high for online learning
maybe because of like Harvard's name or
maybe because of the giant Lake price
tag but it's really working for these
companies and across across MOOCs like
the average completion rate used to be
between three percent and thirteen
percent and
with nanodegree specializations by Chris
era and the program such as hbx core
they've gone up to between the 60s and
eighty percent completion rate which is
much more because I guess you get a
degree or certification at the end
coursera specializations are really
interesting also I've looked into the
business fundamentals one that warden is
providing collaboration of Coursera amid
consists of four courses and a capstone
project in the end so what I really
liked about it was the capture project
was designed to 500 startups it was this
very cool incubator program and it was
like an opportunity to page 25 min
startups started probably resolving
however what I did like what the course
was that all the program was that all
the four courses were about big business
things so it was like about like
financial accounting in a big company or
like business analysis at a big company
and not like the startup kind of
problems you're trying to solve yes as a
start-up you have no data you haven't
met things like know finances hi there
so it was a bit disconnected there but I
really like where they going with that
and i think that would Borden's backing
it may get somewhere university of
maryland has AA one on that platform
that's on entrepreneurship as well it
actually has the exact opposite thing it
covers all about funding and startup
issues and basically by the time you're
in a company with 15 employees
specialization is nothing to say about
you it's all about getting to that
initial point so why do you think that
there's such a move right now I guess he
already commented on it the retention
rates are higher with them these
specializations or negative degrees what
we do on X series on EDX why do you
think that the the retention goes up
when we have those kind of knit together
programs as opposed to individual
courses I guess because each of the
programs gives you a goal hpx is trying
to pitch that this is preparing you for
business school so and that way they
have a huge pipeline students from there
as a part of business school um course
eres incentivizing students to go
through the warden specialization just
to get like free warden application the
end so those kind of initiatives are
helping and of course capacity in the
careers so we're trying to help them get
my expense for careers which is great
too so I think those goals are great and
also having a cohort system of students
who are kind of like
encouraging you and also holding you
liable to complete really helps too yeah
I think we see a lot of that in the LMS
program as well it's actually built a
minute very many ways around the same
model it's a credential at the end it's
some people who join the same semester
and the semesters are long enough that
you kind of have a a cohort within the
semesters but I would be willing to bet
in fact we have evidence to suggest it
the courses on their own are you know
they're nice but very few people take
them if there's not that big credential
at the end there's something about that
big external motivator that yeah is the
reason why people go to traditional
college and sounds like they're trying
to include that in some more online
education initiatives even if it means
compromising the massiveness of these
initiatives in the past so sometimes I
was not very motivated during the HP X
Corps program because I'm like have a
full-time job it's very difficult to do
I can also possess 10 to 15 hours a week
gets hard so what in creation me during
that time was my classmates might became
really good friends at some of them and
they would be like okay come on see ya
but that's nice two days from now let's
get started and those kind of things and
also what HP scored it very successfully
that I think other platforms are trying
to emulate is provided a social factor
so you can hear your classmates
responses and stuff as you go through
the course so when they ask questions
and when they direct questions to you
and it keeps you motivated to answer
them yeah so I think those two
components really helped yeah absolutely
I'm doing anything last you want to say
to our online students from the
perspective of either someone producing
online education or a consumer of online
education yes so it's very difficult to
complete courses especially when you
have other commitments but I think
everyone should find at least one friend
in every class that they take to make
sure that the buddy system kahnawake
works and everyone goes through those
courses together and I think that online
education will only work if people get
in some advice with those kind of social
interactions so definitely find a friend
and get started on that and as designers
of EdTech also design things in such a
way that the people using your product
or using your tools can connect with
others and awesome
artner with them or even design tools
that explicitly facilitate that so many
of you might be interested in
computer-supported collaborative
learning where you can actually develop
tools that make this kind of
collaboration at a distance I'm much
more easy I think one thing that's been
very empowering to me in this program is
that the online environment kind of
creates this 24-7 classroom and because
of that you always have people you can
talk to and you can always go to the
classroom and find someone to chat with
and building tools that can enhance that
even more I could really improve what we
do in online education so so thank you
so much for talking to us via things
