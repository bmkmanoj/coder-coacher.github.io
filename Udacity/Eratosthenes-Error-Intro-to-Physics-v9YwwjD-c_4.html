which is 46,000 250 minus forty thousand
or six thousand two hundred fifty over
forty thousand and of course we have to
multiply by 100 to make it a percent and
we get an answer of 15.6 or I'll just
call it 16 percent error now 16 percent
seems like a lot this experiment like
every experiment ever done in physics is
subject to error now the tricky thing is
identifying and quantifying the sources
of our error now in this situation we're
really lucky we have a known reference
number to compare to we know the earth
has a circumference of 40,000 kilometers
so when we make some calculations and
get an answer that's different we can
immediately quantify how wrong we were
but when Eratosthenes was doing this
experiment he didn't know that he had no
idea what the actual circumference was
and so it would have been to his benefit
to keep track of error as he was going
along so let's do that for this
experiment</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
