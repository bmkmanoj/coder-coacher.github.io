learned a lot of powerful mathematics in
the last 20 minutes so let's think how
we're going to use this doesn't seem to
make sense to keep calculating the sine
of 37 degrees every single time we
encounter a triangle with a 37 degree
angle this number is never changing the
sine will always be 3 over 5 so what
they did in Eratosthenes day was
calculate large tables of trigonometric
ratios they would find the sine cosine
and tangent of a variety of angles and
save it away for future reference here's
an example table of trigonometric ratios
in the columns we have sine cosine and
tangent and we have these values
computed for well just a few degrees
here 40 41 42 degrees in a better table
we'd have a larger range of angles and
higher resolution so we'd have forty
point one degrees forty point two
degrees and so on but this will work for
now what this table allows us to do is
something really amazing so let's say we
have a triangle and it's a right
triangle with an angle here of 42
degrees and let's say we know this
length it's 1,000 meters how can I find
this length this is something we haven't
done yet what I can do is say ah I know
that the ratio of this side to this side
is totally independent of how long these
sides actually are in fact this side
being adjacent to 42 degrees and this
side being hypotenuse looks like we're
gonna want to use a cosine which
compares adjacent to hypotenuse in fact
what I can say is that the cosine of 42
degrees which I can look up in my table
it's zero point seven four three must be
equal to the adjacent side I'll call
that X for now over the hypotenuse and
the hypotenuse has a length of 1,000
meters this is a huge huge tool to have
because now all we have to do is
multiply by 1,000 to solve for X and we
find that X is equal to 743 meters now
I'm going to give you a shot let's call
this unknown length why can you go
through a similar set of steps
maybe you won't be using cosign this
time to figure out how long is this side
why</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
