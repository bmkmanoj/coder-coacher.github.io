ensure this probability is less than 1/2
and the way to think about this is
assuming the uniform distribution of our
ideal hash function every time the
probability that one guess maps to H is
1 over the number of deaths or 2 to the
negative B we'll use B to represent the
number of bits so with our random Oracle
model for any given guess the
probability that it passes to a
particular value is 2 to the negative B
the probability a guess is bad is 1
minus that and now over a series of
guesses the probability that they're all
bad is that raised to the number of
guesses power and we've said that K is
equal to the number of guesses here
which we said was 2 to the 62 and we can
solve 1 minus 2 to the negative 62 to
the 2 to the 62 that's equal to
approximately zero point 6 3 there are
lots of ways to solve this you could try
computing this in Python these numbers
get pretty big the easiest way to solve
this is you just plug this into Wolfram
Alpha
there are also certainly mathematical
things you could do to get this equation
in a simpler form but since we just want
the answer it's easier to just try
plugging in some numbers if we increase
the number of bits by 1 that means the
probability for each guess being bad
increases the 1 minus 2 to the negative
63 and that turns out to be 0.39 that
means 63 is the fewest number of bits to
provide the attacker with less than a
50% chance of finding a pre-image that
maps to the same hash value in 2 to the
62 guesses</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
