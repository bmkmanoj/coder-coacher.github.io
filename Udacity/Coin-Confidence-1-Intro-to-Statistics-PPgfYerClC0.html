plus/minus term of the compass interval
and here's how it looks like we will
place the analytic variance by the
empirical variance over here but
otherwise it's the same as before so I
just calculated this and here's what I
get so for this sample that means we
would say between the probability 0 &amp;amp; 1
we believe most likely the coin is
biased is 0.75 probability but we aren't
quite sure we have a conference and
developers point for too wide on both
sides
in fact it reaches beyond 1 which is a
funny side effect of using the normal
assumption and this is the revolve in
which we are uncertain about what the
correct value of the coin is in fact
this one does include point 5 it could
be that this coin is perfectly unbiased
0.75 minus 0.42 is much smaller than 0.5
obviously it's a small sample so let's
do the same thing for a larger sample
and this one is a quiz for you so use
the sample I've ordered it there's three
tails and seven heads and I want you to
just compute for me
the mean plus minus this constant is
interval width term so please give me
both numbers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
