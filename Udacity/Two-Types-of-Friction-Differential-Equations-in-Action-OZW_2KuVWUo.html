it and for breaking it's vital to
distinguish between two different
regimes of friction static friction and
kinetic friction if this object is at
rest with respect to that surface we can
apply forces up to a certain threshold
force without setting this object in
motion it remains static experiments
show that this threshold of force is a
constant times the weight force which
often is called n because it's a normal
force is perpendicular to the surface
this coefficient is called the
coefficient of static friction mu s as
long as the force that we apply it
doesn't exceed this force this object
won't be set in motion when this force
becomes larger than the threshold the
object will be set in motion for example
if the mass of this object is 1 kilogram
the gravitational force would be almost
10 Newtons a pretty high value for this
coefficient of static friction would be
1 which means that the threshold Force
is at 1 times 10 Newtons it would have
to exert a force of 10 Newtons or more
to set this object in motion if we apply
less it remains static typically this
coefficient of static friction ranges
between 1/3 and 1 which means that
typically to set an object in motion you
need to apply less force sideways than
the force with which gravity pulls that
object down things are easier in the
kinetic regime we need to apply a
certain force to keep this object going
at a constant velocity so this force is
nothing else but the force exerted by
friction and from experiments we find
that this force is some constant times
the normal force the force exerted by
gravity in this case and this is the
coefficient for kinetic friction and in
the kinetic regime we got the same
expression but it's an equal sign in
this case it's not a threshold we
compute the force as such what's of
eminent importance for braking is that
the coefficient of static friction
tends to be larger than the coefficient
of kinetic friction the coefficient of
kinetic friction maybe one quarter less
than the coefficient of static friction
or it may even be smaller and now think
about braking we want to apply the
maximum amount of friction the maximum
amount of friction is found in the
static regime because the coefficient of
static friction is higher than the
coefficient of kinetic friction so what
we need to prevent is the locking of
wheels when the wheel stays locked its
sliding on the ground and when the
regime of kinetic friction</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
