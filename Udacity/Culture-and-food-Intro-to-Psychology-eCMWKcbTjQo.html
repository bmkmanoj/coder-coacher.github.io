biological influence but culture plays a
factor as well
the psychology of what we eat has to do
with external factors such as the sight
of food the smell of food and
importantly the culture in which we were
raised that is what one person may find
delicious another person may find
inedible children for example who are
exposed to spicy foods early in life
quickly develop a taste and even
cravings for the spicy foods later in
life likewise people who were not
exposed to spicy foods find them too
overpowering for them
similarly brains and intestines are
delicious in some cultures yet beef is
disgusting or even sacrilegious and
others in most cases except for sweets
food preferences are acquired and learn
taste it's safe to say that food and
cuisine are key traits of any culture
with each culture having its own unique
cuisine and food</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
