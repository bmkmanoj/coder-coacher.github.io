the fact that the earth is a sphere well
we decided that's not 100% true but the
earth is so close to spiracle that any
area introduces is negligible we also
decide that the sun's rays don't arrive
exactly in parallel there are you gonna
do more about this in the homework but
the area this introduces turns out to be
negligible let's talk about 0.3 do the
sun's rays actually arrive vertically in
siene now to answer this question let's
think back to how Eratosthenes came to
this conclusion Eratosthenes had come to
this conclusion by hearing that if you
look down a well not necessarily a
poorly drawn well but oh well in CN a on
the summer solstice you could see the
very bottom what this meant was that the
sun's rays must have been striking in
such a way that array which entered the
top of the well could make it all the
way to the bottom and so his conclusion
was that the sun's rays are striking
vertically now let's see if this is
necessarily the case
sure array that comes in vertically will
make it all the way to the bottom of the
well no problem but is that the only ray
that will go from top of the well to the
bottom no what about this one this ray
also illuminates the bottom of the well
and it comes in at a slight angle now
let's look at what the maximum possible
angle could be that would allow one of
these rays to enter the top of the world
and still illuminate the ground below
and that would be this ray if we tried
to make this angle any steeper it
wouldn't actually hit the bottom of the
well would hit somewhere along the wall
so how can we calculate this angle well
let's make some assumptions about the
depth of the well and the width of the
well the Eratosthenes was looking at now
I'm no well expert but I'm going to
assume that this well had a depth of 40
meters those of you who know more about
wells than I do can tell me if this is a
reasonable depth for a well I'm going to
assume that the width of the well so
from this edge to this edge was about
one meter now we have the dimensions of
our well we have an extreme case solar
ray coming down
and just barely illuminating the bottom
of the well now I wonder what angle does
this correspond to we know it's not
quite vertical using your new tree
skills I bet you can tell me what this
angle alpha is that this ray is making
with the vertical enter your answer in
this box rounded to two decimal places
and remember Google is your friend</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
