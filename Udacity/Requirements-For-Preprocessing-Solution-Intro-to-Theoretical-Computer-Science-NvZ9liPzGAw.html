true here the first one is polynomial
time because we're trying to do
pre-processing for problems that
normally require exponential time so if
we don't have this requirement here you
could use pre-processing to already
solve the problem because then you would
have exponential time and that really
did wouldn't make any sense of course in
practice it could make sense to have
certain exponential time pre processing
algorithms where for example the base of
the exponent is much smaller than of the
general algorithm but actually I've
never seen that done and right now for
us polynomial time is a good requirement
to have speeding up worst-case running
time is in my opinion not a requirement
for preprocessing of course you would
like to get a speed-up but on the other
hand as you've seen the pre-processing
rules are very simple so we might always
encounter instances where pre-processing
does not apply but that doesn't mean we
shouldn't do it pre-processing runs in
polynomial time so it's easy to do so we
should just hope that pre-processing
helps us but not make it a requirement
and finally that is of course very
important pre-processing must not affect
the solution that we get in the end if
we have a decision problem where the
answer is yes or no after pre-processing
we want the answer to be the same of
course and the same as for optimization
problems if the answer is 10 11 or 12
then after pre-processing the answer
should remain 10 11 or 12 because
otherwise pre-processing would actually
alter the problem and it would alter the
solution to that problem which of course
is something we do not want</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
