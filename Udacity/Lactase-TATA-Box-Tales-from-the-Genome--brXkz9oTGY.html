than this I hope you didn't think I was
leading you on because I was not joking
about this top top box the ta-a ta-a a
sequence otherwise known as the tata box
is a real thing and it's also real in
the lactase gene here we have the +1
transcription start signing the lactase
gene that's where I started capitalizing
the letters in green here we have the
ATG which would be transcribed right to
the Aug and the mRNA this would be where
translation would start for the lactase
coding region and we'd get our protein
but how does this transcript even start
we need this tata sequence in front this
consensus tata sequence is a core piece
of the promoter region of the lactase
gene without this tatar region the
correct proteins can't bind and
facilitate the initiation of
transcription which begins right here
everything that happens for
transcription depends on sequences like
this tata sequence in the promoter
region now what you're about to hear is
not made up it's not hypothetical this
is reality and the lactase gene if we
zoom out right will see that this tata
region is about minus 30 right it's 30
base pairs 30 letters in front of the
transcription initiation site for the
lactase gene and if we zoom out and look
at the whole chromosome where the
lactase gene is sitting we can put this
in context the tata box in this sense is
right next to the transcription start
site it turns out that some people in
the human population have a letter
difference a letter change in the
non-coding region in front of lactase
gene that significantly affects the
expression of lactase its own
transcription and the amazing thing is
that this letter this single letter
variation in humans that affects
transcription of the lactase gene is
more than 20,000 letters or base pairs
away from the transcription initiation
site this is not just like the Tata
region right minus 30 in front we are
20,000 letters away
and we're affecting transcription right
here now that's gonna take some
explaining</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
