pick one differential equation as the
one that advanced the study physics the
most which one would you pick Hamilton's
equations for classical mechanics
Maxwell's for electrodynamics
Schrodinger equation for quantum
mechanics Einstein field equations or
something else that's like asking me to
choose between my children I mean
they're not my children but that is like
it they're all remarkable structures
which one has changed the physics the
most go back give them to me again
okay so Hamilton's equations are the
basic equations of classical mechanics
they tell you how classical mechanical
systems they are the predictive
equations for how particles move or how
anything changes with time obviously
they have had a enormous impact in
physics and the impact covers every area
of physics every area they're there in
quantum mechanics are there in classical
mechanics that are there in quantum
field theory they're everywhere
okay what was the next one Maxwell's
equations are a little more special
they're a little more special they have
to do with a specific class of phenomena
electricity and magnetism
electromagnetic troe magnetic fields so
they're a little bit narrower but on the
other hand they did something remarkable
they taught us what light is
up until Maxwell's equations nobody knew
what light was so how do you compare
something like Maxwell's equations with
that other fellow Hamilton's equations
which one is more important it's a
matter of taste do you think explaining
light was more important or less
important than having a framework for in
a sense all of physics matter of taste
I like those t-shirts that have the
Maxwell's equation they'd be like what
was the third one an extra straighting
equation okay so Schrodinger's equation
there Schrodinger's equation has
different meanings to sometimes two
physicists it can mean a very
general kind of equation which tells
them how the quantum state of a system
changes with time or it can mean the
very specific equation the Schrodinger
wrote down the very specific equation
the Schrodinger wrote down had to do
with again a special class of phenomena
motion of a particle quantum mechanical
motion of a particle but there's a
there's a generalization of it there's a
generalization of it that has to do with
how any quantum system behaves in the
sense it's as broad and as important as
Maxwell's occurs Hamilton's equations
it's it is the quantum mechanics what
Hamilton's equations were the classical
mechanics so extremely important but I
think in the end you're gonna have a
hard time getting me to say I favor one
over the other what about a what about
the field equations the Einstein field
equations yes they of course are the
sort of quintessential deep deep
equations about what space and time are
there like Maxwell's equations and that
they govern a special class of phenomena
gravity in this case but they're more
than that they're telling us something
extremely deep about the nature of space
and time that it's curved that that the
that the geometry of space and time is
not what Euclid thought it was and how
that geometry responds to matter so
again it's you you certainly picked what
I would say are the four most important
deepest favorite equations of
theoretical physicists for sure I am
gonna refuse to pick between them there
are four of them I have four children
and never would I pick between my four
children when we get a theory that
describes that encompasses all of this
it's it can be described with the
differential equation oh boy is it going
to is the final theory going to be
described by a differential equation
okay so there are a lot of people and
I'm not going to place myself right now
there are a lot of people who think the
world is really discrete space and time
might be discrete comes in little
elementary steps if that's the case then
at that level at the smallest possible
distances in the world it might mean
that the mathematics of it is discrete
mathematics the mathematics of little
steps individual indivisible steps and
not smooth them continuous evolution if
that's the case no it won't be described
by differential equations but we don't
know if I know the answer to that I
would publish it as in this class we
model the model phenomena discretely
even even when the underlying assumption
is that it's continuous but the computer
programs all have things exactly so you
see that that in many cases it really is
not possible to tell whether a certain
equation is describing something which
is truly continuous or whether it's
describing some discrete phenomena where
the little steps occur fast enough and
one after another too fast to be able to
see okay so we don't know what the final
theory of nature will be</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
