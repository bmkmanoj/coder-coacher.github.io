names in the first column we can use the
replace function within the formula tool
to replace the quotation marks with no
character there by getting rid of them
we attached the formula tool choose the
name field to update on the functions
tab choose the name field to update open
up the string functions and look for the
replace function we're going to double
click on it to drop it into the
expression area the string is
highlighted and so we're going to select
the field that we want to update we go
two variables existing fields and select
name double click on it to drop it into
the expression from here we're going to
identify the string we're looking for
which is a quotation mark so we put that
where it says target and we put single
quotes around it if this was any other
character we could put it in double
quotes or single quotes where it says
replacement we simply put an open quote
close quote to identify that we want to
replace it with nothing there by
removing it when we run all tricks we
can now see that the quotation marks are
removed from the name field next we'll
need to get rid of the extra letter at
the end of the zip code we can remove
the extra letter by simply taking the
first five characters of the zip code
starting from the left side this will
result in us dropping the last character
when there are more than five characters
in the zip code to do this we choose the
zip code field as the output field in
the functions to do this we go back to
the formula tool and choose the zip code
field as the output field in the
expression box we go to functions string
and we choose the left function double
click to drop it in and where it says
string we replace with the zip code
field where it says le n which stands
for length we type in five when we run
the workflow now we'll see the zip code
with just five characters lastly we're
going to remove the currency symbol in
of the numbers in the amount field this
is somewhat similar to the first field
where we were getting rid of the
quotation marks but in this case we have
multiple characters to remove we go back
to the formula tool select the amount
field and instead of using the replace
function we use the function called
replace CH AR double click to drop it
down the string is replaced with the
amount field and the Y is replaced with
a list of characters you want to replace
inside of the quotation marks to do this
we simply just listed the characters no
need for a comma or delimiter in between
them but we make sure to put them inside
of quotation marks then we replace the Z
with the value we want to replace it
with we want them to replace with
nothing so that is represented by an
open quote close quote basically nothing
between the clothes we see that the
currency symbols are now removed so this
is three ways to remove extra characters
