in computer science a matrix is
essentially a 2d array but the lists
inside are all the same length a matrix
can also be called a rectangular array
when you look at it it looks like a
rectangle the adjacency matrix is
actually really similar to the adjacency
list the indices in the outer array
still represent nodes with those IDs and
the list inside still represents which
nodes are adjacent
however these inner lists represent
information in a slightly different way
before the list contained just the IDS
of adjacent nodes now the inner list has
one slot for every node in the array
where node IDs map to array indices if
there's an edge between these two nodes
a one goes into the array if there's no
edge a zero is present you might notice
that the diagonal or the place on every
line where the row number equals the
column number is always zero this value
would only be one if there is an edge
that started and ended with the same
node but we don't have any of those in
our graph you should also note that a
single edge shows up twice in the matrix
for example this edge shows up when the
row is zero and the column is 1 and also
when the row is 1 in the column is zero
which method of representation you use
depends on what makes the most sense for
you and what operations you'll be
performing the most often if you're
looking at node degree or the number of
edges connected to a particular node the
adjacency list will probably be the
fastest</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
