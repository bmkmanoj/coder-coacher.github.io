for getting at least half of these right
if you really struggled with these I
would go back and review factoring try
and get in some more practice before
moving on if you only missed one or two
then see if you can find your mistakes
by looking at your factors if you can't
find your mistakes and continue watching
the solution to see where your reasoning
went wrong the greatest common factor
for these three terms is one so let's
use factoring by grouping to get our two
factors we want factors of negative 30
that's sum to negative 1 the factors are
negative 6 and positive 5 then we can
use factoring by grouping to get the
factors of 3 x + 1 + 5 X minus 2 this is
our first numerator for the denominator
we want to find factors of negative 20
that's some de positive 8 the factors
would be positive 10 and negative 2 we
use factoring by grouping to get our
denominator of 2 X plus 5 times 2x minus
1 here next we factor this trinomial the
greatest common factor for each term is
1 so we need to find factors of negative
60 that's sum to negative 7 we don't
need to factor out a GCF these two
factors are negative 12 and positive 5
they might have been tough to find we
use factoring by grouping to get 2x plus
5 times X minus 6 and this is what we
put in our numerator for our second
denominator we want to find factors of
negative 30 that's some the positive 13
we use factoring by grouping to get our
factors of x + 3 + 5 X minus 2 and now
we're done factoring and we're ready to
simplify</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
