thinking at multiple levels we're
thinking about different aspects of that
program for example we always have to
think about is the program correct does
it implement what we want it to
implement and we saw on the zebra puzzle
that we also want to worry about is it
efficient maybe we have a correct
program but it takes an hour and we'd
rather have a program that takes a
thousandth of a second and we also have
to worry about the debugging process of
as we're developing the program we're
building up all sorts of scaffolding to
make it run properly that maybe we won't
need later now traditionally we write
our program some of what we've written
has to deal with having it be correct
and then some of the code interspersed
in there deals with deficiency and now
we've talked about adding further code
that deals with debugging it and we end
up with this mess that's all interleaved
and wouldn't it be nice if we could
break those out so that some of the
debugging statements were separate some
of the efficiency statements could live
someplace else and the main sort of
correctness program could say stay
distinct from the other parts and this
idea is called aspect-oriented
programming and it's an ideal that we
can strive for we don't get it
completely but we should always think of
can we separate out these different
aspects or concerns as much as possible
so what I want what I want to ask is if
I've written the function this way as
this big generator expression rather
than as nested statements I can't have
count equals count plus one statements
inside here because there's no place to
put something inside a statement and I'd
like to separate out the counting as
much as I can from the puzzle to do the
minimum amount of damage or editing to
allow me to insert these bookkeeping
nodes that do the counting so let's
think about that what would be the right
way to do that and I'll tell you what I
came up with this is the second best
answer I came up with and that's to say
well what am i doing I'm I'm counting
iterations through the orderings so
maybe the place to insert my annotations
is right here and I want this to be a
debugging tool for debugging tools I'm
willing to have shorter names because
things that really aren't going to stick
around I'm going to use them for a while
and then I'm going to get rid of them
I'm willing to have a one character name
here although bothers me a little bit
and I can always rename it as something
else and what I'll do is I'll just
insert this call to the function C
around each of my uses of orderings so
I'm going to insert 1 2 3 times 5 15
characters so there we are I think
that's a lot less intrusive than putting
in a lot of count equals count plus one
statement so I'm pretty happy with that
so what I've done here is defined a
function called instrument function
which will count the calls that it takes
to to execute the calling of a function
with the arguments and I've arranged I
haven't shown you the definition of C
yet but when I show it to you I will see
that it keeps track of two counts the
number of starts of the times we started
in iteration started the for loop that
was measured with the C function and the
number of items that we got through so
how many times did we go through that
for loop we initialize those counts to 0
we call the function and then we say
what do we get back and with the zebra
puzzle it only took us 25 iterations
over 2,700 items puzzle - this was the
definition for when we took the original
definition and then moved only one of
the constraints up in the ordering that
gave us this number of iterations and
items and I didn't show that the puzzle
where none of the constraints are moved
up that would have taken even more so we
see even here quite a reduction in the
number of iterations and the counts and
this tells you how efficient we are</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
