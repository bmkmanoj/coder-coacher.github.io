might be the end user of your
undocumented
I'm here with art director of
engineering here at Udacity so art tell
me a horror story tell me a time you
were really kicking yourself for not
writing documentation oh that's a good
question Walter um
feedback too early in my career I was
doing a project for a very sort of
conservative stuffy investment bank on
Wall Street and I was doing this support
screen that comes up like if somebody
that's using the app needs help you know
they click you know help and it comes up
with a phone number but we didn't yet
have the phone number so I have a
placeholder phone number but I forgot to
put in the readme that somebody needed
to update that before they shipped it so
I just put in the first thing that
popped into my mind which was one 900 of
the name of the cup we'll say ABC
forever for EBA right yeah and I ship it
you know I collect my fee don't think
anything of it six months later I get
this frantic call from the project
manager freaking out because one of
their customers had called the number
nobody had ever updated the help number
there's no calls me up and he's like why
did you put an adult 900 number on the
help screen of our app because I had
forgotten to document that it was just a
placeholder and somebody
I'm future Walter and I completely agree
with everything you just said i
President Walter over here forgot to
document the code and some of the
projects we've been working on and now I
can't seem to remember what we were
thinking Walter I'm so disappointed take
a look at some of your own older
projects can you remember everything
that you were thinking when you were
writing that code wouldn't it be helpful
to have a handy reference of all the
decisions that passed you made</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
