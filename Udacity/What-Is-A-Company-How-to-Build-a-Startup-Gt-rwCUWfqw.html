and customer development but you know
before we even begin one of the first
questions I tend to ask is what is a
company what is it that I'm trying to
actually start just for the sake of this
class I think we ought to use this
definition a company is a business
organization which sells a product or
service in exchange for revenue and
profit so explicitly for the purpose of
this class I'm in eliminating non
profits let me be clear you could use
the business model canvass and customer
development to go through the process
for nonprofits but actually having some
goals that are fairly concrete revenue
and profit allows us to measure whether
we're succeeding and failing in very
clear ways and that leads us to the
question what's a startup you told us
what a company has been how does a
start-up different and for me you have
to know I spent 20 years doing eight
startups and I never could have given
you a definition off the top my head
what a start-up is I always thought a
startup is where we had free food or
there was a great small team or you
could bring your dog and whatever but I
never quite understood the purpose of a
startup so I'm going to give you Steve's
definition of what it is you're actually
doing one is a startup is a temporary
organization designed to search for a
repeatable and scalable business model
now let's go back and parse the sentence
because this is pretty important number
one is temporary the goal of a startup
is not to be a start-up a startup
actually aims to become a company well
that's kind of interesting because if
you really think about it at least if
you're a web mobile startup there's no
such thing as a 10 year old startup
there's a two year old startup attached
to an eight year old failure a startup
is a temporary organization and what are
you supposed to be doing well while you
think it might be building the product
or maybe if you're thinking harder it
might be get customers actually no a
start-up is actually designed to search
for something well that's kind of
interest
what is it that I'm supposed to be
searching for let's see well number one
you want to search for something that's
repeatable and repeatable means the same
thing that works on Monday works on
Wednesday and works on Friday and works
next week in works the next month that
is I want to find sales and marketing
and engineering processes that are
repeatable I also want to find them
scalable what scalable means I put a
dollar in I get two dollars out or I put
a dollar in maybe I get ten dollars out
but I better not be losing money on a
continual basis or I'm called a out of
business startup okay I know I'm
searching now for something repeatable
and scalable but what is it that I'm
searching for and what you're searching
for is the business model and that
business model search is the basis of
the rest of the class so let's take a
look and see how we become a company</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
