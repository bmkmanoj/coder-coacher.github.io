want to get to the juicy bits but I need
to bother you once again with a bunch of
general advice so you don't shoot
yourself in the foot not all tools are
created equal and like you learned in
the quiz not all optimizations are worth
doing let's go through a few common
scenarios that set you up for failure
chances are you probably count and even
if you can it won't be worth it to give
you a web dev example hundreds of
engineering gears went into tiny Jas
libraries like jQuery including some of
my time actually and yet countless
developers have tried to replicate it
with a ninety percent similar feature
set only to fail hard again and again
even popular clones likes abdo couldn't
keep up when they realize that Jake we
fixed a lot more cross browser madness
than people thought even in modern
browsers
now we're talking idealistic versus
pragmatic yes that twenty percent speed
increase will be ideal but sticking to a
two letters well supported by the
community is pragmatic cope might be a
little slower than someone's else new
tool but you'll find answers for your
questions on stack overflow plugins for
virtually anything and can rest assured
that the tool is going to be maintained
by its graders don't just trust your
instincts but consider the long-term
value for your project
so it's neatly contained all in one
package sure well be careful with those
if a tool promises to do it all and
stays away from offering any sort of
connection point saying API on modules
run no seriously life is too short to
buy into an ecosystem that you can't
escape from especially if the success of
your site depends on it and finally you
should be careful with any micro
optimizations that are just not worth it
if you're doing an optimization of your
workflow that takes say four hours and
cuts a second away from a task you
perform once during the day you need to
do it for 40 years to justify the
investment and in 40 years you could be
sitting in an intergalactic flying car
exploring the outer realms of space
