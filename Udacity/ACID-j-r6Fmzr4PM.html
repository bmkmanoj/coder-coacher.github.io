like to cover before we move into some
actual programming and this is acid now
again like many of the concepts in this
in this lecture this is a very very
broad topic and we're just barely going
to scratch the surface but I want you to
be familiar with these concepts because
this is the type of language will be
using when we're building our system so
acid this stands for a for Adam icity
see for consistency I for isolation and
D for durability atomicity refers to the
notion that all parts of a transaction
succeed or fail together now we haven't
talked about transactions but these are
basically just a of a group of
statements so if we were updating our
database which is actually not something
we spent much time on there may be the
case we're updating two tables at once
or updating multiple rows in our
database together you know in one
cohesive unit for example if for working
from the reddit example if we had a link
table in a user's table and somebody up
voted on a link and that increases the
users reputation we might increase the
score of the link and also increase the
reputation of the user and those would
happen in something that's called a
transaction which groups together
multiple commands Adam icity refers to
the notion that either all of those
commands are going to succeed or they're
all going to fail but we don't just we
don't do part of it we don't have just
updating the link and not updating the
user everything happens together so this
is a nice property for a database to
have consistency refers to the notion
that the database will always be
consistent and to work from our reddit
example let's let's talk about this idea
where we have a link in a user who have
properties if we have this notion that a
link has a has a score that gets you
know updated periodically and the author
or the submitter of that link also has a
karma score that also gets updated at
the same time consistency refers to the
notion that both the score and the karma
will be consistent with one another so
that we don't you know update the score
without also updating the karma
basically means the database will move
from one valid transaction to the next
so we'll never you know run a query that
gets a links updated score but can't
also get the user
is updated karma so isolation refers to
the notion that no transaction can
interfere with another's so let's say we
have a link that is both getting you
know two votes coming at the same time
to increase the score of of this link
that means we're going to be updating
the link score up and down and the users
karma up and down and isolation refers
to the notion that this this up vote
won't affect the computation of this
down vote you know if we were over
writing this link in our database it
would be a shame if that the down vote
was applied to the original link score
before the up vote was supplied because
the net score changing here should be 0
but it could be negative 1 if these
aren't handled properly and so isolation
refers to the notion that each
transaction cannot affect other
transactions sometimes this is
accomplished through locking if two
transactions affect the same row only
one can go at a time and there are other
ways of resolving transaction and
conflicts like that isolation refers to
a databases ability to do that finally
we have durability their ability or
first the notion that once a transaction
is committed it won't be lost this means
that for example if we send an update to
our database and we update some rose and
the database says okay you know
successful that even if the database is
turned off or crashed crashes or is
unplugged we won't lose that data that
is durability one thing you know I'd
like to know i knows i know we
introduced a lot of new concepts in this
in this portion here but the important
takeaway from this is that when you're
when you're talking about different
database systems that you have different
trade-offs it's hard to be fully have a
database that's completely atomic it's
completely consistent all transactions
are isolated and it's completely durable
there's always some trade-offs</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
