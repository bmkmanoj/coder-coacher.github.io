have of online education is they suggest
that the kind of collaboration we can
have in person is difficult to do online
if you're taking an online class the
teacher can say hey get into groups and
discuss this topic or complete this
activity and you move your desks around
you move around in the lecture hall you
sit face-to-face with one another you do
something and then you break and go back
to the regular class and some people
point out that it's difficult to do that
online and even more so things like
group projects that are very valuable in
traditional education can also be
difficult to do when you can't meet in
person you can't gather around a table
and chat about ideas or or scribble on
paper and share it with one another so
how can we develop technology to lets
people actually collaborate on projects
or learning at a distance there's a
field that tries to address this called
computer-supported collaborative work it
tries to develop tools that allow people
to collaborate even when they're not
co-located in the same room but it's
actually not just about online learning
either it's not just focused on
developing tools that a lot of people to
collaborate when they're not co-located
it also tries to develop tools that make
collaboration easier in general I'm a
very simple example that can be
considered something of an instance of
computer-supported collaborative work is
Google Docs
that's a document interface let's
multiple people edit the same document
at the same time if you've done anything
before Google Docs came along you
probably remember the days when you had
to pass a document around amongst people
and tell who was doing the edits at a
given time and control for versions and
do a lot of headache eat things like
that but with Google Docs we can all log
into the same document the same time
collaborate on it and move on so
computer-supported collaborative work is
not just about learning together not
just about collaborating on learning
activities it's also about collaborating
via computers in general but in this
class we're going to really talk about
how we can use technology to enable
collaboration in the context of
education</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
