problem but there are lots of other
situations where we need to commit to
values and we need to commit to values
much longer than just one bit and for
that we need something a little more
versatile but with the same idea what we
need for this is what's called a
cryptographic hash function it's a
function that has this property that it
takes some large value as an input and
outputs a small value so this is similar
to a regular hash function like we used
in a hash table has the property that
map's values from a large input domain
and by large here we usually mean
infinite such as all possible strings of
any length to a small fixed output size
it should also have the property that
it's well distributed that for any given
input the probability that that input
maps to a particular value is close to 1
over the size of the table and we'll use
in to represent the output size so we'll
say that outputs are in the range from 0
up 10 minus 1 and so if it has this well
distributed property well this works
great for a hash table this is not
enough for cryptographic commitments if
we just have these two properties well
it might be easy to find other x-values
that map to the same thing and we saw
that one of the things that we need for
a cryptographic hash function is to make
it hard for Alice to be able to do that
otherwise she could find two inputs and
cheat in the coin tossing game this
first property of mapping a large input
domain to a small fixed output will call
compression what we need for a
cryptographic hash function is three
additional properties the properties are
preimage resistance which means given
the output of the hash function it's
hard to find the input that produced it
this is a form of one-wayness two other
two properties we need concern the
collision resistance the weakest form of
this is known as weak collision
resistance
what weak collision resistance means is
that if we're given some hash value it's
hard to find any input that hashes to
the same result these are sort of
similar right this one says it's hard to
find the actual value of X that was used
this one says it's hard to find any x
prime value that hashes to that value if
we have weak collision resistance that
would imply we have a form of
image resistance as well and the final
property is strong collision resistance
which is exactly the one we saw that we
needed for the coin tossing game and
strong collision resistance requires
that it's hard to find any pair x and y
such that the hash of x is equal to the
hash of y so have we seen anything that
can do this and the question is which of
these is almost a good cryptographic
hash function and I'm using almost here
and somewhat of a fuzzy way but I want
you to select the one that seems closest
to being a good cryptographic hash
function none of them is a perfect
cryptographic hash function and we'll
discuss that more after the quiz so here
the choices use cipher block chaining
mode to encrypt X and then take the last
output block as the value of the hash
the second choice is to use counter mode
to encrypt X and then take the last
output block the third choice is to use
electronic codebook mode to encrypt X
and then take all the output blocks XOR
them all together and use the result as
the hash value and the fourth choice is
to use counter mode to encrypt X XOR
together all that put blocks and that's
the hash value which one of these makes
the most sense to provide the
cryptographic hash function properties
that we need</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
