optionals using question marks and we
focused on safe ways to unwrapped
optionals using question marks and if
let statements now it's time to get a
little reckless and start working with
exclamation points unwrapping optionals
with exclamation points requires a lot
more confidence in your code if you try
to unwrap a nil value with an
exclamation point
yikes - unwrap an optional in this
carefree manner place an exclamation
point after the variable but if the
value inside is nil it explodes okay
nothing explodes but it does throw a
fatal error there's no safe way to
unwrap with an exclamation point when
you choose to unwrap with an exclamation
point you're saying that you want the
program to crash if the value inside is
now it communicates to your code readers
that you're confident there will not be
a nil value in the optional we can also
declare optionals with an exclamation
point much the way we did with question
marks but this optional is different
it's implicitly unwrapped that means
that when this optional is used in an
expression it'll automatically unwrap it
is an optional so it can store a value
or nil but it's as if it's a very
fragile wrapped package that immediately
falls open when it's picked up because
we don't unwrap it carefully if there's
a nil value inside bad things can happen
a fatal error can be thrown so in what
scenarios would it be appropriate to use
such a volatile optional let's look at a
couple examples let's say we're using
our old friend the int initializer
method and invoking it on a variable
that we're confident can be converted to
an int we know this method is going to
return the int 123 so in this case
unwrapping with an exclamation point is
appropriate we know there's little risk
of an error being thrown so we can place
the exclamation point after W like this
or we could unwrap the return value
directly like this in this second case
the value assigned to W will be a plain
old int what about declaring implicitly
unwrapped optionals when is an
appropriate time to be so bold well
remember the button property on our view
controller we know that this button
property will be nil when the view
control
created so we know it needs to have an
optional type we can also be confident
that this button property will be set by
storyboard in that case it should be
okay to unwrap this property
automatically and declare it with an
exclamation point it is possible for
this to backfire here's what it looks
like in an Xcode project if we try to
use the button but it hasn't been
initialized again the problem here is
that we're accessing the button in order
to get the title for state but the
button doesn't exist yet you can get a
fatal error this is why one has to be
careful and only try to access an
implicitly unwrapped optional in a case
like this when you know the button will
be there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
