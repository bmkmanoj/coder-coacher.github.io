exercises will be in JavaScript even if
you don't know JavaScript you should be
able to get through the first few
exercises without too much difficulty
your goal in this exercise will be to
draw a square to start with you have to
create a geometry object which allows
you to add vertices to it which lets you
mix the triangles and squares and so on
so this geometry object will consist of
vertices along with the face vertices
are the corners of a polygon usually a
triangle once we create our geometry
object we add vertices by pushing them
onto the array basically push means add
to the end of an array and JavaScript
keeps track of how large the array is
and so on you don't have to worry about
allocating space for it and these are
our three vertices we use vector three
for both points and vectors within three
j/s within this library so these are
floating-point numbers in fact and
define three points in x y&amp;amp;z coordinates
a geometry object also has faces in it
by using a face three we define three
different vertices that we're going to
make a single face out of in other words
we're going to define a triangle the way
face indices work is they point to the
various vertices in the array so this is
vertex zero
we always start counting from zero
vertex one and vertex two and by listing
out those indices 0 1 and 2 so these are
integers that says this triangle has
this this in this vertex</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
