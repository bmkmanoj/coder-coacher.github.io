optimization problem so remember when we
talked about optimization we worried
about configurations I think we call
them inputs at the time but I think it's
going to be helpful to think of them as
as configurations here there was a way
of scoring configurations and we were
trying to find configurations that had
high score and for some of the
algorithms we needed a notion of a
neighborhood so that we could move from
configuration to configuration trying to
improve mm-hmm so in this setting the
configuration the thing that we're
optimizing over is the partitions the
clusters and we also have this kind of
auxiliary variable of where the center's
are for those clusters and what we need
now is a notion of scores how do we
score a particular clustering so do you
have any thoughts about what would be a
better or worse clustering according to
the kind of k-means algorithm well if I
think about what you were saying earlier
about what we were trying to do with
creating these clusters and I look at
this notion of a center so something
pops in my head so you would like to
have sinners or partitions that somehow
are good representations of your data
and why does that matter because you
said in the very beginning that we often
think of unsupervised learning as
compact representation so if you want to
have a compact representation it would
be nice if you don't throw anything away
so I'm gonna say that a good score would
be something that captures just how much
error you introduce by representing
these points as partitions or in this
case as centers does that make sense
okay yeah I guess that's a that's a
perfectly reasonable way to think of it
another way to think of it is in terms
of error right yeah which I guess is the
same idea that I get for if you think
about the object as being represented by
the center of its cluster mm-hmm then we
want to know how far away from the
center it is right in the farther away
it is the more error you have in
representing it right so here's a
concrete way of writing down what we
think the scoring function could be so
we're gonna say that the error it's kind
of the negative score right this is
something that we want to minimize
even though generally we've been talking
about optimization is maximizing here's
something we want to minimize if you
give me a particular way of clustering
it and you define the center's based on
say that cluster
we're going to do is we're going to sum
over all the objects the distance the
squared distance actually between the
object and its center right so P of X is
the cluster for X and center sub that is
the center for that cluster so that
drives home the idea that we're talking
about Euclidean distance here because X
would have to be in the same space as
the center's are by definition okay yeah
and I'm not sure exactly how we're going
to define neighborhood but one way to
define neighborhood is that the
neighborhood of a configuration which is
a P in a center is the set of pairs
where you keep the centers the same and
you change the partitions or you keep
the partitions the same and you move the
center's so you're basically changing
one of these at a time oh that's very
clever Michael Thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
