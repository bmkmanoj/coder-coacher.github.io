the service lead for you to ask these
robotics in another degree program and
I'm here with assistant professor in
robotics at the University of Bristol
Bristol robotics and president and
co-founder of Robo hubs Sabine Howard
Sabine how are you I'm great how are you
Mike I'm doing well thank you
I was wondering if we could talk a
little bit about the theory of swarm
robotics and swarm intelligence so being
what is swarm intelligence so if you
look at birds and ants and bees they can
do these beautiful complex behaviors so
for example you've probably seen flocks
in the sky you've probably seen ants go
to your picnic table and you might know
that bees can make decisions about where
they create their their nests next and
these are swarm behaviors and the way
they work is that each agents whether
they're a bird or B or ants just looking
at their local neighborhood or their
local environment and following a simple
set of rules can give rise to these
swarm behaviors which which are emergent
behaviors so it's all about figuring out
how the agents behave in a very simple
manner to get these complex behaviors
and that's warm intelligence so that's
really interesting so we're saying then
a biological beam that that's kind of
primitive in nature is able to kind of
be able to carry out a more complex task
when they work together that's the
thinking it's more than the sum of their
parts so by working together swarms
aren't able to achieve these complex
behaviors
I know answer a particular interest of a
lot of researchers and know even dating
back you know a couple of decades ago
where they were looking at the trails of
ants and how ants communicate along
these trails to kind of find food
sources or to carry out different types
of tasks would you be able to speak a
little bit more about some of the
behavior that we've seen in ants and how
some of these things potentially are
modelled yeah sure it's really
interesting to think about how ants do
things like creating these trails to
food sources in nature so they're quite
good at finding these food sources and
adapting their trail so that they can
find the shortest trails to the food
sources and different ant colonies have
different types of trails and the way
they do that is there
process called sigmaji which means
communication through the environments
and the general idea is that ants as
they explore their environment they
leave the nest they deposits chemicals
called pheromones as they go and other
amps can sense those pheromones and can
choose to follow paths with highest
pheromones for example this pheromone
evaporates over time as well and by
following simple rules of depositing
pheromone fencing Caramoan following
those paths with pheromone with certain
probability and having pheromone
evaporate you get trails that emerge and
it's been quite interesting to use some
of these rules for the robotics in the
computer science world so for example
there's a thing called ant colony
optimization which takes inspiration
from what the natural ants are doing for
example route packets through a network
in my case I have been studying how we
can use ants like rules to deploy
networks of flying robots to create
communication systems outdoors and there
again we use principles where robots had
to sense what pheromone levels were on
other robots and follow those paths and
over time we could create trails for
example between rescuers that needed to
communicate here this network so there's
a number of rules that we've learned
from biologists and that we can use then
in the engineering world it's also
interesting to chat to biologists
because obviously it's not that simple
many different ant colonies many
different strategies that emerge and I
was traveling with with Nigel Frank's
who's who's a big researcher on the
outside in terms of the biology and so
we were talking about these pheromones
and how they create these trails and
actually if you take smaller colonies it
doesn't make sense for them to
communicate using chemicals and so they
can't come up with another strategy
these ants is once they figured out
where the food sources are they actually
go back to their nest and carry the ants
there so obviously the biological world
is much more complex but that just seems
there's so many more ideas that we can
then use in the realm of engineering
that's a really interesting way of doing
the communication by picking
my aunt and actually bringing it back is
it because the ant itself has emitted
some sort of trail that or a scent that
it knows or is just because of memory
placement that it knows to kind of carry
back and forth to that's that same food
source
yeah it's unclear I mean if you have
many many ants then you somewhat have
critical mass where you can start
communicating through the environment by
by depositing it sensing these
pheromones it could be if you have a
smaller quality you don't have critical
mass and so your pheromones would just
evaporate all the time so your your ants
would get lost
so that means to a certain extent if you
have fewer ends maybe these ants need to
be smarter individually in that they
might need some way to navigate their
environment without these pheromones and
then then it wouldn't make sense to
carry the other ants there as well right
because we have that information in so
you want to show another ant how to do
that but obviously it's much much more
complex so why they do it is it's not
entirely clear to me it's a really
interesting problem I mean if you think
about a smaller colony being able to do
something you would need a lot more
autonomy between each individual and a
lot more capability then as your colony
grows you can actually delegate a lot of
that work and then be able to you know
achieve the same task with a much lower
level of intelligence yeah that's that's
something I'm fascinated by right now so
in in our lab there are small swarms or
for example the swarm I did my PhD with
was ten flying robots and there's large
swarms you have a thousand robots in the
lab as well and the complexity of the
individual robots so what they can do is
very different depending on how many you
have because if you want to make a
thousand they need to be cheap and they
ate it they end up be noisy and so they
end up being a little bit less reliable
but you have more of them and I love
playing around with what algorithms work
when you reach huge numbers given that
your individuals are a little bit
simpler or what algorithms work when you
have fewer robots knowing that each
individually is maybe a little bit
smarter but you don't have those massive
numbers and I really think that the
strategies that you use are completely
different and so it's it's fun to think
about how you swarm across skills and
actually meet you maybe have some good
ideas yeah yeah talking about
the idea of swarming in terms of robots
what kind of sensors would you use to
kind of be able to dictate that kind of
behavior it really depends what you're
trying to achieve so the key is you want
to have information about your local
environments so your local environment
can be robots in your neighborhood in
which case usually want some form of
communication and that can be Wi-Fi I
know there's a number of ways you can do
virtual communication or you might want
to be able to sense your environment
so whatever sensor allows you to sense
your environments but it really depends
on the types of applications that you're
looking in your environment in most of
these cases is the environment kind of
unstructured in the sense that you don't
really know where you are in the
environment from an environment or an
overview perspective so there's no
cameras or anything that are kind of
watching this behavior it's more of the
behaviors more localized on the agent
itself kind of moving around or is there
both types of situations well in the
world it's warming the whole point of
doing swarm behaviors but there is no
leader or godly figure that has an
overall view of what's happening and the
reason that's an advantage is that
because there is no leader these systems
can scale to much larger numbers they
only heat local information and simple
rules so you could theoretically achieve
huge numbers of agents and they're more
robust because there's no single point
of failure so those are the reasons we
do swarming this ability to be robust
and scalable and to have these emergent
properties in reality in the lab in our
environments you obviously monitor what
these forms are doing so that we can
have a better understanding really the
puzzle in swarm engineering is that
typically you know what swarm behavior
you want to achieve you might want your
robots to flock or make decisions or
create trails or do something clever in
an application but typically you don't
know exactly how to design those
individual behaviors it's very
non-obvious
to go between the individual behaviors
to what the swarm does as a whole and so
we need these experimental setups where
you do have an environment where you can
see what the swarm is doing so that we
can troubleshoot that and try lots of
different individual
behaviors and see if they're doing the
right swarm behavior so that we can
engineers these so this whole process of
swarm engine engineering in the lab at
least just required us to have this
whole infrastructure set up so in the
practical standpoint though you wouldn't
want to have this overview you want to
be able to kind of allow these robots to
autonomously self organize and kind of
be able to achieve a task without having
an overview of that system at all is
that the goal I think eventually here so
there there's really two ways to think
about the swarm deployments one is that
in general you would want to find a good
way for humans to interact with swarms
so that they do have oversight over what
these robots are doing and that's
actually a whole area of research how
are we going to interact with swarms so
that we get feedback about what the
emerging behavior is is it that you can
see the whole swarm and so you can just
see what they're doing and you're happy
with that is it that the information
about what they're doing
somehow is shared amongst the swarm so
you could pick up a robot and that robot
would tell you what the swarm as a whole
is doing so that's that's a question
we're trying to figure out the other way
to approach this is say ok well swarms
have emergent properties and so they are
going to through local interactions and
huge numbers achieve ideally the
behavior you want because you've
engineered that's form to behave in the
way you've wants but we need to make
sure that that system has it has a
graceful degradation if it's not
performing what it was was supposed to
do so for example are these robots
really minimal are they small are they
safe are they potentially biodegradable
or disposable so that if the swarm is it
was not exactly performing what you
wanted to do in non safety critical
missions then that's perfectly fine it
was engineered to behave in that way so
there's really two fronts one is how can
we interact with swarms so that we
understand what they're doing and the
other is how can we design the swarm in
such a way that actually they were built
to just go out and do what they were
meant to do and maybe degrade or or by
you know be disposed and that would be
fine as well so it depends what they're
meant to be doing I see really kind of
an interesting problem I think when we
start talking about the idea of the
self-organization
kind of giving really basic rules
obviously there's some sort of time
lapse that has to occur before you can
actually ramp up and that actually have
that swarm behavior I would imagine that
you would if I look at it just from a
particle standpoint basically what you
do is you have a bunch of particles that
are kind of randomly moving all over the
place and some sort of just unstructured
motion and over time these particles
start to kind of you know self-organize
and start achieving a goal or moving in
unison how long does it take
during robot simulations to kind of see
that behavior emerge it really depends
so there's two problems one is once you
know the rules how long does it take for
in one simulation these rules to give
rise to a desired swarm behavior and
that that'll depend on the swarm
behavior you're trying to achieve you're
right it's not immediate these things
because they're the result of local
interactions between lots of agents they
take time to bubble up for you to
actually see what emergent behavior is
arising and there's another time
question which is more relevant which is
how do we discover the right swarm
behavior for a given application and
that actually takes much much longer
before we get it right and that's that's
what the bulk of my research at least
then so way the way I solved this puzzle
between what's the right rules for a
desired swarm behavior is part looking
at what biologists do and now obviously
takes them years of research to come up
with rules and then when they have them
we can test them and see what happens on
our artificial systems the other
strategy is trial and error and that's
typically lots and lots of tests and
rules that we know about and seen if
they work now we can kind of ramp that
up using crowdsourcing so having lots of
people help us design rules for robot
swarms and the other the final way which
I really like is using machine learning
so we did a lot of artificial evolution
to automatically come up with swarm
behaviors and so the reason it takes
time for us to discover these rules
using machine learning is typically
we'll for example with artificial
evolution you'll start with a random
swarm program and then you'll test it on
the robots and you're right it takes
time
for the behavior to emerge so every
simulation takes a little bit of time
and then based on what we've learned
we're going to change the program a
little bit and so you keep changing the
program until you find the rules that
gives you the right swarm behavior and
tax should be reached that point takes
takes time both in terms of machine
learning but also in terms of running
each one of these simulations that being
said even though these behaviors take
time to emerge ideally there's a time
gain by using many robots so if you
think of a farm fields kilometer by a
kilometer farm fields there's there's
around 100 million seeds within that
farm fields and the way we would
typically plant those seeds using a
robot might be to have a tractor that
zigzags through that farm fields and
takes a certain amount of time but maybe
a swarm of I don't know biodegradable
robot seeds could deploy much quicker
because there's many more of them so the
time it takes the behavior to emerge you
know it's not immediate but actually
overall it might compare better to a
single robot and needs to do everything
right and says the area gets larger and
larger for you to accomplish a task
having swarm robots is definitely more
advantageous because you would be able
to cover as many things as as quickly as
possible so if speed is really your
objective in this case you could send
out a bunch of robots to kind of plant
seeds in a larger field then it would
for the amount of time it would take for
a tractor to kind of cigs AGG back and
forth and drop each seed one by one area
coverage is definitely an area where
swarms make sense where you have huge
areas whether it's for creating
communication networks or doing
something within these environments or
sensing or exploration those are all
things that frankly we can't do very
well with one or two robots and where we
wouldn't need many robots and if we
could make many of these robots work
together in a more intelligent way
ideally there's a time game there I know
you mentioned is just a few minutes back
about the idea of working with
biologists to kind of study the models
of actual biological beans and using
that
emulate what you're doing in your robots
how important do you feel that iterative
cycle is of kind of viewing what a
biologist has done trying to implement
it in a robotic setting and kind of
taking that information back and
providing that back to the biologist
does that help both of you kind of
refine your models or is it more of the
one-way flow from a biologist to a robot
assist yeah it's a really neat feedback
loop so for example biologists have been
studying how to evolve cooperation so
what is it's a natural evolution that
gives rise to systems that cooperates
and actually the lessons that we learned
from that allowed us to evolve robots
that cooperate and by doing it on the
artificial systems we could also help
the biologists test hypotheses because
we could evolve things artificially it
was much quicker than involving them in
the biological world and so we could
help them come up with interesting ideas
of what was happening in nature and
that's definitely the case with a number
of swarm behaviors that we're looking at
just because with simple rules sometimes
when you achieve very cool behaviors
even if they have nothing to do with
biology sometimes we can say actually I
wonder if the ants do that or I wonder
if the bees do that and that gives them
a hypothesis to to work from so I really
like this feedback loop and and right
now we're working as well with synthetic
biologists when denier for example
bacteria to do interesting things and so
it's a nice crossover between how we
engineer robots and how you'd engineer
bacteria and how we can make systems
that's warm so it's really interesting
to kind of hear about bacteria being
modeled inside of robotics is there any
other applications for something like I
don't know let's say like medicine we're
using some sort of particles to kind of
give treatments or doses to a patient
yes after after my PhD designing swarms
of flying robots I realized that there
were only only ten in the air it was
exciting but it was ten robots and then
my mind swarms needed to work in much
larger numbers and the hundreds of the
thousand and so I got really excited
about the area of nano medicine and I
spent three years of the lab at MIT that
makes nanoparticles for for cancer
treatments and what fascinates me things
nanoparticles come in the
to the power 13 so that was a huge
number that I was looking for in terms
of using those particles for treatments
and those particles that they were
designing and some heat about Tesla also
had a number of interesting features so
you could change the size of the
particle and that changed how they move
you could decorate particles with
molecules that would allow them to stick
to cancer cells or self-assemble you
could load these particles with drugs
that you could release in a controlled
fashion and you can make them with
different materials that you could
activate for example using magnetic
fields are using lights so actually
depending on how you design these
particles you could change how they move
how they interact with other particles
have what they release in their
environments and and those were a lot of
the building blocks that we would use
for swarm robotics and so I'm I'm really
keen on understanding how things in the
medical world whether they're
nanoparticles whether they're bacteria
which naturally work in huge numbers how
we can engineer their behavior as a
collective just by tweaking the
individuals and I think that's that's a
pretty untapped territory actually where
we're swarm engineering could have a
pretty big impact how does your train of
thought change when you're having to
deal with something from so such a
smaller scale to a much larger scale it
doesn't so I'm my puzzle is how do you
go from an individual behavior to
desired swarm behavior so this process
of swarm engineering whether it's using
bio inspiration whether it's using
machine learning whether it's using
trial and error and crowdsourcing is the
same across skills what I do change is
my agents so they could be virtual
agents they could be robots
it could be bacteria they could be
nanoparticles and I think the key thing
there what did change in my thought
process is that in each one of these
situations I actually need to get my
hands dirty so with the flying robots I
needed to build with my colleagues the
robots and throw them in the air and see
what they were doing with the nano
particles we needed to make
nanoparticles and see them under the
microscope but once you get the grasp of
what agents do and how they in
tract with their neighbors and with
their environments that gives you the
building blocks that you need to go back
to your swarm engineering approach and
so it's just been it's really fun for me
to see how similar things are across
skills so for example in our nano
particle simulator we've had to simplify
a lot of the things that our particles
can do they can't compute at the same
level of the row as the robots they
can't go left and right just like my
robots can then much much simpler and by
simplifying what my agents can do we've
come up with really interesting
behaviors that still you know our bits
for me so they can still create
insinuation trails a little bit like
ants can create trails to your picnic
table there's some basic decision-making
algorithm there's some really neat
self-assembly disassembly and how you
can use that to change how they move and
because we've done that in the Nano
world in simulation we've been thinking
about well actually if we were to make a
thousand ten thousand robots that are
centimeter sized can we use those very
very simple principles that are simpler
than the ones that we used to use for
robots and does that help to scale to
those large numbers so we have demos
with the robots then following rules to
create trails and make those at like
trails but much much simpler and then
what we used to do and so I think we're
gonna find that there are principles
they do work across those scales and the
mechanism to discover these principles
are the same
what's different is how you get your
hands dirty and understanding what each
one of these systems says I'm also quite
excited by the biomechanical side I
think it's somewhat closer to
application so with our nanoparticle
work we talked with with people in the
medical fields with clinicians with bio
engineers and they have really really
basic questions such as what particle
makes my part of my you know my
treatment distribute correctly over a
brain tumor and that the question the
way you answer that question is to
figure out what the right individual
nanoparticle design is is it a bigger
particle is it a particle with the
charge is it a particle that sticks to
the cancer cells and those are things
that actually if we find the answers now
using using swarm engineering approaches
those could have an imp
hacked near-term just in terms of
understanding with the collective of
those 10 to the power 13 particles do so
I'm quite excited by the application in
the biomedical field because they need
answers about how all these systems work
together already so having the benefit
of using swarms that kind of deploy
medicine for tumor or cancer cells what
are other applications do you see for
kind of these nanoparticles to kind of
in this warm environment to kind of
distribute help or aid in the medical
profession yes I think cancer is the one
I focused on just I needed to learn the
whole area of cancer before I could
really dive in in general many
biological systems that are relevant for
health involve many actors working
together whether you look at the immune
system or you look at the microbiome and
if we can understand for example how a
biofilm forms in the area of
antimicrobial resistance well if you
understand how it forms maybe you could
disrupt and maybe you can control and
engineer it so I think there's a large
number of biomedical challenges which
involves many things working together we
need a better understanding and we need
a better way to control and the control
is really the new thing I think there's
many people trying to understand these
systems but it's fun to think about how
you'd engineer and control them if you
could and I'm hoping that some of the
techniques that we're using could could
be applicable there but we always need
expertise in those different areas to
really make an impact I'll just cross
disciplinary do you feel like swarm
engineering and swarm robotics is do do
you feel that it really requires a large
knowledge of biology and engineering and
chemistry or is it you know is there
some sets of skills that you would kind
of focus more heavily on it's really
cross-disciplinary but I think it's up
to everyone to figure out what
application area you want to work in and
then go ahead and learn it so if you
look at my team my students come from
biomedical engineering from physics from
aerospace from robotics from electrical
engineering computer science they come
from right
of backgrounds and the reason they come
from all those backgrounds is not
because they're working specifically in
their area but just because I like to
have lots of people from different areas
to feed into this process of engineering
swarms so for those who are working with
bacteria for example well yes they need
to spend time learning how you engineer
bacteria and how they work and how you
can see them at those scales and how you
can model them and those working on with
robots are most more focused on robots
you don't necessarily need to know the
whole spectrum but you can come into
this field from a variety of backgrounds
have you seen a lot of success
implementing a single algorithm across
multiple different disciplines in terms
of objectives that you're trying to
reach there's many basic principles sort
of building blocks of swarming that you
see over and over again so if you look
at it flocking if you look at what ants
are doing if you look at what these are
doing at least didn't in terms of how we
use them it's form intelligence
typically you're exchanging information
with your neighbors you're either
attracted to them or you're repulsed
from them you're there depositing
something in the environment and that's
something in the environment by either
attractive or repulsive you're
exchanging information with your
neighbors and you're trying to sample
what your neighborhood is seyd and based
on that you change your stage or you
change your decision so there's a number
of building blocks that that do pop up
as you try the engineer swarm behaviors
and they're used across the number of
swarm behaviors and so sometimes it
sounds like it should be simple to
engineer swarms because once you see the
rules are like well yeah that's that's
obvious that's how you would create a
trail to your picnic table but actually
just having the building blocks doesn't
doesn't actually tell you how to
engineer these swarm behaviors so there
are basic principles that are used over
and over again but actually you still
need to really tune them in and
re-engineer the swarm behavior when you
think of the new application let's see
outside of the area of nano medicine is
there any other areas of small for swarm
robotics that you see that would be
particularly interesting on the larger
scale and
quite excited about what we could be
doing in swarm robotics so we're already
seeing smaller robot swarms being used
so if you look at aerial of robots there
are good examples of how you you know
you could have multiple robots work
together so for example if you look at
the entertainment side you might have
seen at the Super Bowl all these really
needs quad rotors that were flying about
lady gaga
that's one example where we're starting
to see many robots that work together
I'd say in terms of applications there's
been a big push towards multi robot
systems so not necessarily swarms
because it's not all emergent and
self-organized the multi robot systems
where you need multiple robots for a
specific application so for example that
could be flying robots and ground robots
and underwater robots that are working
together in a rescue mission
or it could be robots like those that
you find in the Amazon warehouses so if
you look at Amazon robots those
typically work in a thousand plus within
a warehouse environment but it's much
more controlled and typically there is a
central system a god we figured that
tells every robot what to do and how to
behave so those have been much more
successful at going towards real world
applications right now and I think it
makes sense because we finally have
individual robots that are rolling
outside of the lab and we're trying to
figure out how to get more than one work
together in terms of the real swarm
robots up until now we we've been very
lab based and what's exciting on that
front is that we can finally do
experiments in the lab that involve a
thousand plus robots and that's thanks
to write a command file system of
kilobots with Mike Rubinstein that
allows us to do experiments with a
thousand robots and we're just starting
to see what algorithms work with those
numbers and how we could use those in
outdoor applications but my hope now on
something that we're focusing on is how
do you take those robots that work in
the thousands and make an outdoor
version of them because the applications
there are things like the planting seeds
I mentioned before but also
environmental monitoring could you
quickly deploy these
wotz over an area and they sense
something interesting in that
environment and bring that information
back to you could you use them anything
where you need large areas which we
currently can't do very well and those
are places where I want to see robots
forms being used one of the things that
I think about generally when I start
thinking about swarm robotics and some
of the applications is I tend to think
of them more from the monitoring side of
things because I tend to think of them
as very kind of primitive and being able
to kind of more just collect information
than it is really to act upon that
information do you feel that the first
real major deployment of swarms in an
industry setting are going to be more on
the side of being passive meaning just
kind of grabbing information and
reporting it back or do you think it's
gonna be more active in the sense of
taking that information and kind of
moving forward collectively as a group
to kind of solve a task I think that's a
good first step for sure but there's
only a step from that actually creating
a Wi-Fi network or depositing something
in the environment of cleaning up an oil
spill so I think it helps to think of
these systems is actually doing
something meaningful in their
environment and what that something is
will depend depend on the application
but you're right deploying them and
sensing something it's a good a good
first step now I know we're talking
about a lot of different groups here and
we're talking about a lot of
cross-disciplinary studies and work I
mean obviously at your lab you're saying
you have robot assist engineers
electrical engineers
other types of people biologists as well
how important is it that these groups
kind of communicate together and how
important is it for them to make sure
that the communication the language that
you use differs typically from field to
field just slightly and it's enough that
sometimes it can cause confusion when
talking to another field for instance
some words might mean have one
definition in terms of biology but when
you're talking to a roboticist it might
mean something slightly different I know
in reinforcement learning computer
science is the way that they view
reinforcement learning is slightly
different than a psychologist how
important is it that we have this
communication and it's broad sense of
understanding of everybody's field to
kind of make sure that we're
collaborating correctly
so the way we do it is we have swarm
lunches and we force everyone to explain
what they're doing to the other people
who aren't necessarily exactly in the
same fuse because you're right that
there are very different languages so
going from swarms of flying robots to
nanomedicine required essentially
learning a new an entirely new language
to be able to get to the point where we
were making progress and what we wanted
to do and I think the key there is very
often people think of cross-disciplinary
as to two different disciplines coming
together and I'm much more keen on on
creating cross-disciplinary people so
the reason we always get our hands dirty
as in we'll make a model simulation
discover a swarm behavior but then we'll
actually implement it it's because I
think that's one of the only ways to
make cross-disciplinary people they need
to be a little bit uncomfortable as they
go along so that their algorithm they'll
see that it doesn't work at all when
they test it in reality and then they
need to actually approach the people in
those Able's figure out why it hasn't
worked in reality and then to do that
they need to learn language at some
point if everyone is doing that within a
team you somehow end up with a common
base language that allows you to
communicate and then there's the details
that sometimes get lost but actually
those details sometimes shouldn't be
communicated in the way that they get
lost and you know the students get into
a habit of not using all this jargon if
they realize that the person across the
aisle has no idea what they're talking
about so it's I think it's it's super
fun to create cross-disciplinary
environments not just having different
disciplines but people who cross
disciplines
it's a it's a fun thing to do it's a
hard thing to do because very often
Society and research and would not
values expertise and meesh areas and I
would love for us to celebrate more
people who are cross-disciplinary that's
sit on these edges or in between these
different cubes because that didn't have
itself this skill I think it's really
helpful for people I feel like that's
something that we're moving more and
more towards these days is the ability
to be able to be good in multiple fields
and not just one anymore I think there
was a point in time it was very simple
to say that you were good at Electrical
Engineering and that was kind of your
area you were good at coding and that
was your area you
good at math and that was your area but
it seems like as as things have evolved
even in the scientific community as a
whole it's not good enough to be good at
just electrical engineering anymore or
just good at mechanical engineering or
good just good at physics you have to be
able to kind of you know blend these
boundaries together and kind of say well
I'm really a physicist at heart but I
can do some electrical engineering as
well or I'm a really good mathematician
but I'm also a pretty good computer
scientist I think as we kind of see this
world blend together do you think we're
going to see more and more of kind of
like almost like these cross
specializations start to emerge and are
these going to be helpful do you think
for the in particular in the field of
robotics words it's so
cross-disciplinary
yeah I really I really hope so I think
it's valuable for two reasons one
because of the new discoveries you make
because you're sitting in the space
that's potentially unexplored the other
is because it allows you to be able more
flexible in what you want to do or what
you want to study and so if you're used
to moving across boundaries then then
your helps you're not held back as much
in terms of exploring completely new
things so when my colleague was talking
about synthetic biology I was like oh
yeah we should explore that we should do
that and I think it's much easier to do
if you're if you've lot somehow your
home base and you've already started to
explore the world or the different
disciplines and and I think the more we
can do that more will make really
exciting discoveries so there's this
interesting notion I feel from being an
expert in an area and kind of slowly
exploring another area where you're so
used to being so knowledgeable about
your area so well and you have so much
expertise in one particular topic that
once you start to merge into another
area all of a sudden you realize that
there's this whole huge learning curve
that you're about to face again of
trying to get ramped up in that that new
area what are some of the techniques or
what are some of the some advice that
you would give to some people out there
who are interested in exploring another
area but are getting kind of discouraged
right away with the amount of
information that that's kind of in front
of them that they have to digest so the
way I did so I was playing around with
these flying robots for my PhD and I
thought everything
medicine so I picked up the most
complicated book I could and read all
about cancer for I don't know whatever
time it took me to finish that huge book
and I didn't understand a word of it
frankly it was just sort of a way from
to immerse myself in the language that
they were using and the key thing for me
was to actually go to eleven so so I was
lucky that's thing too you betcha
over at MIT actually said oh you want to
do swarmy nanoparticle oh yeah sure
that's fine come along kind of need
someone to take a risk on you so that
you can immerse yourself in the
environment that you want to learn it's
a little bit like learning a new
language right the best place to learn
it is to actually go to the place where
they speak that language so spending
time there with pretty much the I think
the best way to figure out how this new
discipline works but I also think you
need to to keep an expertise not just
jump from field to fields so my key
expertise is more of engineering and I
do that across scales for a number of
different agents and it's actually
advice wrapped Andrea gave me is you
need to be an expert in something and so
that's my expertise and I take that with
me so that I don't start from scratch
every time I tackle a new type of scale
or a new type of agents and that allows
me to have something that's reassuring
something that I have been studying you
know for we're over a decade and that I
can fall back to I'm just using it in
new and interesting ways so having this
sort of foothold the thing that you're
confident abounds but then pushing
yourself to go into these these
different directions I think is at least
what helps what helps me yeah great
when trying to break into the field of
swarm engineering or study the field of
swarm engineering what do you feel are
some of the most crucial skills that
somebody could have it helps to know how
to it really depends so it really
depends because depending on what your
background is you can come at it from
different angles if you're good in math
you can you know you can do the maths of
how these systems are organized if
you're good in computer programming you
can start to create simulations where
you start to see robots that interact
and can you program them in a way they
achieve a desired swarm behavior I
you're good at hardware you can start to
think of okay well actually if I'm gonna
make a outdoor form of a thousand robots
how should I should I build that robot
and what are you know what are the
mechanical components so that it can go
over rough terrain and what is the
sensing so that it can send its local
environment and communicate with its
local neighborhood if you're good in
biology you could say actually what what
kind of interesting behaviors are
animals doing and if I studied that
would that be helpful for the swarm
robotics world if you're into chemistry
you could say actually we're gonna need
to make these robots outdoors but
working huge numbers they're gonna need
to be biodegradable what new materials
would be useful for these robots so
there there is no one way to approach
swarm robotics I think we need all of
these expertise and the key thing that
unifies us I think is a problem so if we
can figure out you know one thing that
they're trying that we're trying to
solve one application area and I think
that's where we can start to say okay
I'm gonna try to tackle this problem
what can my discipline bring to this
question and then use that as a starting
point so what problems that exist right
now that are kind of unopened that are
challenging for a swarm roboticist so
there's the biomedical field that I
mentioned do you mean just in terms of
the theory just in terms of just on
either side either the practicality or
the theory so I'm sure there's there's a
lot of interesting problems cuz I've
heard it both ways from people who are
like swarm theory is swarm intelligence
swarm robotics is the next really big
area that's really going to take off we
see a lot of people in academia kind of
study in this area and I think there's
some really interesting work and
interesting research that's coming out
of it however you can talk to some
people in the field and they'll say
swarm robotics really there really isn't
too much of an application for it in the
real world and I know a lot of people
like to do it in the lab but we haven't
really seen that really cross over yet
so so from your perspective what are
some of the interesting places that you
can apply swarm theory or some of the
challenges of applying swarm theory in
the next 5-10 years our real challenge
is that we need to make swarm robotics
real so a lot of it is done in the
laboratory if you think of the robot
scale and we need to figure out how to
do this outdoors so that means we need
to build robot platform
that work outdoors in large numbers and
we need to discover algorithms that were
working those large numbers and we need
to make sure that our robots are safe by
design maybe biodegradable a disposable
so we need to be clever about how we
design the materials themselves so
there's still a many research challenges
along those fronts on the biomedical
side I think we're actually closer to
application because even if you don't
make bacteria or nanoparticles that's
warm there's really important questions
to answer about how collectives in these
systems operate so I think that's
actually that's actually a very good
application for swarm robotics if we
bring them to the micro nanoscale just
because the agents already exist at
those scales and they already work in
huge numbers and they're begging to be
controlled so that that's sort of where
I see sort of the near-term applications
but what we need to do the challenge is
making these things real great sabine
