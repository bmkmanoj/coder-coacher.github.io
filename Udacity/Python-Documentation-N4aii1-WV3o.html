could write the equivalent of a Watson
program or a CD program for your own
computer just imagine if you could talk
to your machine in terms of stories
simple stories but have just one
sentence stories like Ashok ate a frog
now we already seen how a machine can
make sense of this particular sentence
Ashok ate a frog we did that last time
but of course eat or ate can occur in
many many different ways and sentences
here are some of the other ways in which
I can use the verb eat Ashok ate out a
tire straw I could tell something was
really eating him that the sense of
eating him here is very different from
the sense of eating here there's no
physical object that is being eaten here
the manager were either in your losses
so now this is a very different notion
of eat the river gradually ate away at
the riverbank got another notion of eat
so just like we had in the previous
lesson take the word take which has so
many different meanings eat has so many
different meanings now when we were
discussing the world take we discussed
how we can use both the structure of
sentences as well as background
knowledge to disambiguate between
different interpretations of take we
could do something similar with eat we
could any omitted all the different
meanings of eat and then for each
meaning of eat we could ask ourselves
what is it about the structure of the
sentence and what is it about the
background knowledge that I have about
things like rivers and riverbanks which
tells me what the meaning of ate here is
to summarize this part if you were to
start talking to your machine in stories
in terms of simple stories designated by
a single sentence then one problem that
will occur is that words like ate or
take will have large number of meanings
and we have seen how your machine can be
programmed in such a way so as to
disambiguate between different kinds of
meanings for the same world now here is
a different problem that occurs consider
a number of stories again each story
here is designated by a single sentence
Ashok ate a frog should devour the Frog
Ashok consumed a frog Ashok ingested a
frog and so on several sentences here
and if you think about a little bit each
of these sentences is using a different
verb
but the meaning of each of these verbs
in this sentences there's pretty much
the same so that Ashok ingested a frog
or a shocked devoured a frog or a
showdown and a frog practically the same
thing happened in each case there was a
frog which was initially outside a
shark's body and then Ashok ate it up
and at the end if frog was inside a
shark's body in the Frog was dead and
Ashok was happy so the next challenge
becomes how can a machine understand
that the meaning of each of these words
here is exactly the same in a way this
problem is the inverse of the problems
that we had here here de parar was that
we had a single word like eat which had
got a lot of different meanings in
different contexts in different
sentences here the issue is that we have
a lot of different words but they have
the same meaning given the context of
the sentences so another question then
becomes well how can we make machines
understand that the meaning of these
words in the sentences is exactly the
same each of the sentences is telling us
exactly the same story there is one
other thing that is important here and
that is a notion of context one of the
hardest things in AI is how do we bring
context into account and both of these
cases context is playing an important
role on the left side context is playing
an important role because we understand
in the meaning of each is different in
these different sentences because the
context of eat is different here context
is playing a different role we
understand in the meaning of each of
these words as practically the same
because the context here is practically
the same a couple of quick
qualifications here first right now
we're dealing with stories that have
just one sentences very soon in the next
lesson we little bit stories which are
much more complicated which really have
a series of sentences for now just
simple stories the second is that here
is structural all of these sentences are
the same so structure practically tells
us something about the context but a
situation is lot more complicated the
cars off turn two sentences which have
very different kind of structures can
still have the same meaning so consider
these two stories Bob short bill and Bob
killed bill with a gun now had his
sentence structures are very different
but their interpretations and meaning
are the same bill was the one who got
killed
pop was the one who did the killing and
the killing was done by putting a bullet
into bill so the question now becomes
how can we build air agents that can
meaningfully understand stories like
this one and stories of the kind at Bob
sharp bill and Bob killed bill with a
gun one thing we could do is that for
each of these verbs here we could have a
frame like we had a frame for take so we
could have a frame for eight a frame for
devour a frame for consumer frame for
ingested and so on well we would have a
lot of frames then because there are
large number of verbs in the English
language or in any other modern language
perhaps we could do something different
perhaps we could look that there is a
similarity between the interpretation of
these things perhaps we could use the
same primitive action for each one of
them so when we talk in English language
we might use for communication purposes
all of these words but perhaps we could
build AI agents that have a single
internal representation for each one of
them what might that internal
representation look like we will call
that include representation a primitive
action each one of these is an action
but many ds actions are equivalent in
terms of our interpretation of those
actions let's see what these primitive
actions might look like</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
