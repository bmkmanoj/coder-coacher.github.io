our odd ha and Roman data once again
each row has a number of columns such as
registrar enrollment agency state
district odd higher generated enrollment
rejected and a bunch of other
information if we want to count the
number of Aadhaar generated per district
the columns that were most interested in
our district and odd Hart generated can
you fill in the missing pieces of the
mapper so if we wanted to complete this
job using the MapReduce programming
model we would need to write a mapper
and reducer why don't you give it a try
here's the skeleton of a mapper for this
job we go through every single line in
the input in this case that's going to
be our CSV file containing all of the
rows in our Aadhaar generated data
you're going to have to go through each
line which will be a list of comma
separated values the header row will be
included tokenize each row using the
commas and omit a key value pair
containing the district and the number
of Aadhaar generated separated by a tab
make sure that each row has the correct
number of tokens and make sure it's not
the header row in order to count the
number of odd hard generated per
district using MapReduce we'll also have
to write a reducer here's the skeleton
of a reducer function that you'll fill
in we initialize odd Hart generated to 0
and set old key to none
you'll cycle through the list of key
value pairs emitted by your mapper and
print out each key once along with the
total number of Aadhaar generated
separated by a tab you can assume that
the list of key value pairs will be
ordered by key make sure that each key
value pair is formatted correctly before
you process it here's a sample final key
value pair Gujjar at tab 5.0</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
