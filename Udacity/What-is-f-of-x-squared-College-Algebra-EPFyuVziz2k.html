concept so fair warning this might be
confusing if you're totally good on this
awesome move forward if not you might
want to spend a little bit of extra time
trying to understand this concept since
we said that we can substitute in really
whatever we want in the place of X I can
actually substitute in a different
expression that involves an X so here we
have a function defined with X as the
independent variable and in the place of
that independent variable I can plug in
x squared for example remember that
these variables are really just
placeholders for us to plug in other
numbers that we know they can equal and
if we decide that we want to plug in x
squared we are totally entitled to do
that so how would you write out in
simplest terms what f of x squared is
and yes please remember to simplify as
much as you can</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
