Jonathan and Ryan of zipfian Academy
which is an immersive program for
students to learn all about data science
we're super excited to teach you guys
about data visualization and we want to
kick off this class with one simple
question
so Jonathan Ryan what is data
visualization great question Chris to me
data visualization is about conveying a
story or an idea as efficiently as
possible it's often said that a
picture's worth a thousand words and I
think data visualization works the same
way data scientists use data
visualization every day to explore
patterns in their data and so ultimately
convey the results so we're super
excited to share some of what we teach
our students with you today and Jonathan
what about you what do you think about
data visualization yeah so I think the
title of Edward Tufte 'is classic book
the visual display of quantitative
information actually gets at a core of
what many people think of as data
visualization simply how best to
represent visually some underlying data
using things like color size shape to
convey some information or some insight
to their audience and the reader and I
think it actually goes a little bit
further than that incorporating
storytelling and narrative elements like
Ryan mentioned to let the author of a
data visualization tell some interesting
insight they've discovered on their own
and they want to share with their
audience interesting thanks for sharing
that guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
