reproduction process first we need to
reproduce the environment in which the
bug occurs second way to reproduce the
steps required to reproduce the problem
both of these can be abstracted to input
all your program does is dependent on
its input therefore if you can reproduce
the input you can also reproduce the
execution but with that we already solve
the problem programs are nothing but
mathematical functions if they have the
same input they will produce the same
output right why is there actually a
problem of reproducing that's the
difference between theory and practice
in theory there is no difference in
practice there is at least that's the
theory indeed in practice the concept of
what makes input to program is very
variable we distinguish a number of
typical inputs each coming up with its
own issues we do have static data user
interaction time of day or january time
randomness that is randomness on purpose
we have the operating environment we
have schedules in particular for
parallel programs we have physical
influences and we do have debugging
tools all of these constitute input to
the program and each of these brings up
its own issues as it comes to
reproducing failures let's start with
regular static data in a bachelor ended
program these are the inputs that is the
files or documents your program
processes static data is the easiest to
reproduce because it can be handled as
an individual entity outside of your
program if your program operates on
files all you need to do is to ship the
data files if it works on a database
then stable instead this includes all
data that is under the control of the
user if it's under your control you
probably already know it so you clear
about the variable stuff for one thing
these are documents under the users
control as well as configuration files
in which users store their preferences
or the settings for the system at hand
obviously if you have all the documents
and the configuration files your program
operates the pond then it's fairly easy
to reproduce the exact problem however
a small catch with that just a tiny tiny
catch but this tiny tiny catch can
become a big issue let me illustrate
this with an example here again we have
our remove HTML markup function and here
now comes an input as one could find it
in say a user's document we can run the
whole thing with this input and very
easily reproduce the failure in this
case the failing assertion</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
