open and i I've actually gone into the
repo where the web page resides and I
hear what I'm going to do is I'm going
to host my page on the locals so on the
command for that is Python um M simple
HTTP server atat atat is the port that I
specified on so now I get a message that
it's serving HTTP on a 0 point 0 point 0
port 8080 so when I go to local host on
my web browser I can see that um I can
see the web page to show up um but for
patriot insights you cannot test your
web pages locally because this is
offline and so what I need to do is get
this page up online and that's the
reason why we use in rock and another
way to do it instead of downloading the
entire folder and working with n rock is
hosting your vision github not yo and
then the way to do it is you just want
to go to github and create a new repo
with your username and github io or the
username is your username on github and
that could create that repo and then you
can actually go your username gonna have
that I own and then have your projects
that's right / branches yeah and so
github pages um is just creating another
branch that has all the content in your
master branch pushing it all into a new
branch and hosting an online using the
github dot I old extension um which
automatically makes it into a web page
that's what github I oh does um so yeah
if you don't want to do that and rock it
that way to go yeah if you don't want to
use github or if you're not too
comfortable using github definitely use
on and rock um so now I'm going to open
and
third tab on my terminal and what I'm
going to do is I'm going to call and
rock from where it resides so for me I
have my end rot downloaded in my
downloads folder ok so I'm going to go
there and my downloads folder and just
do da / and bra and I specify the port
on which means I'm taking in whatever is
there in port 8080 and pushing it online
on enjoy back side edge now there's a
tunnel between that and rock is making
between the public internet and this
specific port was right yeah yeah so
when I get that um I get the tunnels
days stages as online and then I have a
version and then forwarding forwarding
actually denotes the website where we
have published online the back page
provided to us um so there are 24
wordings one uses a normal HTTP protocol
and the other one uses a https secure um
so what I'm going to do is I'm going to
take this website i'm going to go to my
browser and open it um here so as here
you can see you can see the same web
page comes up oh it's on the knowledge
ginger yeah now it's on the public
internet and you can analyze it on page
speed insights so when you go to UM when
you actually google for Paige feet
inside the first thing that comes up is
the google developers or web page that
has paid speed insights so what I'm
going to do is here i'm going to enter
the URL on the end broth URL and then
hit analyze so this analyzes the website
no not a very pretty score by ok on so
on the mobile i can see i have a speed
of seventy three out of hundred I'm not
the greatest like adventage using the
PageSpeed insights is that I can see
what I should fix and it gives
suggestions on what can be improved in
your page um so I can see that it says
eliminate render blocking java
and CSS in the above fold content and it
actually gives me a small solution on
how I can do well by loading JavaScript
files are synchronously um which has
been um taught in the class so using the
ascent attribute in your script tags is
going to help you um fix this part is
Oliver yeah yeah and then when I go down
I see that the user experiences hundred
over a hundred which is great um which
means that yeah I've been doing a lot of
things right okay and do you want to go
and see what the desk bound oh so yeah
the desktops not too bad um which feet
it's around 89 out of 100 I think it
gives an overall score unlike the moon
while wire its user experience and speed
making user experience matters a lot
more on smaller devices because okay um
so here you have all suggestions to fix
it so it's going to be pretty
straightforward do actually go about
getting this core to 90 or even above
that um I've got a lot of evaluate
submissions from students who have paid
speed scores are over 90 yeah like it
always happens they have like over 90 of
the egg seen specifications in that
section awesome so once you make that
fix your then with the first part of
your project which is the critical
rendering path and if you were checking
back unit it how good of a job you did
by making sure that you go and paste or
web address in Bates butte insights
again the requirement is only an extra
