about is how long does it take for naive
a B to execute as we look at larger and
larger inputs so these should be really
fast this should still be pretty fast as
we give it larger and larger powers of
two you should notice that it's going to
take longer and longer for this
multiplication to actually execute now I
could keep doing this all day which
probably wouldn't be fun for any of us
what I'll do instead is have the
computer actually do some of these
calculations for me and I'll measure the
time and then we'll plot it and see how
it turns out here's our naive algorithm
again and there's a whole lot of Python
code wrapped around it it's going to
help us do some plotting what we're
gonna do is we're gonna run naive n n
with different values of N and the ends
are gonna be all the powers of two from
two to the zero to two to the 23 and for
each of those what we're gonna do and
the details of this aren't important
we're going to time how long it takes do
that gather all those times together
and then plot them here we go if we run
this it generated a plot and this is
what that plot looks like it's a little
bit crusty to read at the bottom but you
can get a sense of the general shape of
it across this axis is the number that
we're squaring we're sending naive of
this number and it goes up to billions
and this is the time in seconds that it
takes for it to execute and you can see
that it actually follows a very
recognizable pattern so our plot looks
something like this how does the running
time T relate to the input that we're
giving naive n is the running time
roughly constant that as n gets bigger
the time stays about the same is it
roughly logarithmic as n gets bigger the
time grows like the log of n is it
roughly linear as n gets bigger the time
grows like c2 times n for some constant
C or is it roughly exponential where the
time grows like C to the N for some
value of C</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
