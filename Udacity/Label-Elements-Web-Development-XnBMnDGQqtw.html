have our radio buttons and how is the
user to know which is which there's just
three anonymous radio buttons well that
is what the label element is for and
I'll show you how to use that in our
editor so to make this to give the user
a sense of what they're clicking on
rather than just clicking on you know
random dots we're going to use the label
element and it looks something like this
I'll add the label element to each of
these inputs so I've added one label
element the input element stayed the
same for this first one I wrapped it in
a label element that also has the text 1
in it this will cause the word 1 to
appear next to the radio button I'll go
ahead and add it on these other two as
well
okay so I've surrounded our other two
inputs with the label element I you know
added some line breaks in here so it's a
little bit easier to read but all that's
really changed as I've added you know
opening label closing label and then
some text to each one of these let's see
how this looks in the browser when I
load this in the browser now we can see
the labels before our radio buttons and
so when I select one of them one two
three that makes it easier so the user
can see what they're actually doing you
know you give the radio buttons a label
and when I click Submit as we expected q
equals three in the URL now of course
the label doesn't have to match the
value of the radio button but generally
they're closely related</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
