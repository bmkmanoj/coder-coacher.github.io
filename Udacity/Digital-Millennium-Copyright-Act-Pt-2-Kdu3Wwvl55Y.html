exclusions so there are exclusions for
research and educational purposes so if
you're doing research in sort of
understanding how strong secure some
anti-piracy techniques are hopefully now
you're not doing anything illegal
similarly as I said libraries can make
some number of copies and limited number
of copies and that's not viewed as
illegal either so that's one of the
exclusions however I should say that you
know one of the criticism people have
for this laws is that they're kind of
vague and broad and people sort of have
different interpretations of those
depending on who they are so although we
sort of say there are exclusions of
course how far those exclusions go there
have been disagreements about that so
our iia RI AAA which is the recording
industry association of america they
have actually filed lawsuits against
peer-to-peer sharing of music so you
know these are on one side the
electronic frontier foundation or eff
eff sort of what is about a two broader
scope of these laws and potential abuse
of the laws themselves</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
