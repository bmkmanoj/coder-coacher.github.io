loop and the way we do a nested loop is
the way we did the first loop by calling
extend prefix what is the word so far
that we built up well it's the W we had
before and now we're looping through the
letters so we want to add the letter L
to the end of that and now what are the
remaining letters we have in order to
add into that word well that's the
letters we have before with L removed
that's all there is to it and now if we
test words again the speed is almost the
same point 0 0 3 something but the
functions more concise more readable and
more general and that it will take any
number of letters now there's a lot of
variations on this if you type import
this into a Python interpreter you get
out a little set of aphorisms almost
like a poem called the Zen of python by
10 peters and one of them says flat is
better than nested so we can take out
this nested function instead of having
it in here we can make it flat like that
and I've also made a small change here
in that removed works when the when
you're removing any number of letters
here if I only want to remove one letter
I can just call the built-in function
the built-in method letters that replace
directly and when we call test words on
this just to make sure we haven't broken
anything it verifies ok and the speed is
about the same and you can keep it like
this this is a good approach I'm pretty
happy with this one but notice what
we're doing here find words is sort of a
rapper to extend prefix which takes
letters and adds in two more extra
arguments the prefix that we found so
far and the results that that we want to
accumulate the results in two instead of
having one function call a second we
could do this all in one function if we
made these two extra things be optional
arguments so we could do it like that
where we had to have one function fine
words which takes letters and then the
optional prefix so far and results to
accumulate into so now in terms of
pacing let's stop here let's
congratulate ourselves and say we've
done our job we've come up with fine
words and we've said for any set of
letters I can find all the words in the
dictionary that correspond to that hand
of letters and furthermore I can do that
at a speed of two thousand hands per
second which seems pretty good so we've
achieved our first milestone now we
should think first I guess we should
relax
congratulate ourselves have a drink or
whatever it is you need to do and then
when you're ready to come back then we
can start the next leg of the journey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
