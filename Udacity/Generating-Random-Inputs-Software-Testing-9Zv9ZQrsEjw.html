little bit more detail on some of the
different ways that we have to generate
random inputs to our soft rendered test
so start off with our diagram showing
the random test case generator if you
recall from the diagram a little bit
earlier in this unit this test case
generator has two inputs it takes
pseudo-random numbers from a
pseudo-random number generator whence
also predicated on some amount of
knowledge of the domain and that's
supplied by a human now we already
looked at one example testing the outer
where essentially no domain knowledge
was needed that is to say the random
test case generator pretty much took its
pseudo-random numbers and use them
directly as test cases we looked at a
different example that is to say the
credit card number generator where
pseudo-random numbers part of the input
and they weren't directly parroted to
the output but rather they parameterised
an algorithm which created valid credit
card numbers and of course it's possible
to carry that kind of logic farther and
as in as in the example of where we're
testing a file system and we need to
generate valid sequences of API calls
we're testing a web browser where we
need to generate where we need to
actually generate well-formed HTML in
order to test certain parts of the
browser but it turns out all of these
ways of generating input are variations
on a single theme which we call
generative random testing and generative
random testing simply means that inputs
are created from scratch there's an
entirely different approach called
mutation based random testing inputs are
created by randomly modifying existing
non randomly created inputs to the
software under test and so what that
does is change as a diagram a little bit
so that we have a separate source of
input which is the existing test case
one thing we might ask ourselves as well
which approach is better as far as I
know there's no cut and dried answer to
that sometimes generative works really
well sometimes mutation based testing
works really well and it really just
depends on the situation and how much
time you have to spend in general my
view is that generative testing might be
a little bit better at ferreting out
really weird errors but it's a lot more
work to create entire random tests at
least if there's if there are
sophisticated constraints on their form
from scratch mutation testing on the
other hand has a different strength so
let's take a look at that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
