all time are related to the f-16 fighter
plane turns out that when the f16 was
conceived it had a very interesting
feature whenever it would fly and fly
and cross the equator the plane would
instantly flip on its back side and keep
on flying this fortunately only happened
in simulation but imagine what would
have happened in real life well the f16
can actually fly on its back for hours
and hours it turns out that this was a
signage bug in the navigation system
picture what would have happened if this
navigation system had been used for
commercial airlines if you see the
fasten seatbelt sign yes be sure to keep
your seatbelt on at all times another
nice bug story is related to Google's
Android operating system for mobile film
one of the first versions of Android had
a diagnostic mode turned on where an
engineer would be able to use the serial
port to enter arbitrary Unix commands
now interestingly enough if the phone
would not detect a device on the C
report it would fall back to the
built-in keyboard instead what this
meant was that anything you entered on
the keyboard was also interpreted as a
UNIX command this was discovered when
somebody got an SMS asking him what did
you do all day and he answered reboot
and lo and behold with this command the
phone rebooted picture this anything you
say is interpreted as a UNIX command he
could also have said remove files or
drop database or whatever this was very
very quickly fixed
here's another really mysterious bug had
a program and the program crashed so far
so good so inserted a print statement in
order to figure out what was going on to
my big amazement after I inserted the
print statement the bug was gone
classical Heisenberg what was even
better I removed the print statement
again and the bug still was gone now
that's an interesting way to fix bug
what was going on there it turned out
this was a problem in the linker the
linker had two modes it had an
incremental mode in which you would
simply link in changes and it had a non
incremental mode where it would start
linking from scratch and if I made a
small change to the program it would go
into the incremental mode in the
incremental mode the bug was not
triggered so this is why in the first
attempt in the non incremental mode the
bud came to be and later in the
incremental mode the bug was turned off
again but this was hard to work around
essentially what I did was I made a
comment in the build script that would
trigger the incremental mode by simply
linking twice and this is how we worked
around the bug</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
