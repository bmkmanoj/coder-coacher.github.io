help us solve this problem we should
solve this problem going from left to
right following the hierarchy of the
order of operations parentheses and
brackets serve as containers and they
should be evaluated before we do any
operations on to them brackets are
typically used when we have parentheses
inside of them but we still evaluate
them the same way we start at the very
inside and then work our way out I'm
going to simplify this negative of 5
squared I know this 5 squared only goes
with a power so I have 25 or negative 25
now I simplify this parentheses and then
I add negative 20 23 I lose my brackets
because I no longer have parentheses I
just have negative 17 so I write that in
parentheses I can't simplify this
parentheses anymore so now I should go
back and do my order of operations let's
look for powers I have powers here and
here so I should simplify these numbers
I want to be very careful I have the
negative of 3 squared and the negative
of 2 squared are you only square root of
three and I only square the two so i
have negative 9 negative 17 and negative
for adding the opposite is the same
thing as subtraction that's why i can
write negative 17 finally i can add all
these negative numbers up and i'll get
my final answer and i get negative 30
you can think of doing parentheses and
brackets first we don't include them in
our order of operations because well
they're not actually operations they're
just containers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
