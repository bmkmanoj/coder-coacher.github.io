is something like envy VP is we can go
in and we can analyze the program so
this is going to run the program many
times it's collecting a bunch of
statistics about the program it's
averaging them together and now that
we've done this analysis we have a lot
more information about these kernels so
if I click on this you see I have more
statistics over here and the one I want
to highlight for you is the global load
efficiency which tells us how efficient
our global loads were in other words of
all of the bytes that we fetched with
each memory transaction how many of them
were actually useful one hundred percent
looks pretty good that's what we would
expect from fully coalesced accesses the
global store efficiency so now all our
stores to global memory which in our
case is writing the output matrix
achieved 12.5% and that's pretty
wretched right and that's again what we
would expect from having inspected the
code our total DRAM utilization is down
at 7.6 percent again remember this is
not going to exactly match what we
calculated outside the profiler but we
can tell that there's a problem that was
the parallel per row kernel that only
had a single thread block we can see
that the parallel element kernel doesn't
do much better it has slightly higher
global store efficiency very slightly
higher D Ram utilization so we've still
got this problem our our problem is
clearly our ability to write to the
output matrix is hampered we're not
achieving the bandwidth that we ought to
as I said before I'm not intending to go
through all of the many many things that
you can analyze in env VP I'll pull it
up once or twice again and of course
this lecture to just illustrate that
there are tools to help you figure out
what's going wrong you can see in fact
that that down here it's actually
analyzing the program for you and giving
you some suggestions you know saying
look the multi processors in your
program are mostly idle you're not
getting a lot of work done for the total
amount of time that this program runs
and your total compute to emmmm copy
efficiency is low in other words you're
not doing a lot of computation given the
amount of time that you spend doing them
copies here's the mem copies in our
timeline
you can see that we spent you know two
points let's see two point six
milliseconds copying information in and
then you know eight milliseconds
processing it and then another two point
six milliseconds copying it out so it
warns us hey the total compute two min
copy efficiency is low so these are
really useful tools you should use them
you should know about them but we're not
going to rely on them too much in this
class because our point is to teach you
how to reason about things from from
first principles so our problem is bad
coalescing on the right to the output
matrix what can we do about that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
