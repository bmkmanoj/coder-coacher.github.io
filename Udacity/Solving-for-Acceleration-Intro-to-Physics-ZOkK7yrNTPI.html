given to answer this question let's talk
about them first you might have used
this equation this definition of
acceleration to say okay well the ball
changes its velocity by 20 meters per
second by going from 0 to 20 which means
Delta V is equal to 20 meters per second
and since it takes two seconds to drop
delta T is equal to two seconds well
this is just the equation for
acceleration and so our answer is 20 / 2
or 10 meters per second squared so
that's your first answer you may have
given maybe 10 meters per second squared
that's probably the most correct but
your second answer which I would have
been very impressed with as well is how
did Galileo measure speed this was
hundreds of years ago they had no good
way of measuring speed and so the very
question that I gave to you was pretty
flawed in that sense the third answer
you may have given is how did he
measured time get Leo didn't have any
stop watches or fancy chronometer Xin
his day let's see what Professor settle
has to say to realize good results from
the inclined plane needed to be able to
to time precise intervals segments of
motion down the incline plane he didn't
have chronometer 'he's he used a pot of
water with a hole in the bottom which he
could fill to a certain level and which
he could allow water to flow through
which he could open and stop collecting
the water in a container and then
weighing the water</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
