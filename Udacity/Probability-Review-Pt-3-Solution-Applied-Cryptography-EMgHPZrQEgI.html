formula for conditional probability in
this case what a is is the probability
of the coin toss is valid a is valid and
we know that the probability of a is
equal to zero point nine nine nine nine
eight what B is is the probability that
it's heads and so the probability of B
is the probability of H which is zero
point four nine nine nine nine and now
we just have to plug these into the
formula but what we need to use the
formula is the probability of a
intersect B and what a is the
probability of a intersect B well what a
is is valid the set of heads and tails
what B is as heads so if we intersect
heads and tails with heads well we get
tails and we know the probability of
tails is 0.49 i99 so that means using
the formula we have the probability of
tails which is 0.4 99 9 which is the
probability of a intersect B and we're
dividing that by the probability of a
which is valid event which is 0.9 NN + 8
and we get 0.5 and I should note that
this is not the case for real coin
tosses there's no physical coin every
manufacturer that has exactly equal
chances of landing on both sides and in
fact with real coin tosses at least with
American currency there's a much higher
percentage much higher meaning close to
51% rather than 50 that the coin lands
on the same side that it started off
when we talk about mathematical coin
tosses we're going to assume that
there's no edge case and that it's
equally likely that we have a uniform
distribution and there are only two
outcomes when we talk about mathematical
coin tosses we're going to assume that
we have a uniform distribution and there
are only two outcomes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
