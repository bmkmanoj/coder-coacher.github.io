that we have used pages of four
kilobytes and in the most recent quiz we
have used larger pages so how do we
choose the page size that we're going to
support in our processor so comparing
smaller pages to larger pages larger
pages are good because they will result
in a smaller page table the page table
needs to have one entry for each page
that we are using in the case of
multi-level pages so if pages are larger
we will have fewer entries in our page
table smaller pages will suffer from
large page tables so it seems like
larger pages are good but we can only
give memory to applications in units of
pages so if you have a very large page
we will suffer from what is called
internal fragmentation internal
fragmentation occurs when the
application requests some amount of
space let's say this much but we can
only give it space in terms of pages so
we end up giving it for example two
pages where this space in this page is
not really used by the application that
means that whenever this page is
actually in memory it is going to be
using actual physical memory although in
fact only this much of it is being used
by the application so this much physical
memory is going to be wasted whenever
this page is in memory when the page is
on desk this is also wasted because we
store the whole page on the disk but
this is maybe less of a problem because
the disk is usually much larger than the
physical memory so how do we choose the
page size well obviously we want smaller
page tables but we don't want to suffer
from too much internal fragmentation so
just like with the block sizing caches
we want to reach a compromise and it
turns out that the good compromises are
at page sizes from a few kilobytes to a
few megabytes
that is why x86 processors use the four
kilobyte page at the time when they were
designed the bias was slightly more -
all the smaller pages because we were so
worried about wasting memory nowadays
waste of memory even with a megabyte
size page
is relatively small compared to the
overall memory size so if we were
designing a processor nowadays probably
the page size will be closer to a
megabyte than to a four kilobyte page</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
