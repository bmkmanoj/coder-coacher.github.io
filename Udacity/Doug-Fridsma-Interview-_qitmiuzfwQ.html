Doug frizz
m'a doug is a physician and in internal
medicine physician and also has a PhD in
biomedical informatics from Stanford
starting in 2009 he joined the office of
the National Coordinator for health IT
was there for some five years and is now
the president of the american medical
informatics association so Doug thank
you for being here with me today thank
you to let it be on so you were there
from the beginning of high-tech
effectively through the end although ONC
is still in operation from my point of
view you guys accomplished a great deal
more more maybe than then I would have
imagined that many people would have
imagined so can you tell us what you
feel the high points and the major
accomplishments were well i think you
know if you take a look at the adoption
of electronic health records in a
country when we started in 2009 there
was about a 17-percent adoption of
electronic health records just last year
it's at least in them larger medical
centers it's it's close to eighty ninety
percent and even among the physicians in
the smaller practices it's probably in
the range of sixty to seventy percent so
in the course of five years we took
twenty percent of the largest GDP in the
world and we convert it essentially from
a paper-based system to an electronic
system and I think it's not the end that
actually is now the beginning is we
begin to figure out how to connect the
pieces and how we can refine and make
them better for the doctors and the
patients they use them so as I speak
about things today I say that the first
big challenge was adoption and that has
been largely overcome not not entirely
overcome and predictably the next big
challenges interoperability and as you
read about physician frustrations with
EMRs the difficulty of getting these
systems to talk to each other is usually
high on their list if not at the top of
their list so where do you feel we are
on that and what is your crystal ball
tell us well I think interoperability is
probably the next big challenge I think
there are issues in usability I think
there are issues with safety and
security all
things I think are going to be important
now that we've got adoption but one
comes the interoperability the thing
that is so critical is to really define
what it is that you want to do so when
somebody complains that their systems
are not interoperable my first question
to them is well what were you trying to
accomplish the definition of
interoperability is about the ability to
exchange information and then the
ability to use the information that's
been exchanged so you can't separate
interoperability from the thing you want
to do so you know we think sometimes
that interoperability is this green
pasture that we're eventually going to
get to this sort of state of being that
everything is going to work but in fact
interoperability is one of those things
that's based on the things you want to
do it's incremental it's iterative and
we will never probably ever get there
entirely because there will always be a
new thing that we want to do for which
the capability it doesn't exist so in
this course and in the informatics world
in general there's a lot of excitement
about fire as may be the solution to
interoperability what are your views on
that and and you see fire as the sort of
tool that can evolve as people's
requirements become more sophisticated
over time so the great thing about fire
is it solves a problem and when you've
got a standard or if you've got a
technology that solves a problem people
are going to use it because it helps
them you know a lot of times we create
standards in committees and we have the
expectation that if we build it people
will then use it and we've got that
wrong what we need to do is we need to
find the problems for which we can
develop standards that solve those
solutions hl7 which is sort of the place
that fire has has developed it had their
first set of standards really to help
create interoperability within the
enterprise and many of the vendors
adopted it it was wildly successful it
was able to connect all of the pharmacy
systems to the laboratory systems and
things using the those kinds of messages
fire stands to transform the same thing
between enterprises and because it's
aimed at the implementer
and geared towards the person who's
actually going to have to use it it's
simple it's easy to use it uses the best
technologies that are out there and a
standard isn't a standard because you
say it is it's a standard because people
use it and this is a standard that
people actually are using and so I think
it's going to have tremendous impact so
shifting gears a bit we've we've
emphasized in this course or an hour
emphasizing the chronic disease patient
who's got multiple problems and multiple
doctors there's an obvious need for
information sharing their and the role
that the patient might and arguably
should play in their own care as you
look out to the future how do you see
the patient fitting into the whole
spectrum of informatics and and the
where the data is stored and how the
data is accessed well you know you can
take a look at what's happened in other
parts of a person's life an individual's
life to get a sense for what may be
happening in healthcare so it used to be
that to get an airline ticket you had to
call up a travel agent who would then I
access the system that you had no way of
knowing what was in there now all of
those things are available for
individuals and they can make their own
hotel reservations and their own plane
tickets I think eh ours right now we're
kind of in that same same role you know
you go there there's information in
there that the doctor tells you about
and then you use that information in
your health care as we begin to open
that up not only in terms of having
access for patients but for patients to
put their own information into it you
suddenly have one more information and
you empower the patient to have a whole
lot more knowledge about what's going on
so to me it's not a matter of if it's a
matter of when because the things that
are happening in the rest of society are
going to begin to impact health care in
a substantive way and as it becomes
easier and cheaper for patients to have
access to their own information that's
going to happen so if if adoption was
the first big challenge and
interoperability as a second at least in
my view of the world the third is
analytics where do you think we are at
analytics and where do you think we're
going to go in the next few years
I think again there's a lot of good work
that's been done in bioinformatics I
think we're starting to see it in other
areas in which people are beginning to
aggregate that data part of the
challenge that we have in healthcare is
that not only do we have knowledge about
healthcare and medicine and the
association's there we need to be able
to apply that to the data that we see
and so it isn't simple mathematical
relationships it isn't necessarily
simple associations but there's sort of
a deep understanding of medicine and
care delivery that's embedded in the
data there so it's an exciting time
because as more and more of this data
becomes available we're going to be able
to apply those informatics techniques to
be able to extract information but to do
it in a way that is understanding of how
the care is delivered and if we can
leverage the best that's happening in
the engineering field and computer
science and marry that with what we
understand about healthcare delivery I
think we're going to make some good
progress are we there yet no I think
there's still a lot that needs to be
done we're seeing some areas of
excellence sort of centers that are
doing some of that there are some
hospitals like guys and girl and Kaiser
and others that are doing some some
analytic work but I only see this
accelerating at an incredibly rapid pace
storage and the movement of the data is
becoming less and less expensive and as
a result I think more and more analytics
will be applied is the lack of structure
in a great deal of medical record
information a barrier to that is do we
need to keep pushing toward a goal that
many of us have years and years ago of
everything being structured or are we
okay with where we're at terms of the
nature of the data I actually think that
you need structure when you need to make
decisions or help for an individual
patient or a small group of patients
it's difficult to determine a drug drug
interaction through our data analytics
on a single patient so you need to be
able to categorize that stuff so that
rules can fire and alerts can be sent
but when you start to have
of millions of patients I think the need
for structure actually goes down and
even technologies like IBM Watson
unstructured structured data to be able
to do the analytics that they do so I
think we need to be very comfortable
with the ability to have unstructured
data part of the challenge that we're
going to have is that if what we do is
we require structure as a barrier to
exchange of information we're going to
sell ourselves short in our ability to
do analytics we need to get all the data
out there so that we can apply those
analytics if you could rewind the clock
and spend your five years at ONC all
over again what are one or two things
you would do differently you know it was
a remarkable time to be in the federal
government with the passage of the
high-tech and just the excitement that
was going on you know obviously if all
of the standards had been baked and had
been ready that we could have just
picked them off the shelf and put them
out there you know that would have made
our job a lot easier you know what we
need is going to be a portfolio we have
the beginnings of a portfolio I think we
did a grand experiment that was
different than any other country in
terms of how we tried to approach this
problem we didn't engineer it from the
top down we created the building blocks
and allowed the market to sort of drive
that now it's resulted in some
innovative companies sort of getting
lost I wish there was a way that we
could have created a a playing field
that allowed everybody to sort of
equally compete but sometimes that's
hard and when you use a market driven
approach there are some winners and
losers in all of that the challenge that
we have I think is that as we have all
of these products out there we've
reached a level of saturation and
adoption in the marketplace we're going
to start to see some consolidation
what's important is that we don't lose
that innovative and entrepreneurial edge
as that happens and I think things like
fire that produce the ability to create
apps and to create other kinds of
functionality are going to be really
important as we go into that next level
where we take what we have now when we
begin to refine it and add the
linux that we need the Jason report
essentially paints a picture of ehrs as
a database and most of the end user work
particularly physicians and patients is
done through apps that access data from
that database using fire and also of
course can add data to it is that the
world of the future of the to see I
think increasingly the electronic health
record is going to be a data store in
the sky I think that patients are going
to be the principal health information
exchange and that they'll be the hub for
all this information that's going to be
exchanged I hope that at the end all of
this technology doesn't create
additional barriers for patients but
makes them first order participants in
their care I think when that happens we
are actually going to be able to have
tremendous innovation perhaps the
biggest underutilized innovative force
in medicine is the patient and I think
their needs are going to probably drive
more innovation than anything that we
could think of I think about with regard
to physicians and nurses and and and
others who are using the electronic
health record so the the exercise the
students in this course are going
through in teams to to learn fire and
develop fire apps toward the future
world where that's the primary vehicle
for use by physicians and patients makes
sense to you it sounds like yeah it does
I think that's a great approach to kind
of set the stage I mean if you want to
know what the future is you have to be
there and try to inventor well great
thank you so much thank you for being
