check the statements that are true
regularization will likely have the most
impact when the load is relatively
evenly distributed among tasks but with
some significant outliers so for example
most US counties contain at most one
city but there are a few that have you
know dozens of cities or is it the case
that regularization will have the most
impact when the load varies wildly from
task to task and by wildly I really mean
that there's no there's no real average
case an example of this would be
popularity some people have claimed that
celebrity popularity like if you measure
something like the number of followers
somebody has on Twitter follows a power
law graph distribution and power law
looks something like this and if true
then this would mean that at any level
of popularity a roughly fixed fraction
of people will be twice as popular okay
so this case you might say that Oh
eighty percent of the people
twenty percent of the people are have
twice as many followers as the remaining
80% of the people below the line and
that that becomes true no matter where
you draw the line so that would be a
power law and a case like this there's
no real average case a few very popular
people have as many Palo errs as the
rest of the world combined there's an
interesting discussion of this that I
found online I'll put it in the
instructor notes
finally is it true to say that
regularization will likely have the most
impact when the application can predict
load imbalance at runtime in other words
can predict where and how load imbalance
will occur so an example here is that it
might be a lot easier to add up the
number of cities in a grid cell and
notice that there's going to be load
imbalance than to actually perform some
heavyweight computation on each city</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
