vehicle to teach about the design of
computer programs if you don't know the
rules of poker yet don't worry that's
exactly what this video is for now if
all you know about poker is what you've
seen on TV or in a casino you may think
it's pretty complicated there's that
intimidating green table and it's
surrounded by some very serious-looking
people and these people often have very
silly hats or ridiculous sunglasses and
they're saying things like rays or all
in now if you ever want to actually play
poker you're gonna have to learn what
all this means
there's betting there's folding there's
calling there's raising and it can get
pretty complicated there's a lot of
strategy involved but for the purposes
of this unit we only need to know the
most basic aspect of poker and this
aspect is common to every single
variation of poker and that's how hands
are ranked because at the end of the day
all of these different versions of Poker
have to do with making the best
five-card hand that you can now these
different hands each have different
names and there are nine of them so
let's talk about what each of these
names mean and since this class uses
Python I'll start my numbering at 0 the
best hand and this is one that you
almost never see in poker is the
straight flush and here we have a
straight flush the suit here is hearts
you can see every single card is a heart
and they're all in sequential order 9 10
Jack Queen King if you ever go into a
poker forum online you would see these
cards written as 9 h t HJ h qh k h and
that's the system we're going to use
here the next best hand is four of a
kind and here we have a four of a kind
with four aces and a six the six is
usually irrelevant to this hand but
we'll talk a little bit about how to
break ties in class next best is the
full house and a full house is just
three cards of one rank so here we have
three tens and two of another so two
twos this hand is a full house that we
would call tens full of two's next is
the flush and a flush is five cards of
the same suit and here the ranks don't
matter you can see we have a three six
Jack queen and king but they're all of
the suit Spade next we have the street
and a straight is just five cards in
sequential order five six seven eight
nine and here the suit doesn't matter at
all we have a spade Diamond Club diamond
and another Spade our next hand is the
three of a kind and three of a kind is
just three cards of the same rank so
here these three fours are what's
relevant the Queen in the again in some
special circumstances where we're
playing with multiple decks they may be
used to break a tie and again we'll talk
about that in class next we have two
pair for example a pair of jacks and a
pair of nines would be to pair the
second-worst hand is a pair and a pair
is just two cards of the same rank here
we have two threes the eight five two
don't do much to help our hand here
finally we have nothing so we could also
call that high card because when two
people who have nothing show down their
hands the one with the highest card wins
here we have King high and this is
really quite a bad hand if you're ever
in a casino I wouldn't go playing this
and expecting to win and that's it those
are our nine hands straight flush four
of a kind Full House flush straight
three of a kind two pair pair and
nothing notice that we've assigned them
all number zero through eight this is
one of the numbers we'll be using in our
poker program to compare hands it turns
out we'll need a few other numbers to
distinguish between for example two full
houses six verse six is an adequate
we'll need to add some other numbers in
there but we'll explain that in class
and for now you should understand the
rules of Poker well enough to follow
along</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
