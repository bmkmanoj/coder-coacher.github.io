is to just use the free Wi-Fi at cafes
and similar public places you are
trusting the store order to not do
anything dodgy and you're trusting that
every other person currently using the
Wi-Fi hotspot is a good person but only
can they listen to your traffic you are
broadcasting it over radio waves after
all but they could also tamper with the
data you receive this is a harmless
change but what if you wanted to check
your bank account on a public Wi-Fi
think about every other person being
able to read or change your data we
definitely don't want that HTTPS is a
way to prick you and your users from
malicious cafe owners and visitors as a
web developer HTTPS is even more
important since all modern browsers
api's are only available if your website
is secured with a GPS to exploit the
full potential of the web you need to
start using HTTPS and not just for the
login page but every single page knowing
a web page is using HTTPS will give your
users peace of mind in these kind of
public places how can you tell other
words it is using HBS and how can you
tell the website is using H to be as
correctly and how can you use HBS on
your own website that's what this lesson
is about</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
