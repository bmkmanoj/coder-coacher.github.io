would do feature transformation and I
think the answer is obvious even to the
most casual observer we actually just
went through a couple of examples in the
previous slide like X or the kernel
methods all of these things we've done
before where effectively we were doing
feature transformation in fact you could
argue that things like neural networks
are already doing feature transformation
so we've been doing feature
transformation all along and so the real
question here is is there some specific
reason why we should do this feature
transformation explicitly and separate
from some specific learning algorithm
that is doing its own feature
transformation such as a perceptron or a
neural network or support vector
machines so I'm just gonna very quickly
go through a simple example that I hope
illustrates why you might want to do
this but it's still kind of a large
relevant example okay you with me I'm
ready okay so here's the problem I'm
going to describe and I'm not going to
do it in a lot of detail I really just
want to give you an intuition that
problem is information retrieval so in
particular I'm talking about what's
called ad hoc retrieval you know the ad
hoc retrieval problem is I assume that
if you start with a key and you add hock
to it you get hockey no that would be a
kind of feature transformation we would
call that the pun transformation the ad
hoc retrieval problem maybe I can help
you out by calling it by another
nickname it's the Google problem which
is you have a whole bunch of documents
and some database somewhere this is me
drawing a database and you want to
retrieve exactly the subset of documents
that are relevant to some query so this
is me drawing documents so I might type
in a word like machine learning into
some text box somewhere click on some
button and then get back a list of
relevant documents nicely sorted against
the white background and this is the ad
hoc query problem that hoc retrieval
problem I give you some features which
in this case are words and you return
objects in this case documents that are
somehow relative to the relevance to
those features okay so we do this all
the time what makes it ad hoc as opposed
to
what there's various other kinds of
information retrieval problems this
one's just called the ad hoc one
what's that talked about it just you
don't already know what the queries are
you aren't doing something like
clustering the documents it's just that
you're gonna be given some unknown query
which is in some feature space and
you're just gonna have to retrieve the
things that are relevant so it's just
always been called the ad hoc problem as
far as I know I guess because you don't
know what these are going to be before
him yeah and like as opposed to maybe
some kind of standing query like I want
any information that talks about the OMS
program you know please alert me right
exactly and that's a actually got a name
too
it's not the standing query problem but
it's a kind of triage problem can't
remember what it's called right now but
yeah so there's different versions of
this this one is in some ways the
hardest because you can't do a lot of
very clever things up front in order to
figure out the best way to store your
documents because you don't know what
this ad hoc query is going to be okay
yep all right so why is this problem
hard other than by saying I don't know
what this is going to be so let's think
about it in terms of the features that
you have</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
