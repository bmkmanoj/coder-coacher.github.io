this let's first talk about depth
estimation using this sensor and this
kind of a coated aperture they were able
to compute depth one single image just
using this coated aperture and this is
the output they would get not perfect
but this is what you get out of a single
image and then they actually came up
with an algorithm that would regularize
the depth to be able to generate an
image like this I encourage you to look
at the concept of regularization but
among other things it basically is one
of the best ways of smoothing out the
information and that basically is the
way that this kind of details were kind
of gone right off and allow you to kind
of generate a much better mask for that
so of course if you look at it after
doing regularization you can actually
get a much better sense of depth in this
paper they also kind of suggested so
sometimes by simple manual intervention
you can also improve results another
example of this kind of stuff again we
have regular eyes depth here some of the
stuff is lost but again from a simple
camera you can actually do quite well
with these types of things and here by
just adding a little bit of Corrections
manually you can actually now get the
shapes that you wanted or the depth that
you want it and these are the gestures
that were actually required to help me
do this let's look at a few examples
this is an example of focus Corrections
so of course this is an input and you
can see a lot of focusing you know and
defocusing artifacts here of course it's
not completely all be focused here but
with this method now we know the things
we can actually use this to deconvolve
the thing and now the whole image is
completely in focus another example just
look at this is this was the original
image and if you just zoom in in this
output image and again the coded image
captured all of the details allowing you
to after the fact in a post editing mode
be able to now actually visualize a
focused image another close up is this
example here when given an input image
of two people when we can see is badly
focused and of course now the whole
image has been focused correctly again
the camera captured all the information
and you can do this after the fact and
the example again is the original image
had a lot of focus blur and you can see
a much sharper image as the output of
course we could do some sort of you know
naive sharpening and stuff like that
simple examples like this on this image
and again there are methods out there
but again the point basically being this
was done on the camera itself with a
coated aperture</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
