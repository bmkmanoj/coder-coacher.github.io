doing when they meet up once a week
they're going to be presenting their
lessons learned and they're going to be
presenting in front of their entire
peers now one is you'll be sitting in
the back of the room
both the facilitators and the mentors
and critiquing what they've learned and
as they present remember you've been
reading their launchpad central blog
post so you kind of know who they've
been talking to so this is almost a
summary but you will be giving them
comments in the meantime the students
instead of just sitting there and doing
their email who are not presenting I
actually have a shared Google Doc and
they're doing peer grading of their
peers of their presentations and giving
them feedback as well and what the
students are doing outside the classroom
are 10 to 15 hours of customer discovery
and they're spending at least an hour a
week blogging what they've learned and
they're using the launchpad central tool
to do that and they're watching the
lectures online on the Udacity site what
you're doing is facilitators and coaches
is you're answering questions about the
lectures and you're critiquing team
presentations and what the teaching team
is using is you're using a shared Google
Doc sitting in the back of the room
grading while the students are using
their peer grading doc which is very
separate from yours so they don't get to
see your grades and you get to see their
as a later but now the teaching team is
actually writing down what you think of
each one of the teams and again in
between the week's your job is to review
and comment on the team's customer
discovery narrative using the launchpad
central tool</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
