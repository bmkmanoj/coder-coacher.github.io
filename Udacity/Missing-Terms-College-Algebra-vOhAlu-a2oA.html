practice using long division so let's do
this problem as well this time we're
starting out with X cubed minus 1 and
I'd like us to divide that by X minus 1
how do you write this using long
division though well you might think it
would be this way like before all I've
done is taking the thing we want to
divide written our lovely long division
symbol surrounding it and then write the
thing we want to divide it by outside
this isn't going to work quite right in
this situation of this polynomial though
here's why we only have two terms here
but this is a cubic polynomial with
other cubix we've worked with we've had
a term for every single power starting
with the highest power and descending
this time we don't have an x squared
term and we don't have an X term in
order to do long division properly
though we still need to leave slots for
those terms in the expression that we
start out with instead we're going to
need to write the polynomial like this
note that by writing 0x squared + 0 X
for the x squared and X terms we're not
changing the value of the original
expression we had underneath the
division sign but we are still leaving
room for the terms with these powers now
we're in great shape to do our division
so let's do it please write your final
answer in this box</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
