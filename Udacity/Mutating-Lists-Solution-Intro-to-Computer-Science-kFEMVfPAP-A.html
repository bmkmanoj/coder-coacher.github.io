that if we have some code that does some
stuff and has and we have a list and we
I don't know compute some solution that
if I insert this call to the function
proc one two three or four s will go
through them that this code behaves
exactly the same no matter what else it
does so let's get to it
in this first procedure there's only one
line and we set the first value of P to
equal its second value this is going to
change the elements in P so I mean if we
had in a list that was one two executing
proc one would then change it to two two
so obviously that's that can very well
affect how this code executes so this
isn't right this one can be a little
tricky so let's work through it we know
that P is a pointer to a list so it's
one two and three
now we're reassigning what P points to
two the original value of P which is
this concatenated with the list 1 this
is going to create a new list because
that's what the plus operator does with
lists we want to create a new list now P
points to this we don't do anything with
P but most importantly the original list
has been left unchanged the end result
is that this is good we can go through
this problem like we did the previous
one
we start with a variable P that points
to a list we then create a new variable
Q which points to the same thing as P on
P we append 3 and then on Q which is the
same list we pop 3 the end result is the
same list we had before here we create a
new list called Q which is an empty list
there's nothing there then while P is
not empty we append on the Q what we pop
from P so if we remember the pop is
going to take the last entry in P and
return it it's going to pop off 3 and
then I want to pin that on the Q and
this is going to continue until we have
the reverse of the previous list here
and P is empty which shall just
symbolize with that then we're going to
reverse the process here and if I undo
what I just did the end result we have
the original list and we have an empty
list
this doesn't matter the main point is
that we still have our original list
this one is good</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
