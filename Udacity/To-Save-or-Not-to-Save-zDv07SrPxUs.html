that actually save changes that the user
makes remember that up until this point
we could change the text of our default
note but that whenever the app
relaunched the same text for that note
would appear and any changes added by
the user would be lost we can persist
the users changes to the note by adding
just a few lines let's take another look
at our core data stack struct if we
scroll down to the bottom we can see
that we have this extension here that
already contains what looks to be a save
function save context if context dot has
changes try context save so it looks
like this is a wrapper function for this
context save function so what is this
dot save function it looks like it's a
function of ns-managed object context
and it attempts to commit unsaved
changes to registered objects to the
receivers parents store okay so perfect
it looks like all we need to do is call
this save context function from our
instance of core data stack when we want
to save our changes but I guess the
question is then where and when do we
want to call this several things happen
when the save function is called out of
context all properties and relationships
are validated all new and modified
objects are saved to disk and all
deleted objects are removed from the
database these three steps depending on
how much data we're dealing with could
actually take a human perceivable amount
of time because of this it's really
important to think about and carefully
choose when to call this function if we
call it after every change the user
makes that will become sluggish and
possibly timeout but if we call it to
seldomly we risk the user potentially
losing data so when is the right time to
save let's look through some of the
methods in our app delegate that
represent the different states of the
apps lifecycle and see if maybe one of
those methods is a good place to save
the app state</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
