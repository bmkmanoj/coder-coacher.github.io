class diagram class is represented as a
rectangle with three parts the first
part is the class name classes should be
named using the vocabulary of the domain
so we should pick names that make sense
and the normal naming standard requires
that classes are singular nouns starting
with the capital letter the second part
of a class are the attributes of the
class where the set of attributes for
the class define the state for the class
and we can list an attribute simply by
name or we can provide additional
information for example we might define
the type of the attribute and we may
also define an initial value for the
attribute finally the third part of the
class consists of the operations of the
class and normally the operations of the
class are represented by name with a
list of arguments that the operation
will take as input and with the result
type so the type of the result produced
by the operation something else you
cannot in this representation is the
fact that there is a minus before these
attributes and a plus before this
operation this indicates what is called
the visibility of these class members so
the minus indicates that the attributes
are private to the class so only
instances of this class roughly speaking
can access these attributes and notice
that this is what allows to enforce the
information hiding principle because
clients of the class cannot see what's
inside this box
what are these attributes the plus
conversely indicates that this is a
public operation so something that is
visible outside the class and in fact
normally this is what we use to define
the interface for my class so we
encapsulate the state of the class and
we make it accessible to the extent that
we want and that is needed through a set
of public operations last finger 1 or
not is the use of these ellipses that we
can utilize if we want to indicate that
there are more attributes for example or
more operations but we just don't want
to list them now now that we know what a
class is and how it is represented let's
start our analysis of our course
management system by identifying the
relevant classes in the system we need
to bring back the description of our
system and what we want to do is that we
want to go through the description and
underline the relevant nouns in the
description
and here I encourage you to stop the
video and to do the exercise of
underline such nows yourself before
listening to my explanation and to how I
do it for example in this case I may
want to underline the registration
manager which is a noun and probably a
relevant one the scheduling algorithm
also seems like a relevant concept so is
the course the course offerings again
course offering over here definitely the
students seem to be a relevant noun and
so is probably the registration form and
the professor's okay so at this point I
identified seven possible classes for my
system so what I'm going to do is simply
to create classes for each one of these
nouns so my initial class diagram looks
exactly like this with the seven classes
where for each class I pick the name
that is representative of the domain so
in this case it's pretty straightforward
the registration form is called
registration form the student is called
student and so on and so forth but you
can already see how this analysis method
is starting from a description of the
real world and it's just identifying
objects or classes in the real world and
transforming them into entities in my
analysis document</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
