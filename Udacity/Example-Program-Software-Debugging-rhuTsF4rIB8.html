program that failed and which we need to
debug for this purpose let's build a
simple program that we're going to use
as an ongoing example the idea is to
write a function that takes an HTML
input that is text together with HTML
markup and returns just the text for
instance if the input is HTML markup for
bold followed by a text foo followed by
HTML markup for end of bold then we want
to return just the text anything that is
within these angle brackets should be
stripped away how do we do this a simple
way is to process the HTML input
character by character and distinguish
two modes when we are in tag mode we
ignore all input when we are in non tag
mode we add all input to the output and
we switch between these modes tag and
non tag by looking at these angle
brackets in here when we see the
beginning of an HTML markup as you can
see in this less than sign we enter tag
mode when we see the end of an HTML
markup that is a greater sign we exit
tag mode we can describe the behavior of
our function as a finite state machine
with two states non tech mode that is
the processing text and tag mode that is
we are ignoring HTML markup when we see
a less than sign we go into tag mode
when we see a greater than sign we exit
tag mode for all other inputs we stay in
the same States when we are in non tech
mode and see any character that's not
the beginning of an HTML markup we add
this character to the output whereas in
tag mode we simply ignore the HTML
markup every process in here so when we
are processing this HTML input initially
we're in non-tech mode now we see the
beginning of an HTML markup we go into
tag mode we see the B which is not the
end of a tag then we get the end of the
tag go back into non tag mode see the F
at this see the o at this see the O at
this again so output now is f oo and now
again we see the beginning of a tag
where we process or most specifically
where we ignore all characters up to the
closing tag and then our output is
indeed the text
inside the HTML markup</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
