machines that we've been using that
involve epsilon transitions or ambiguity
remember ambiguity means that I can go
to two different places on the same
input our formerly known as
non-deterministic finite state machines
non-deterministic here just means that
you may not know exactly where to go or
where to put your finger it's not
lockstep you have choices you have
freedom a lockstep finite state machine
with no epsilon transitions and no
ambiguity by contrast is called a
deterministic finite state machine
everything is determined from the start
given the finite state machine in the
input you always know exactly what will
happen our finite state machines
simulation procedure can handle
deterministic finite state machines that
makes them really useful for
implementing regular expressions under
the hood let me just show you an example
of this non determinism just to drive at
home suppose we're back here in this
previous finite state machine but now
the input is 1 - 2 3 where are we now we
started here and on a1 we went here and
then I guess if we're supposed to stay
alive and there's a - we must have gone
here and taken the - and now there's a 2
but now this is really not obvious I
could stay here on this self loop for 3
or I could have gone back on this free
epsilon transition and done the self
loop here on a 3 so I could be in state
2 or state 5 since there isn't one
single answer for where I could be this
is non-deterministic as a bit of a fun
aside in this notion of determinism or
non determinism can be related to the
question of freewill in philosophy can
we actually make independent choices or
is everything preordained by the current
state of the world and forces acting on
it like a lockstep game of billiards or
snooker or pool some philosophers will
approach this by suggesting that we have
the illusion of free will that's a
disconcerting thought which is handy for
describing subjective experience we
certainly often feel like we have free
will
regardless of what's going on in the
real world we're going to see that
something similar holds for finite state
machines although non-deterministic
finite state machines look like they
have much more power
much more freedom anything that could be
done with them could also be done in our
deterministic billiard ball world in
fact you can watch me suck freewill out
of this world right now
every non-deterministic finite state
machine has a corresponding
deterministic finite state machine that
accepts exactly the same strings
non-deterministic finite state machines
are not any more powerful than
deterministic finite state machines
they're just more convenient it's easier
to write them down let's see an example
of this extraordinary claim suppose we
have this regular expression there are
only two strings than language of this
regular expression but here I've drawn
out a very elaborate finite state
machine for it that has epsilon
transitions coming out the wazoo this is
very non-deterministic we definitely
need to see an a but then here these two
epsilon transitions represent the
explicit choice
do I do the B or do I skip over it then
the top road we need to see the be on
the bottom road we skip entirely past it
and then in any event we need to see the
C I'm now going to write a deterministic
finite state machine that does exactly
the same thing and I'm going to hint at
how this conversion works we'll see this
again in just a minute after I see an A
I could be in - or I could take the
epsilon 2 3 I could have taken the
epsilon down here - 6 or all the way
over to 4 so there are 4 places I could
be in that's a lot of fingers I'll just
record all of them as the name for my
new state - 3 6 4 from here if I see a B
and I survive remember a finite state
machines work if there's any path that
gets to the end it must have been that I
was in state 3
at which point now I'm just in state 4
by contrast if I was back here and I saw
a C it must have been that I was in
state 4 and now I'm in state 5 and then
finally if I'm in state 4 and I see a C
I end up here so this deterministic
finite state machine accepts the same
language as the one above the two
strings a b c and AC are both in it but
it does not have epsilon transitions or
ambiguity in any particular node they're
never
two edges going out labeled a and there
are never epsilon transitions let's see
another example of how this works again
I'm going to build a deterministic
machine where every state in the
deterministic machine corresponds to a
set of states in the non-deterministic
one again to restate that you give me a
non-deterministic machine I'm gonna
build you a deterministic machine D that
accepts the same language and the way
I'll do it is every state in D is going
to correspond to a set of states in the
non-deterministic machine you gave me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
