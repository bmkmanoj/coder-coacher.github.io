customers don't exist today that's the
real questions are if they don't exist
how will they find out about you and how
will they even become aware that they
need to be in this new market and by the
way how do you know the market size of
something that doesn't even exist today
the market size is zero and what factors
should you create that the industry is
never offered now a way to look at this
is take a look at the chasm man this is
scary that is you can sell to the crazy
people all you want the early Vangelis
the early adopters and that's nice but
you'll have a small business until you
figure out how do we get the masses to
adopt and here's what that hockey-stick
sales curve looks like
here are the early people you're selling
to and one of the mistakes that startups
and entrepreneurs and founders make is
look at that slope of those early sales
and when you get them you go great time
to like kick up spending and look at
this our boards happy and why don't we
start doing advertising and staffing up
the company but then it kind of declines
and people scratch their head going
what's going on what's going on is the
mainstream market just hasn't adopted
and this might go on for years and never
kick in but if you're lucky you'll hit a
tipping point and market adoption
happens and when it happens it happens
faster than you can imagine but at times
it takes longer to get there than you
can imagine
so in a new market one of the things you
need to be thinking about is that is
there any possible way to move this
curve in there's a couple of really
interesting things to notice about a new
market one is this valley of death of
almost no sales can continue for years
now why is this important to know well
just imagine you're a startup and you've
put together a nice financial forecast
for your board and your investors and
they all believe that you are in an
existing market so they're expecting you
to have revenue that increases every
year
why because you've never asked the
question what type of market am i in now
if you're in a new market you now know
that it's quite possible that you might
have a curve that doesn't look like this
but actually is flat for a long period
of time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
