predict the forty percent of employees
who didn't respond to our survey the
first thing I would do is I would take
or force model that we're going to use
and output the model object so I'm able
to use it in a new workflow so I'm going
to use an output data tool go to file
browse and save this off as model or mod
obj underscore at them for forest model
I can then run this workflow to save off
that model object of the forest model
like I mentioned before this is just
personal preference for me I'm then
going to go to a blank canvas and input
that model object which I'm going to use
in a score tool before I go ahead and
bring in a score tool though let me
bring in another data set which is my
forty percent of employees that didn't
respond to our survey it's titled
missing employees I'm then going to go
to ask or tool bring that in and load in
each of my input data into each side of
the score tool they're going to bring in
a browse tool and run this model what
we're able to see now is for every
employee based off this forest model
what is a predictive probability that
they take either a bike to work they
drive to work or they take a public
transportation bus or train or whatever
it might be to work what we should do
now is turn these predictive
probabilities into ones and zeros so we
can get an actual count so how I'm going
to do that is I'm going to build a
conditional statement saying if bike
score was greater than the car and the
public transportation then it should be
one and those should be zeros and vice
versa all around so we have ones and
zeros rather than just a predictive
probability percentage with that then it
can aggregate my data up to get the
count of how many individuals actually
bike drive or take public transportation
to work so let's go ahead and bring in a
formula tool I'm going to replace
the score bike filled by building out a
conditional statement and this
conditional statement is going to be if
score bike is greater than score car and
score bike is greater than score public
transportation then we're going to say
it's 1 else 0 end if if i run this you
can see now we have square bikes as ones
and zeros yet we still have our
predicted probabilities for the score
cars and score public transportation so
let's go ahead and do the exact same
thing for now the other two fields so if
i run this now what you're able to see
in the browse window is we have all ones
and zeros so now what we want to do is
we want to sum up all the records are
all the values within each the score car
the score public transportation and the
score bike to then get the total count
of individuals who take public
transportation or their bike or drive to
work so let's bring in a summarized tool
to do this where I can simply go over my
score bike square car and score public
transportation fields and add some what
that's going to give me is the sum of
the score of the bike some of the score
of the car some of the score of public
transportation and we could rename those
if we choose to do so what I want to do
is simply just hit run now what we have
here are the results that we were
expecting what we have is the mode of
transportation for each of the forty
percent of employees that did not
respond to that survey so it looks like
913 actually drive to work we have 481
that take public transportation and 141
that bike to work</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
