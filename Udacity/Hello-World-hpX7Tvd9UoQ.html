video was recorded April 6 2015 now my
suggestion to you is that you don't
follow along with the video instead go
ahead and watch the video through once
after you're done with that we've
provided some text instructions in the
instructor notes from time to time
Android studio is updated which means
that menus or screens can look a little
bit different and while the video might
be out of date the text instructions
will be updated a lot more regularly ok
so if you've closed and routes to do go
ahead and reopen Android studio you
should be staring at this screen I'm
going to go ahead and click on this
aptly named start a new Android studio
project button alright that should take
you to this screen where we have a
couple of different options the first
one is the application name this is the
name that you'll see in the app bar at
the top of the app as well as the all
apps screen of the device ok right below
this we have copied a domain and if this
looks similar to our web address you're
right normally if you owned a web
address you'd type it in here
now at one point in my life I owned lyla
fujiwara comm so if I was making an app
for myself instead of a demo app for all
of you I would go ahead and change this
to Lila Fujiwara comm now you might be
wondering why well if I was planning to
distribute my app on Google Play this
package name down here is something that
I need to uniquely identify my app
meaning that across all of the people in
the world who are making apps this needs
to be completely unique now if we look a
little bit more of the structure of this
the package name is actually the company
domain reversed so instead of Lila
Fujiwara com we have combo fujiwara
followed by the application name with no
spaces so while there might be a couple
of different app developers that make a
happy birthday app you're not gonna have
a bunch of app developers that all own
Lila fujiwara comm and they're making a
birthday card app and in the way that
the internet is set up if I buy Lila
Fujiwara calm that means I should have
complete control over what is shown
there and nobody else can buy that
domain name and if I own it and it's
specific to me
then that helps ensure that this package
name is completely unique ok but you're
not me and you don't
own this domain and since we're all
practicing together and I want us all to
have sort of the same setup for this app
I'm gonna change this to Android
example.com and you should go ahead and
use the same company domain name because
I know that some of you won't actually
own website domains yourself also it'll
help you match our code if you look
below you should see com example Android
happy birthday and if you look below you
should see that it says com done
examples that Android again that's the
reverse of Android example comm and that
it says happy birthday after it okay so
the next thing that you can change is
the project location this is where all
the files that have to deal with your
app will be saved on your computer
now usually Android studio will create a
folder for your Android studio projects
and the default is to just put your app
inside this folder you can see that the
name actually matches the name of the
folder that it will be in this is a
pretty good default location so unless
you have any strong reason to change it
I'd go ahead and just click Next
ok now this is a fun screen it lets us
pick what phones and devices that we're
gonna actually make our application for
now you're making an app for a phone in
a tablet and you're not trying to make
an app for TV wear or glass so we're
gonna leave these all unchecked the drop
down right here shows us the version of
the Android operating system that our
application will support I'm gonna go
ahead and scroll up we can see that the
first public and widely used release of
Android was called cupcake with this
release Google started a convention
where they would continue to go
alphabetically but named each operating
system off of desserts or sugary treats
cupcake was followed by donut and Eclair
and this is why you'll see words like
Ice Cream Sandwich honeycomb and KitKat
in the drop-down menu now below this
drop-down you'll see this handy help me
choose link the scrap shows some helpful
percentages of how many people who have
Android phones use the different
operating system versions looking at it
we can see that most user is at least at
the time of this recording are using the
deliciously named KitKat the percentages
should the percentage of people in the
world use at Google Play who will be
able to use ur app if we pick one of
these as our minimum supported version
so if you pick the newest version of the
operating system which is
we pop at least at the time of this
recording only users with new phones
would be able to download your app and
that would mean you to only have about
0.1% of all of the phone users actually
able to download your app so you might
be asking why not make an app for all
phones by picking the oldest version of
the operating system here's a picture of
the first commercially available Android
phone the t-mobile g1 which was also
known outside the United States as the
HTC dream it was released in 2008 and
ran Android 1.0 obviously a lot has
changed since then
for example absolute Google Wallet which
let you pay for groceries of the wave of
your smartphone require a near field
communication a near field communication
or NFC was actually a type of hardware
that didn't make it into Android phones
until 2010 so if you're making an app
that requires NFC there's no reason to
even try supporting older phones like
this that are running older versions of
the Android operating system anyway for
the purposes of your app I want you to
use API 15 which is Ice Cream Sandwich
this should work for about 90 percent of
the phone users out there alright go
ahead and click Next on this screen
you're given a bunch of starting
templates you can choose from depending
on what you're trying to make you're
gonna go ahead and choose blank activity
which is already selected because it's
the simplest one and I'm gonna click
Next finally this screen gives you the
opportunity to name a couple of
different files that are going to be
automatically generated for your
application
as you'll soon see an application is
composed of all the picture files sound
files XML files Java files and more that
are required to make the app basically
there are a lot of files that work
together to make your application we'll
talk about this all soon for now take a
look at the layout name you've been
working on xml layout files so this is
the name of the file we'll be editing in
just a little bit I'm actually not going
to change any of these defaults so you
can go ahead and click finish now
depending on your computer speed it
might take a moment to set everything up
if you looked out here you'll actually
see a little loading circle as well as a
loading bar and we can see a loading
circle down here as well meaning that
it's continuing to think about things so
take a break go ahead stretch and get
some tea or
coffee</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
