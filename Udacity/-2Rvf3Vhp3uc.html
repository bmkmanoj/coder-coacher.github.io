to the same object
that's called aliasing so aliasing in
programs is similar to the way we think
about aliasing in spycraft you might not
be able to tell from my drawing but this
is James Bond and we can refer to James
Bond either by his name James Bond or by
his spy name double-oh-seven both of
those are ways to refer to the same
person
if something happens that changes the
state of James Bond so instead of
pleasantly enjoying a martini like he is
now the bad guys are after him and he
grabbed his gun and is no longer so
happy
well that affects the state of both
James Bond and double-oh-seven both
names refer to the same person
so whatever state that person has is
true for both names aliasing for
variable names has the same property so
if we have two variable names that refer
to the same object any change we make to
the object P refers to also affects the
value that Q refers to so if you did an
assignment using P to change the value
in the second position on P that also
changes the value the name Q refers to
so if we do an assignment like this
where instead of changing the value of
one of the cells that's part of the P
object we assign peeta a new value well
this assignment would create a new
object a list containing three elements
the numbers 0 0 7 and it will change
what the variable P refers to to point
to that new object the value of Q is the
same as it was before it still points to
the same object which we haven't
