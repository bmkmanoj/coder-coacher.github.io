building the document object model can
be fairly complicated but if we're going
to be precise about things that happens
during the page load as it receives HTML
source so even before the page is fully
loaded the browser begins to start
constructing the document object model
one piece at a time other answers I
would consider correct are simply after
HTML has been received or after the page
has been loaded for Part B while the Dom
can be accessed through a variety of
different means the main answer I was
looking for is through its JavaScript
application programming interface since
we're going to be working in the browser
and with JavaScript in this course and
in the third part while you can access
the Dom through JavaScript as I just
mentioned the Dom itself is in a
programming language or JavaScript but
is merely a specification of an
interface the Dom is also a hierarchical
object and what I mean by this is there
has a tree structure and this is due to
the nested nature of HTML itself</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
