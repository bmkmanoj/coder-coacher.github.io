location so you can use just ex-wife
things just translating you can use a
similarity transform which is X Y
rotation theta and a scale that would be
four parameters or you might do an
affine deformation if you're going to
allow things to skew a little bit it
doesn't really matter you just have to
have some model in some way of saying
I'm going to be able to represent these
elements what's my dynamics model well
my dynamics the dynamics model that they
used was actually very simple they said
and this is just written p of l1 given
l0 you could write it as t plus 1 given
T but then I gotta write all these T
plus ones alright and what you see here
is a bunch of independent normal
distributed variables right so what this
says is that the x value is just
normally distributed about the old x
value with some standard with some
variance Sigma squared X same thing with
the y same thing with the theta same
thing with the scale so this is a
similarity transform what it says is
nothing about how I move an ex tells me
anything about how I moved and why
that's the pure Brownian motion so that
can be Illustrated like this right so
here's LT this is where I think the
thing was at any time T and what this
Brownian motion says well at LT plus 1
maybe I'm right nearby maybe i'm at the
same place but oriented differently
maybe i'm over here maybe i'm over there
maybe I'm over there maybe I'm over here
where the likelihood of being any of
those locations depends upon how far
I've moved that's what these things here
say okay so in other words moving
further away from my old y gets less and
less likely what you can do is you can
imagine distributing a whole bunch of
possibilities and that's what's
illustrated here is LT plus 1 and the
idea is that the farther LT plus one is
from l from L T in terms of X Y theta
and scale or any of the other variables
the less likely it is so that's our
dynamics model</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
