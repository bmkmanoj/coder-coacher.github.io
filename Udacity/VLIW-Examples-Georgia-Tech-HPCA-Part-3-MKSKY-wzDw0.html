liw processor the most famous example of
how to probably not do the liw is
Intel's Itanium processors it had tons
of IA features that help the compiler
schedule code well etc as a result the
hardware of the processor became very
complicated it no longer needed to check
for dependencies between instructions
but it had so many other bells and
whistles to do this that the hardware is
probably the most complicated Intel ever
built and yet fundamentally this is
still a viola W processor so it's still
not doing great on a regular code
another example of where viola W is
often use is DSP processors with DSP
stands for digital signal processing
digital signal processing does a lot of
floating-point work typically in a very
regular group with a very small amount
of work within each iteration and lots
of lots of iterations so typically these
types of processors on these types of
codes get excellent performance and
they're also very energy efficient
because they don't spend much power on
figuring out dependencies and so on so
these are examples of when we try to use
VL aw for all types of codes we run into
problems but if we find the type of
codes where compilers can do well
suddenly the Li double looks like a very
very good choice for that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
