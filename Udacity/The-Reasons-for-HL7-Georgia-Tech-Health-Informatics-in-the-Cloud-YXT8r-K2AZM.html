widespread use in the late 1970s and 80s
there were some early attempts to
provide a single vendor fully integrated
hospital-wide solution but most systems
were developed for a particular
Department such as pharmacy clinical lab
or radiology and it was common for each
of these departments to select their own
system as a result hospitals were faced
with the problem of communicating among
those systems so for example patients
could be uniformly registered and
charges could be reliably collected
health level seven hl7 evolved to create
these messaging standards it used eti
x12 to format the messages its latest
version three migrates to XML which as
we discussed earlier is a technology
developed for the Internet in which tags
and HTML formats are used to describe
data elements within web pages while it
is more verbose memory and disk space
are now inexpensive it is more human
readable and of course still machine
readable and it's easily rendered in a
browser</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
