sometimes called indices in strings and
what we want to do is chop up those
strings into sub strings once I know
where the spaces are I can start
splitting a sentence into words the
Python syntax for this is to put square
brackets after the string and the
interpretation is I want to get this
substring that starts at this first
number and goes up to but not including
this last number so here if I'm starting
at 1 and going up to but not including 2
i'll get the e in the l and that's
exactly what we'd get in python you can
also leave out one of these numbers
specifiers and leaving it blank means go
as far as possible in that direction so
here we're starting at position 1 and
going all the way to the right so we get
hello so now that we know how to find
strings and how to chop them up let's
combine that together and write a Python
procedure let's say that you're given
two strings each of which itself
contains two words separated by a space
so these strings might be Bell space
hooks grace space hopper or Alonzo space
Church I'd like you to write a Python
procedure called my first your second
that takes two arguments P and Q and
returns true if the first word in P
equals the second word in Q for example
my first year ii of bell hooks cura bell
would return true because the first word
here matches up with the second word
they're submitted via the interpreter</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
