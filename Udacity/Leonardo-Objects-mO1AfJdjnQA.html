design information was taken by the
Leonardo project at the MCC in the 1980s
they devoted a whole project to
determining what is a suitable set of
design information and some of the
elements that they came up with that go
beyond these we've talked about already
our explicit lists of the stakeholders
involved okay most important is what
issues were raised during the course of
the design and for those issues what
were the possible resolutions and why
was the particular choice made that is
design decisions and the reasons for
making them Leonardo also stressed
various relationships among the design
artifacts such as versions in producing
the system you actually may be producing
several versions that the professional
version and the free version and so on
and what exactly is in each version and
what design compromises had to be made
in order to accommodate multiple
versions there's also the question of
revisions and the time the historical
progress of the design what went into
each of the the revisions along the way
specific descriptions of constraints
upon the solution and how they're being
dealt with is important and what
groupings or aggregates of design
artifacts implementation artifacts
configuration files packaging components
and so on did you decide to use as far
as your solution is concerned</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
