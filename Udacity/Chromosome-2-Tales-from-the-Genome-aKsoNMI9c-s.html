translocation well translocations are
really serious business but there are a
couple of known examples where
translocations have had a net overall
positive effect for humans Oh like what
well let's think of our closest primate
relatives humans are primates and our
closest relatives are chimpanzees
gorillas and orangutans and how many
pairs of chromosomes do you think they
have well I mean if they're our closest
relatives and we have 23 and assume they
had 23 too well you might think that but
you'd be wrong we humans are the
exception we have 23 pairs of
chromosomes and they all have 24 pairs
of chromosomes really they have one more
than we do why is that well take a look
at this image here well it looks like
art chromosome 2 doesn't exist for a
chance and they also have two smaller
ones that's right they have two smaller
chromosomes whereas we have one larger
chromosome now if we look at the
sequence information comparing our big
chromosome 22 their two smaller
chromosomes that we don't have and we
see exactly how their sequences line up
perfectly beside each other matching it
seems so crazy that that could happen
and get passed down well remember it has
to happen in the right cell type so you
tell me what's the right cell type that
matters most in passing DNA on to the
next generation</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
