has limited computational power but does
have active capabilities since they
control the network they can modify
messages going through that router they
could replay messages they could act as
a middle attacker they have lots of
things they can do other than just
intercept and try to analyze intercepted
messages and for most of what we're
going to do we're going to assume this
threat bottle we're going to assume an
attacker who does have limited
computational power that means we'll
assume that encryption and hash
functions work the way they're supposed
to certainly that's not always true that
they could have weaknesses that an
attacker could exploit but when we
design protocols we usually don't need
to pick a particular encryption
algorithm we're going to assume that we
have one that either is a symmetric or
an asymmetric encryption function that
has the properties it should have and
we're going to assume the attackers
active that they can intercept messages
they can try to analyze what they hear
but they can also modify messages and
replay messages and do anything they
could do to disrupt the protocol by
changing things on the network so that's
the main threat model that our protocols
are designed to resist</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
