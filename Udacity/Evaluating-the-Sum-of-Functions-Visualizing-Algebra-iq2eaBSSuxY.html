plus 1 great thinking if you found this
function to find this function we simply
want to add the two functions together
so we'll have 3x plus 24 f of X and
we'll have x squared minus 14 g of x so
notice here is f of X and here's G of X
we're just adding the two functions
together right in the highest power
first off x squared plus 3x plus 1 this
is the result of adding these two
functions together f plus G of X and
let's see this on a graph as well we
have f of X which is our straight line
we have G of X which is our parabola and
then we have f of X plus G of X it turns
out that this is also a parabola and
remember before that we took F of 2
which that Y value was eight and we
added it to G of 2 and that Y value was
three when we add the Y values together
here the value of 3 and here the value
of 8 we get a new value of 11 notice
that the x-coordinate for each of these
points are all the same they're all too
but the y value for this point comes
from adding these two Y values together
so this point came from adding F plus G
of 2 but remember we also found another
point F plus G of 0 we found F plus G of
0 by adding the Y coordinates for here
together we had 0 2 on our orange graph
or f of X and we had 0 negative 1 on our
blue graph G of X so on our new graph F
plus G of X we have the value 0 comma 1
notice that the x coordinates are all
the same and we get this y coordinate
from adding these two y coordinates
together this is f of 0 and this is G of
0 remember that if x equals 0 then the
output for this function
would just be too since 3 times 0 equals
0 and we'd be left with positive 2 so we
know this point is on the graph of F
also we know this point would be on the
graph of G when x equals 0 the output
here is negative 1 so if we want to find
F plus G of 0 we simply add these two
outputs together an output up to and an
output of negative 1 to get an output a
positive one that's where we get this
point from and notice that this is
actually represented for all values of x
any input that we plug in here and here
we have there some this is another way
we can think about the function using a
graph</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
