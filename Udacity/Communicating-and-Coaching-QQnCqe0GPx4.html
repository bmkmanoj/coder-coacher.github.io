to optimally trade off acting and
coordinating and communicating and I
think we can now move on to the topic of
coaching so communicating and coaching
so let's let's imagine instead of the
scenario we talked about before where we
had an agent that you know himself
wanted an apple and wanted to somehow
use communication to to help bring about
a positive outcome let's look more
particularly at this at this case of
okay agent one needs agent to to learn a
particular task like how to fetch an
apple all right and so what we're going
to try to do is figure out how can Agent
one convey the task to agent too if
agent too has its own reward function it
has its own task so we're going to try
to create a task or a reward function
for agent to in some way that is
consistent with agent ones goals okay so
two things one so when you said we're
going to try to create it to you mean
like agent one should try to create a
reward function for agent too right yeah
okay or to convince agent to to create
such a reward function on its own okay
and so second I think the first thing
agent one should do is not tell agent to
that he's trying to teach him to fetch
things I think she'd probably yeah
fetches maybe not fetch is not gonna
happen right you probably you know use
another nicer word but okay I think I'm
with you yeah that's why I said get yeah
except you said fetch yeah it felt like
fetch was a good way all right yes okay
so I agree with you on that okay good so
okay so then so I think I've got the
task ie I want to somehow get ajun to to
get a reward function that will get it
to solve some task that I wanted to
solve or him yeah exactly and so there's
a there's a bunch of different ways of
thinking about this but we're going to
dive into a particular one that I think
is is really interesting and actually
quite useful called inverse
reinforcement learning what okay alright
so let me set this up for you all right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
