actually discussed at the very beginning
of our class which is the idea of threat
modeling and developing a security
mindset which requires us to think like
the people who are going to attack us or
the adversity now I know you've done
some really interesting work in this
area yes so how does one think like that
versuri who well first off I'd say it's
it's almost a guarantee to make you less
popular if you think like that but you
have to a lot involves getting into the
head of someone you think that would
have some purpose that's counter to
yours so if you're designing any system
you have to say well who would be
incentivized for a variety of reasons to
subvert that system and then try to
anticipate who they are and how resource
they are what type of capabilities they
have and then what they could then in
turn do to you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
