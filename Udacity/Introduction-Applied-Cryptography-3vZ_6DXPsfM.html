about symmetric ciphers and how to use
them
symmetric ciphers assume that both
parties have the same key the important
property that makes them symmetric is
that the same key is used for encrypting
and decrypting in some scenarios this is
okay when we talked about using
symmetric ciphers to encrypt a file well
we could assume that the same party is
encrypting and decrypting the file so
they can create and keep the key locally
but when we talk about using symmetric
ciphers for most applications that
involve more than one party this is a
big problem if Alice and Bob want to
talk together well they have to first
agree on this secret key there has to be
a way for Alice and Bob to communicate
that key without exposing it they can't
send it over the insecure Channel if
they could send a secret key over an
insecure Channel well they wouldn't need
encryption at all in the early days this
was done having a secret codebook that
was physically distributed to the
endpoints that were communicating with
Colossus this was the codebook that had
the keys for each day and that was
physically distributed to the Capitol's
where the Lorenz machines were with
enigma this was physically distributed
to all the ships and captains were under
very strict orders to destroy those code
books anytime their ship was in danger
of being captured this was the most
important thing to destroy on the ship
to make sure the enemy didn't capture
the codebook for most applications
especially any civilian application in
the day of the internet distributing a
physical code book or having two parties
meet in a secure place to exchange a key
is not very practical what we want is
some way to establish a secure key or
some way to enable two parties to
communicate that doesn't require that so
that's the main topic of this unit we're
gonna look at different ways that we
could enable this kind of communication
without starting from advanced where
Alice and Bob have a shared key</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
