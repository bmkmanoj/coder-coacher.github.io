user interactions you'll come to rely on
animate with duration a method used to
specify the timing of a change in the
appearance of a view animate with
duration belongs to the class uiview you
I kids generic view class you saw this
method earlier when we discussed
extensions as promised I want to return
to the fade extension demo Xcode project
and dissect the closure expression
syntax open the view controller dot
Swift file and take a look at the Sun
rise and set method focus on the
completion parameter do you recognize
the closure expression syntax here you
can see that the method fade-out takes
in a closure expression as a parameter
the parameter named completion and that
closure expression takes in a bowl as a
parameter and returns void or nothing
the word in lets us know that the body
of the closure is coming up in the body
of the closure we find the code that is
intended to be executed after the
animation is complete that's why this
closure expression is called completion
the body of the closure says if the
image is set to sunset change it to
sunrise if the image is set to sunrise
change it to sunset this call to fade in
is also part of the completion closure
so what's going on here with the
completion parameter for fade in you
might think we'd see another closure
expression here but all we see is no
that nil is standing in for the closure
expression it's saying this is what I
want to happen after the image fades in
I want nothing to happen now let's
switch over to the UI view extensions
file for a second I know I already
pointed this out but I want to reiterate
that this completion parameter actually
has an optional type you can see the
type of the closure expression here as
we just saw it takes in a bowl and
returns void but then notice this ? that
? makes it possible to pass in nil as
the completion parameter</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
