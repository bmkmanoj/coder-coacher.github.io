to stop and ask ourselves what have we
learned okay oh you you're asking me I
am indeed I'm sorry okay well that's not
that's that's not a problem i think i
know the answer so the first thing is we
re learned everything that we learned
from the NDP lesson before so you know
we learned all about scooby-doo MVPs I
don't think that's a kind of mdp it is
now we should write a paper quick and so
that included things like what our
state's and transitions and rewards and
so forth right right I think anything
else uh well I think we learned a bunch
of new things so for me I learned all
about Q functions hmm I learned about
continuations and in general when I
think about that I really learned about
what the bellman equations as opposed to
equation are really trying to capture
for you even more than we did when we
when we talked about them with MVPs all
right so deeper understanding of the
bellman equation and how it relates the
rewards in this infinite sequence of
rewards to each other mmhmm yeah that's
sort of what I was going for yeah and I
think I think that's a lot and I think I
learned that notation matters okay now
remember we talked about the reward in
the in the scooby-doo MVP we talked
about R as a function of s and when we
talked about Q functions and see
functions and the bellman equations we
went to our being SMA and even though we
had mentioned before that they were
mathematically equivalent it turns out
just like sometimes thinking about Q
sometimes thinking about see might be
better than thinking about VR you it
turns out that sometimes thinking about
our s of a is better than thinking about
our vests even if they really are
mathematically equivalent and in some
sense it doesn't matter though right
because we actually were able to do
similar things with the RS as we are
with the RSA true although you know what
that's not really notation right that's
notation is you doing the instead of you
this is really representation
representation matters yeah and I think
that's actually pretty important lesson
and when I think about some of the other
things that we know about reinforcement
learning the representation is going to
make a huge difference I think that's
right I think that's a good lesson for I
don't know I want to say a I in general
but certainly machine learning okay well
that's like a profound point to end on
alright cool so we'll pick it up with
reinforcement learning next time done
let's do that have a good time Michael
