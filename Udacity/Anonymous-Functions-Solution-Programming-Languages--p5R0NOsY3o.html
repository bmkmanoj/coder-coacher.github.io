is just the word function this is to
separate it from a number like three or
four and to allow us to tell if the user
mistakenly tries to call something
that's not a function later we then list
the parameters which we got right from
the abstract syntax tree the body of the
function which we also got right from
the abstract syntax tree and the
environment in which it was defined this
one env and we're passing an env here
instead of some global environment or
whatnot and this is what's going to
allow local functions to see local
variables this is why things like make
greeter work they can refer back to
variables that were currently in scope
when they were defined now many of you
may notice a striking similarity between
this and our previous code for handling
function declarations in fact our
previous code just had one more step
where we added this value to the
environment for an anonymous function we
don't add it to the environment unless
the user assigns it but this code should
look really really familiar we have
something almost exactly like it for
handling functions at the top level as
JavaScript elements</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
