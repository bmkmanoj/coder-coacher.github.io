architectural evolution occurs in
practice ideally when a system evolves
its prescriptive architecture should be
modified first just like when you modify
a building you change the blueprint and
then you change the actual building you
don't go the other way around in
software
unfortunately this rarely happens in
practice in practice the system and
therefore it's descriptive architecture
are often directly modified like in this
case and I'm showing here so what
happens is that the architecture as
conceived does not change whereas the
architecture as implemented does change
and therefore these two things start
diverging and this really happens for a
number of reasons so I'm just gonna list
a few of those reasons here in some
cases it just happens for plain
sloppiness I need to make this
modification I don't really want to go
back and look at the prescriptive
architecture modified I'm just gonna
make the change and maybe I'll fix the
description later and then you never
really get to it
in other cases you do this because of
the perception of short deadlines if you
have to do something by this afternoon
you're not going through a formal
software architecture review you
normally just get to it and do it in
some cases a prescriptive architecture
is not even present so there's a lack of
documentation so in this case is clearly
you cannot go and modify something that
does not even exist and so you jump
directly to the code and start modifying
that and as I said there's a many many
more other reasons why that happen but
the important point here is that it does
happen and it does happen often and the
result is that prescriptive and
descriptive architectures
diverge</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
