RPC latency by now we are all familiar
with the semantics of RPC namely in an
RPC the client is making a remote
procedure call to a server and it has to
send the arguments of the call to the
server so that the server can execute
the server procedure and return the
results back to the client so if you
look at the components of the RPC
latency its charge of the client with a
client call so the client call subsumes
a number of things number one it is
setting up the arguments for the call
the client has to set up the arguments
for the procedure call and then it makes
a call into the kernel and once the
colonel has been informed that it wants
to make this call the colonel validates
the call and then marshals the arguments
into a network packet and sets up the
controller to actually do the network
transmission their entire set of
activities that the client program and
the colonel is involved in in getting
ready and network packet to send out is
subsumed in this one line which I say is
a client call the second part of the
latency is the controller latency and
this is the part where the controller
says well there is a message to be sent
out I know where it is in memory I have
to first DMA that message into my buffer
and then put the message out on the wire
that's the controller latency and so
this part of it is in hardware and as
operating system designer we're going to
take what the hardware gives us control
latency is what you have that given by
the hardware the third part of the
latency is the time on the wire now this
really depends as one might imagine on
the distance between the client and the
server the limiting factor of course the
speed of light so depending on the
bandwidth that's available between the
source and the destination perhaps if
you have to go through intermediate
routers and so on it is going to take a
certain amount of time to go from the
client to the server machine and that we
call as the time on the wire so then the
message arrives oh
we're on the destination node and it
arrives in the form of an interrupt to
the operating system so the interrupt
has to be handled by the operating
system and part of handling the
interrupt is moving the bits that come
in on the wire into the controller
buffer and from the controller buffer
into the memory of the node so all of
that activity is subsumed in this item
number four which i call as the
interrupt handling so once the interrupt
handling is complete then we can set up
the server procedure to execute the
original call now what is involved in
that well you have to locate the server
procedure and once you locate the server
procedure you have to dispatch the civil
procedure and once you dispatch the
server procedure you have two unmarked
package that comes in as the actual
arguments for the call that the server
procedure has to execute so all of that
setup is first done and then the server
procedure can actually execute the call
so this is the five-step process from
the time the client says I want to make
an RPC call to the point of actually
executing the call these are the layers
of software and of course hardware and
time on the wire by which time you're
ready to execute the server procedure so
even though it looks like a simple
procedure called from the clients point
of view there is all this latency to be
incurred in executing animal procedure
call so at the end of step 5 the server
is all set to execute the procedure
let's see what happens then so step
number six is server execution meaning
that it is actually executing the
procedure and of course this is not
under our control is operating system
designer because at this point the
amount of time that the server is going
to execute this procedure depends really
on the logic of the program that has
been written as a client-server program
and then finally once the server
procedure is completed execution then it
says okay I'm ready to send the reply
back to the client and that's where we
pick up again so what happens is that at
that point you're receiving the results
so once again just
like when the client wanted to send the
arguments you have to convert the actual
arguments into a network packet and send
it out on the wire similarly when the
server is ready to reply you take that
reply which is the results of the
execution of this procedure and make it
in a network packet and at this point
once it has been made into the network
packet it has to be handed over to the
controller and the controller does
exactly what we did on this side which
is to say the controller latency is
going to be incurred so that's why you
see item number two appearing all over
again in the return path similar to
sending the arguments over to the server
on the wire the results have to be sent
on the wire back to the client and so
you see that item number three which is
the time on the wire is reappearing on
the return path as well come over to
this side the incoming result message is
going to result in a an interrupt on the
receiving node the client node and that
is exactly similar to what happened on
the server side item number four so you
see number item number four reappearing
on the return path as well so that is
the interrupt handling part and once
that interrupt is handled the operating
system on the client side says oh this
was on behalf of this client let me read
this patch the client set up the client
so that the client can then receive the
results and restart execution where it
left off so the only two new things that
we added in the return path was item
number 6 and 7 2 3 and 4 was exactly the
same as what we saw on the way over to
the server and that is being repeated on
the way back to the client so that's the
seventh step latency involved in the RPC
not worrying about the actual execution
time of the server code itself because
that is not in the purview of the
operating system it is in the purview of
the client-server program that the app
developer has done</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
