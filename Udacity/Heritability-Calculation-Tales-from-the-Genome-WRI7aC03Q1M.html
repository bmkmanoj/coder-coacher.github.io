you wonderful biology students out there
but I want to throw one more big cool
calculation on you one way of actually
measuring or estimating heritability is
to compare the correlation of a trait
between monozygotic twins and dizygotic
twins now there are multiple equations
out there that people use to estimate or
calculate heritability but one of the
ones that's relevant to what we've
learned so far is using the correlations
between monozygotic and dizygotic twins
for trait and this is the equation here
heritability is equal to two times the
monozygotic correlation - the dizygotic
correlation now the chief assumptions
here are that monozygotic twins are
twice as genetically identical as
dizygotic twins right
dizygotic twins are 50% identical and
monozygotic twins are a hundred percent
genetically identical and that's where
this two comes in outside the
parentheses because monozygotic twins
are twice as identical or two times as
identical as dizygotic twins so if our
heritability is low if it's under 0.5 it
means that variation in the trait
reflects environmental influences
because the dizygotic correlation
roughly equals the monozygotic
correlation so we're getting a much
lower number from our equation but if
variation chiefly reflects genetic
influences then the correlation between
monozygotic twins is going to be much
higher than dizygotic twins so we're
gonna get a much higher heritability
value so let's look at the heritability
of a trait like height so here we have
amount as I got a correlation 2.95 and
dizygotic correlation 2.5 to 5 so if we
plug these numbers into our equation we
get a heritability of 0.85 and this is
actually the heritability of height in
developed countries does this mean that
the environment or the genome plays a
larger role in determining the
variability of the trade of height use
this heritability value to decide your
response</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
