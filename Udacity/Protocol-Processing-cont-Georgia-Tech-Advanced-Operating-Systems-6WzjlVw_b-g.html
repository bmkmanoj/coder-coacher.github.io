semantics of RPC the client has made the
call and the client is blocked and since
the client is blocked we don't need to
buffer the message on the client side if
the message gets lost for some reason
you don't hear back the results of the
RPC from the destination in a certain
amount of time you can resend the call
from the client side and therefore you
don't have to buffer the client side RPC
message but you can reconstruct the
client side message and resend the call
therefore client-side buffering is
something that you can get rid of once
again because the land is reliable the
next source of overhead similar to the
client side buffering happens on the
server side and that is the server is
sending the results and the results may
get lost Lana's reliable may not happen
that often but it could happen and
therefore we knew won't do the buffering
on the server side because if we don't
buffer it then you have to be execute
the server procedure to produce the
result and that's not something that you
want to do because it involves react
securing the server procedure which may
be much more latency intensive than
simply buffering the packet that
corresponds to the result of executing
the civil procedure so you do want to
buffer on the server side but that
buffering on the server side can be
overlapped with the transmission of the
message so in other words the result has
been computed by the server procedure
now go ahead and send the result while
you are sending the results back to the
client do the buffering that you can
overlap the server side buffering with
the result transmission and get it out
of the critical path of the latency for
protocol processing so removing
low-level acts employing hardware checks
and we're not doing checksum and
software eliminating client-side
buffering altogether and overlapping the
server side buffering was the result
transmission our optimizations that you
can do in protocol processing
recognizing that the land is reliable
and therefore we don't have to focus so
much on the reliability of message
transmission but focus
rather on the latency and how we can
reduce the latency by making the
protocol processing lean and meet</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
