distributed at each node the transaction
manager is responsible for all the
client-server interactions that touches
that particular node for example the
client that this node could have done
the following it could have opened the
window for reading Gmail it could have
opened a window in which is accessing a
file for editing
now the transaction manager at node a
has to manage the transaction trees
corresponding to each of the
client-server interactions that is
initiated by this client opening a
window for Gmail is one interaction
opening another window which is
accessing a file for editing is another
interaction the transaction manager is
responsible for maintaining the
transaction trees for each one of those
separately
and the transaction manager were the
client-server interaction originates is
the owner as well as the coordinator but
it is designated Bill to some other node
as I mentioned already and there is a
graph structure for the transaction tree
and this is very useful in terms of
reducing network communication because
all the transaction managers that form
this interaction don't have to always
communicate with the coordinator for
instance the transaction managers at
node C and D have been contacted because
of IPC that originated at node B to node
C and D respectively in that case they
only have to report to node B and they
don't have to necessarily report to
coordinator of the whole transaction
tree so this is helpful in reducing the
amount of network communication all
transaction managers are not equal I
mentioned earlier that brittle nodes in
the system are the client nodes and
therefore it is possible that a
transaction manager that originated at a
client node may designate the
coordinated to be a more robust node
like the file server and there are
different kinds of failures that can
happen there could be a failure of a
participant node in the transaction or
there could be a connection failure or
it is possible that one of the sub
transaction manager failed to report all
of these are sources of failure now one
of the things that the transaction
manager at each node has to do is to log
periodically to persistent store state
that is created on behalf of the client
or on behalf of the server whatever is
happening at that node this transaction
manager is responsible for creating
checkpoint records for recoverability
reasons and these checkpoint Records
will be useful for warding off against
failures or partial recovery of work so
in a distributed system failures can
happen at any point if for instance this
node fails then the transaction manager
at this node has also failed and this is
something that this transaction manager
is going to find out about because it
doesn't hear any response from this
transaction manager but a transaction
represented by this graph here is not
aborted at the first indication of
failure of a node and the reason is
because you don't want error reporting
to stop as a result of failure you want
the transaction to be aborted only upon
termination as requested by the
transaction manager the coordinator of
the transaction tree and the reason is
as I said to make sure that partial
failures they may have left states you
want to clean up all of that and that
will happen when the coordinator
initiates termination of the transaction
we'll see that in a minute</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
