of finding a path from v1 to v2 to the
idea of finding a shortest path from v1
to all their nodes and one of the
reasons we want to do that is to
identify central nodes in a social
network nodes that are likely to have a
lot of influence are well placed are
very well connected and so we're gonna
look now at the question of given a node
v1 how central is it now it turns out
there's lots of different ways that you
can define what central means we're
gonna right now focus on a particular
one which is the average shortest path
length to all the other nodes so to find
this quantity we're going to need to
calculate the the shortest path length
from v1 to all the other nodes now based
on the analyses we've done so far
finding the shortest path length from
some node v1 to some other specific node
b2 takes time big theta of n plus M the
nodes plus edges so following sort of a
naive kind of algorithm design well this
this should work and it's not so
terrible it's to say well if we want to
know the shortest distance from v1 to
each of the other nodes in the graph we
can just repeat this process once for
each possible target node so we do it
for we find the shortest path from v1 to
v2 &amp;amp; from v1 to v3 and v1 to v4 and B 1
to B 5 and we can get all those
distances and then say average them to
get this measure of centrality the
running time for that approach is going
to be big theta of n the number of nodes
times the time that it takes to do a
shortest path search so it's really n
times n plus M which is N squared and M
down the superhero data that we're
looking at at the moment
has on the order of 6,000 superhero
nodes so and 6000 squared is you know a
substantial number and we be nice to
avoid this if we could so here are some
choices for you one possibility is you
can't just deal with it
and this is the fastest way to do it
which is essentially to repeat
individual pairwise searches until
you've exhausted all the nodes
another possibility is well you can make
it faster by just using a smaller graph
another choice would be well you're
searching for for v1 we're not sure what
to search for just search for something
that's not anywhere in the graph and
last choice is actually you can speed
things up by doing the search backwards</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
