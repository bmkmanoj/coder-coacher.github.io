of the transcription initiation site
though they don't always have to be this
serves an obvious purpose as a landing
platform for all the proteins that come
together to initiate transcription at
this spot here remember in the cellular
world proteins make the world go round
now there's a generic class of proteins
referred to as transcription factors
which are just proteins that bind DNA
and regulate the initiation of
transcription as you can imagine many of
these proteins many of these
transcription factors essentially bind
in this promoter region and physically
regulate the initiation of transcription
via chemistry now not only can these
proteins interact with the DNA at the
promoter region but they interact with
each other as well you can sort of see
that depicted here they're all bound to
one another and through these many
interactions they're able to facilitate
the overall outcome for this particular
gene now although this is ultimately
chemistry we've become pretty good at
representing chemistry with our letter
symbols let's imagine that one of these
transcription factors appear one of
these proteins is actually binding to a
very specific sequence here in the DNA
TGA cgt CA let's just say there was a
change in the sequence here so that this
g is missing there's a there's a small
deletion let's say and now the sequence
reads TGA CTCA do you think this change
in the DNA sequence at a promoter region
would result in the transcription factor
binding more tightly less tightly or not
at all</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
