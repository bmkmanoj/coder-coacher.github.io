and we'll play around with it in our
browser so right now these three radio
buttons have three different names let's
give them all the same name so instead
of being Q R and s we're going to make
them q q and q okay
we save this we go to our browser and
reload the page now we have our three
radio buttons again and now when I
select the first one it behaves as we
expect it and I select the second one
and it unselect the first one so that's
cool so now we can only select one
option and things work as we expected
and when I submit the form we see that Q
equals on because that was the name of
the inputs now we have a major downside
to this is that no matter which radio
button I selected q still says it's
equal to on so that's not particularly
helpful because we want to know which
radio button is selected well that is
what the value parameter is for and
let's take a look at that here we are in
our editor again and we're going to
learn about another parameter this one's
called value so I'm going to add a value
parameter to each of these inputs make
the first one b1 and I'll make the
second one b2 and I'll make the third
one b3 so now we have type radio' name
equals Q for all three of these but the
first radio button has a value one
second has value two and the third one
has value three let's go ahead and try
this out on our browser
okay I've reloaded the form and now I'm
going to select one of these radio
buttons let's go with the second one and
I would like you to tell me what happens
when I click Submit so what will the
value of the Q parameter in the URL be
when the form is submitted of the second
radio button selected</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
