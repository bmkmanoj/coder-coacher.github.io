discs an optical disc is very similar to
a hard disk in that it has a platter
that rotates and we store the bits on
the surface of the disc the difference
is that instead of there being a head
that needs to be placed very close to
the disk surface we can shoot a laser to
the surface and the reflection from the
material here will tell us whether we
have a 0 or a 1 but many of the other
properties of the optical discs are very
similar to hard disks they have tracks
and so on unlike hard drives that tend
to be closed units so you don't just
insert a new hard drive into the machine
and you don't carry one with you usually
optical drives don't need the laser to
get that close to the surface so the
smudges or dust are less of a problem
for it basically if there is a speck of
dust here it doesn't scratch the laser
as it rotates but a speck of dust will
scratch the magnetic head as it rotates
and probably glue itself to the head and
then the head no longer works so hard
drives have much more of a problem with
dirt so they need to be in an enclosed
case because optical discs suffer less
from this problem we often see them in
the form of CDs and DVDs that we can
carry around and even though they get
dirty we can still read data from them
but as a result of them being portable
they need to be standardized so that we
can put a CD or a DVD into any Drive
that we want and the standardization
helps improve Portability and their
usefulness but it limits the rate of
improvement because the technology
improves but then that technology needs
to make it through a standards process
where companies agree that something
will be a standard and only then make it
into products so really the technology
can improve relatively rapidly but we
don't see any of that progress until a
new standard is decided on at which
point products are released in contrast
with hard drives the whole enclosure
needs to obey some standards about how
to connect to the rest of the computer
but what happens inside the enclosure
can be the latest and greatest
technology in magnetic discs so usually
optical discs are used for pretty much
carrying the data around storing music
movies and so on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
