we have a structure that represents the
variable x1 we have a structure that
represents the variable x2 and a
structure that represents the variable
x3 here and we have a class that say it
goes like this x1 or not x2 or x3 and
what we said with regards to the past
between a and B we said that going this
way means true and going this way means
false so what we'll do now is we have x1
here in this clause we will connect this
vertex over here and over here what that
means is that we can visit this vertex
here for just one extra edge as long as
we're taking the path that means x 1 is
true here this is not right because we
have not x2 so we have to connect it in
another way we have to connect it in
exactly the reverse way because then
when we take the path that means x 2 is
set to false then not x2 becomes true
and again in that case we would want to
be able to visit this vertex here for
just one extra edge now my question to
you is how would I have to connect this
vertex here to this part here of the
graph that represents x3 would I have to
connect it in this way or would I have
to connect it in this way so please
check the one that is correct</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
