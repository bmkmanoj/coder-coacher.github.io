of this proof to show that 3
colorability is np-hard we're gonna show
that if we had the ability to solve 3
colorability problems in polynomial time
then we could solve 3sat problems in
polynomial time as well and so what we
need to be able to do to show that is if
you walk up to me with any 3-cnf formula
i can quickly turn it into a 3
colorability problem which is going to
be a graph such that that graph is 3
colorable if and only if the original
formula the 3-cnf formula that were
given is satisfiable
so CNF here just means conjunctive
normal form it's just that that form
that I showed you before where the
formula is the end of a bunch of clauses
and each Clause is the or of three
literals and each literal is either
variable or its negation not that
variable so you walk up to me with a
3-cnf problem I turn that into a 3
colorability problem that can be
coloured if and only if the formula is
satisfiable sounds like an interesting
challenge so let's get to it
what we're gonna be doing is building a
graph we'll start off by creating some
nodes with one node for every possible
literal in the formula so that's the K
different variables oh let's say this
just to be concrete this formula that we
come to has K variables and s clauses
then we're going to add three more nodes
and we'll call them true false and slack
and we're gonna connect up the nodes
initially as follows each literal will
be connected to slack including true and
false and we're going to connect true
and false to each other what that means
because this there's a little triangle
here and we're only we're trying to see
whether or not it's 3 colorable the only
way that this thing can be 3 colorable
is if these three are given three
different colors so just for
concreteness let's say that the color
that slack gets is red the color that
true gets is blue true blue and the
color that false gets is black black
false one all right so what the graph
that we have so far has the property
that each of these literals is going to
be going to have to be colored either
true or false blue or black if if we're
gonna three color the whole graph so
that's good that kind of makes it seem
like they're actually getting truth
assignments we have to be a little
careful though because literal v1 and
literal not v1 can't both be true and
they can't both be false but that's an
easy thing to fix in a graph color
ability problem we just connect them
with an edge so if we add one edge for
each variable connecting the pair of
literals that can't both be true and
both be false now what happens is the
only way that we can three color this is
if each variable is given blue for
either the variable and black for its
negation or black for the variable and
blue for the negation and that's like a
truth assignment a true/false assignment
to that variable so any possible truth
assignment corresponds to a three
coloring any possible three coloring
corresponds to a truth assignment so so
far we're in really good shape as far as
capturing the idea the physics of a Sat
problem</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
