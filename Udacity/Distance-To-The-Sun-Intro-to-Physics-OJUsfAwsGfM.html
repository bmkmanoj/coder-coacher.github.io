calculated the size of the earth and the
moon and the distance from the earth to
the moon might as well figure out the
distance to the Sun as well right let's
look at a picture here's the earth
here's the moon over here we have the
Sun now let me say again this is not to
scale the Sun should be much larger and
much further away than depicted here the
moon should be further away as well now
the picture of John here is a very
special alignment of the Earth Moon and
Sun this is what's called a half moon
the reason why is the Sun is striking
the moon and based on this geometry you
can only strike this side of the moon
well it's always only striking half of
the moon what makes this so special well
what's special is from Earth if we look
up we just see everything on this side
of this blue line everything below this
blue line and as you can see everything
to the left of this dividing line is in
the light and everything on the other
side to the right is not so to us this
actually appears like a half moon even
though the moon is always only half
illuminated this is the one special
geometry where we only see half of the
visible side illuminated to us so we've
got the special geometry that happens
about twice a month and what makes it
special you can maybe guess we can draw
a right triangle between the earth the
Sun and the moon in the previous problem
you calculate this distance and I'm not
going to tell you exactly what we
calculated but let's say it's very close
to 400,000 kilometers that's the
distance from the earth to the moon now
we can actually measure this angle
you've probably seen those strange days
where the Sun and the moon are both in
the sky I know this seems weird the
moon's supposed to be out at night Sun
in the day but hey it happens like this
sometimes when it does happen like this
and it happens to be a half moon we can
measure this angle and then well I think
you see where we're going you can
measure this distance hell this actually
turns out to be a really really large
angle so this angle which I'll call
alpha alpha is actually equal to 80 9.85
3
degrees so given this number and this
distance between the Earth and the moon
can you tell me what this L is the
distance between the Sun and the earth
give your answer in kilometers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
