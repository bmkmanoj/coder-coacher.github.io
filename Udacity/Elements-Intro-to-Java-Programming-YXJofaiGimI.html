those objects the elements of the list
here's one way of thinking about an
ArrayList you can think of it as a
sequence of mailboxes here is how you
get an element out of an ArrayList
remember that gallery was an ArrayList
of pictures the get method can get a
picture out of that collection the
argument of the get method is called an
index and as it happens in Java the
index values start with 0 so the first
element is at position 0 the second
element is at position 1 the third at
position 2 and so on the get method
returns the elements stored at the index
position in our case that's the initial
element and we store that in this
variable what if we wanted to get at the
last element then we need to know how
many elements are stored in the
ArrayList at this time the size method
tells us that so gallery dot size is the
number of elements that's currently
stored in this particular array list
since the first index is zero the last
index is 1 less than the size look at
over here this list here has length 5
and the last element has index 4 now
once we have the last index we can again
use the get method passing as the last
index to get the last element out of
here here you've seen how to access
elements individually more often than
not you actually want to access all of
the elements in a loop so let's have a
look at that in order to work with every
element in an ArrayList you want to call
the get method for every valid index
that means 0 1 2 and so on up to the
size minus 1 so here's what we need to
put into our for loop I starts at 0 it
gets incremented at every step and we
stay in the loop while I is less than
the size of the ArrayList so this is the
classic loop to traverse all of the
elements in an ArrayList
i takes every legal index value for each
i we get the element stored in the
ArrayList and then we do something with
that element you'll get to try that
right now go ahead
and right a group that draws every
picture in the gallery</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
