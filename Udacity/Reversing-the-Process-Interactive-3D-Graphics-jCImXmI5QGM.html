track all the photons in a scene to
avoid this level of computation in
computer graphics we make a number of
simplifying assumptions first only those
photons that reach the camera are the
ones needed to make the image so these
are the only ones we would like to
compute we know which objects we can see
but how do we know in advance which
photons will matter each photon is
generated by light source but we don't
know where each ends up so we reverse
the process instead of sending photons
from the light
we essentially cast a ray from the eye
through each pixel and see what's out
there when a surface is seen at a pixel
we then compute the direct effect of
each light on that surface add up all
the light contributions and you have a
reasonable approximation of what the
surface looks like one more
approximation can be used for these
lights noting blocks them every surface
is considered visible to a light unless
it faces away from that light source in
other words no objects cast shadows this
simplification saves us a lot of
computation rendering can get even
simpler than this for example you could
do away with lights all together and
just draw each object with a solid color
however I'm drawing the line there as
the lights add considerable realism and
perception of 3d to a scene for example
look at the scene without lights so
there are two extremes at one end
photons are carefully traced from light
emitters through a scene potentially
giving a highly realistic image at the
other end the camera determines what
gets viewed in a rough approximation of
what light reaches each surface is
determined this process can be
unrealistic but can be computed
extremely fast we'll start with the
second extreme and in later lessons show
how we can remove or modify various
simplifications so the more photon based
computations are performed such as
casting shadows</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
