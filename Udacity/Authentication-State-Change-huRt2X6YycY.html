login function but now what the app
looks exactly the same yeah well the
firebase database knows you're logged in
but the Android app doesn't and
therefore it isn't doing anything
different so I've got access to this off
data object immediately when the user
logs in I'm just not sure what the best
thing to do with it is oh yes sheesh I'm
just reading about this there's actually
a couple ways you can get information
from firebase about the users
authentication state besides just the on
authenticated call back interesting tell
us more sure let me screen share so you
want to keep track of users
authentication States and for that there
are several methods you can use a
callback method an event listener or
specifically retrieve the current
authentication data for a user you've
already learned about on authenticated
with this method you can trigger code as
soon as the user logs in but sometimes
you might move to different activities
in the app and continue to need the
users authentication state you can use
an authentication state listener just
like the normal firebase listeners will
tell you exactly when data changes in
the firebase database an authentication
state change listener will tell you
exactly when firebase knows a user is
logged in or logged out and when you
don't need the listener you can use
remove off state listener to remove it
the get off method retrieves
authentication data for the currently
authenticated user or null if the user
is not authenticated this method is
synchronous which is useful when
restricting access to valid users of
your application</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
