was when I was doing my undergrad thesis
I was learning about the effects of
language loss and its toll it's taken on
my identity being Miwok and not knowing
the language or the traditions it really
felt I don't know the word for it would
be you know inadequate you know I don't
know much about my my heritage my
culture and I want to know more and I
want to be able to pass that knowledge
down to my children so I started looking
into basket weaving a little bit of the
language I started interviewing my
grandmother and my mother and trying to
get as much information I could from my
closest family members but then I found
a website that was built by one of the
tribal members and had certain audio
clips of you know counting and colors
and things like that and I started
playing with it with my son and he would
we would click on the numbers and before
I would click the next one wait let me
try to say it so I can I can see if I
can say it right and you know it just
went from like a game that my son and I
played and I wanted to do more with that
and I figured that a lot of families are
kind of in the same situation we are
we're in the Bay Area which isn't which
is about two hours away from the tribal
community and if there are more people
who are far enough away it's not
accessible to them so let's bring the
language to the people</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
