doing tonight I'm doing well thank you
how are you I'm doing just fine thank
you so much for asking but I do have a
question and what is that why are we
here why are we here why are we here
because we're teaching a class on
reinforcement learning but we've already
taught a class on reinforcement learning
we taught a class on machine learning
and there was a section of that class on
reinforcement learning so it's a kind of
a mini course okay but we've done this
already so why would we be doing this
again the idea was that when we were
doing the mini course last time there
was all sorts of topics that we didn't
get to go into depth on and it's a topic
that that's really interesting to us so
we thought we could just kind of expand
it out and do a whole class okay that
seems reasonable but you haven't
convinced me that this is really a whole
class and that we're doing something
different so what are we doing this
difference so well mostly we're going to
just be going more deeply into the
theory and practice of reinforcement
learning
okay well half of that sounds
interesting oh good so on the theory
side we're gonna be studying things like
the convergence of algorithms how how
long it takes them to converge whether
you can put bounds on how many mistakes
it's gonna make before it converges
situations in which you don't have
convergence these are all sorts of
really how are you talking I'm sorry
what about the practice side all right
so on the practice side we're gonna be
doing a lot more in terms of
implementations of reinforcement
learning algorithms and we're gonna do
for each lesson some kind of exercise we
reuse a system that we built called
burlap the sorts of topics we're going
to talk about include things like
temporal difference learning like the TD
lambda algorithm oh I like T V lambda I
actually did a thesis on that once oh
nice okay okay so you should be
interested in hearing about that or
maybe even talking about that we're also
going to be talking about how you can
express things using reward functions
which is a really important topic in
reinforcement learning because all of
the way that we communicate with the
algorithms is in terms of their
incentives in the form of rewards I like
that that makes a lot of sense it sort
of the practical things that matter
about making a reinforcement learning
actually work in the wild let's do that
I like that what else we should be
talking about generalization and scaling
to some degree oh I like that I want to
talk about generalization and scaling
and I want to tie it back into
abstraction oh that's a really important
topic great okay cool can I do that
sure why don't you do that piece and
I'll talk about partially observable
Markov decision processes which is just
making when you don't have complete
knowledge of what the current state of
the environment okay that seems
reasonable I'll trade you you can do pom
VP's if you let me do options okay all
right and Monte Carlo methods okay it's
a deal but we're also going to talk
about game theory which is awesome
because it has theory right there in the
name okay that's true but it also has
game right there in the name and that's
what makes it cool it should be fun for
everyone yes fun for the whole family so
in the game theory section were actually
gonna harken back to things that we did
in the previous mini course but then
we're gonna update it by giving more
details about different solution
concepts all right that's right last
time we did this class we talked about
all these things besides Nash equilibria
that we're really interesting and so
we're gonna have a chance to talk about
that now yep good so can we do can we do
correlative equilibrium you can do
correlated equilibrium I'll do
correlated equilibria sounds good
alright so were you ready to go I think
I'm ready to go so let's go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
