tradeoff in this lesson and the last
lesson now I want you to hear from Sean
here about his work at Facebook and pay
careful attention to his models and the
trade-offs and the visualizations he
made some recent work I've been doing on
measuring fan sentiment for NFL teams
over the course of the season that I'm
really excited about it's it's been a
really fun project because I myself am
an FFL fan I'm a huge Eagles fan and I
go through all the emotions that a fan
goes through over the course of the
season you know the highs of when your
team wins and then the lows after a
couple losses in a row of feeling kind
of hopeless and so I got the idea of
maybe we could measure this and kind of
tell a story not just for my team but
for all the other teams in the NFL and
come up with some idea some way of
visualizing this this experience of
being a fan and so I I counted ratios of
positive to negative words at five
minute increments over the course of the
whole four months of the NFL season and
because we're taking a ratio we end up
with some measurements that are
extremely high like you know positive to
negative word ratios over a hundred even
though the average is somewhere in the
two to three range so this this was kind
of like a first cut at the data and we
could see that there's some signal here
but it's it's definitely going to need
some some modeling or some statistics in
order to kind of tease out what's
actually happening so the next step that
I did was just compute a moving average
of these 5-minute measurements and we
start to get a little bit of signal out
of there because we're pulling over more
measurements so the measurements
themselves are more reliable and we end
up with a series that kind of tells a
little bit of a story but these
measurements are still too frequent and
too noisy to really tell a story about
what's happening when we aggregated up
to one day moving averages we start to
see some patterns emerge I guess one of
the key features of this data set was
that I knew what I was looking for ahead
of time because I I am an Eagles fan I
experienced the highs and lows of the
seasons I can look at a plot like this
immediately and tell you this is not
telling the story that I want we need to
maybe apply some modeling to that we
want a model that predicts sentiment as
a function of time and then one of the
things that comes to mind right away is
a natural spline you can see this
actually tells a nice story these
colored lines are the dates of wins and
losses it kind of gives you an idea of
why the lines are upward sloping or
downward something so you see here kind
of like the exuberance at the beginning
of the season and as people are really
optimistic
and then you know three losses in a row
and you see how the sentiment dips this
tells a nice story but it doesn't have
the feature of that we'd expect which is
that on game day things change really
abruptly at the very end of the game
when you know if you wanted your won or
you've lost you're much happier much
sadder than you were at the beginning of
the game so we expect to see really
discrete jumps and sentiment that we
don't see from a model like this and
this is because this is a bad model of
the underlying data generating process
so we need something more flexible one
way to do that is just to use a
seven-day moving average which is going
to allow us to include only kind of the
last games sentiment in the in the
moving average so we're gonna stick a
moving average like I showed you before
but smooth it out into over a whole
seven day period and when we do that we
get something that actually tells a
really nice story about the season and
has all the kind of characteristics that
I would expect as a fan and having gone
through this which is the kind of the
big bumps up on game days where you win
the big bumps down on game days where
you lose and then kind of these plateaus
in-between which are these periods of
stability when you you don't have a new
information about how your team is doing
we see the a week off around
Thanksgiving but then there's this big
spike in happiness because people are
just happier on Thanksgiving this big
low point right after a loss that could
have knocked them out of the playoffs
and then a big kind of ascension into
their their playoff game which they
ended up losing kind of the subsequent
dip this I think is a really nice
depiction of what happened and it just
took a little bit of averaging to get
this story to come out when you're
looking at all this data what sort of
things come up for you in terms of bias
and variance trade-offs when you're
computing just a simple moving average
like this you're dealing with one of the
most it's just a really flexible
statistic and so you're you're not
imposing any structure on the data
you're letting the data kind of speak
when I use a moving average here and
I've plotted standard errors that we're
kind of rolling along with the data they
were gigantic the mean sentiment for the
season is somewhere in the three range
and the standard errors were over two or
three we can say very precisely what's
happening at any given point but our
variance on that estimate is huge so as
we started to add more lags a higher
number of lags to the moving average we
end up with kind of smoother looking
plots that have
or variants but then are getting
progressively more biased so as we go
back further we're including more data
and we're getting more biased because
we're including data from parts that
actually aren't applicable to that exact
point but in exchange for that we get a
lower variance lot one that doesn't move
is as wildly we combine that with
splines you can end up fitting a model
that has kind of the best of both worlds
which has the smoothing aspects of the
splines with the discrete jumps of what
happens on game day and so this is a
spline where we add in dummy variables
for postgame periods in this model we
end up with kind of all the same things
we get the big jumps that we expect so
jumps down on losses jumps up on game
days where they win and then also kind
of the smooth transitions in between so
it's kind of a nice story of taking one
style of model which is a spline which
is just too specific for the data
generating process and maybe not a good
fit and then doing some exploratory data
analysis where we see that averaging
over seven days tells a really nice
story and gives us the discreteness that
we want and then combining those two
together into kind of an aggregate of
the two types of models where we're able
to better account for the fact that game
days are an important thing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
