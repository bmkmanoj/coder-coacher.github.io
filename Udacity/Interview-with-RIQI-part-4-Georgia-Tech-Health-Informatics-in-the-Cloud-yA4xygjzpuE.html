care from you and others here at the
Rhode Island quality Institute so that I
want to come back to you and let's look
out in the future I mean what what what
do you see as the future of current care
and of hie and is there anything that
you really want our students to take
away from this interview I think that
hie s have focused historically on
providing information to physicians
hospitals providers long-term care and
so forth by the time they see this we're
going to be turning the power of the hie
toward consumers and people we know for
mcginnises research that in terms of the
greatest predictors of morbidity and
mortality our healthcare system is only
ten percent where eighty-five percent of
where the money spent but it's only ten
percent of the impact more and more care
is migrating out of the hospital out of
primary care doctors offices into the
community and into the home so we are
busy building an opportunity for
patients to look directly into their
current care record to upload their own
information be it biometrics that
they're wearing an embedded chip to
manage their blood pressure or their
measure their glucose or their Fitbit or
whatever device they're wearing we know
that when we go to appleoosa events of
the inventors get up and say we have the
coolest apps and sliced bread and the
greatest thing about it we're going to
be able to send your data directly to
your doctors we know the doctors in the
audience are going you know I can't take
in data from every device we can take in
data we can organize it and we can use
direct to alert physicians when
something is going on in the home that
they need to know about we're on if they
act upon that then they can prevent an
admission they can prevent you know
patient congestive heart failure picks
up seven pounds in two days we'll alert
your care manager that patient will be
home with their family on friday night
and not drowning in their own fluids and
nad so I think it's that idea of
beginning to look at the quantified self
mobile health and how hie s will begin
to integrate that information into that
record so it is all one comprehensive
record problem with a lot of mobile
health right now is it definitely
collects your data and it sends it up to
your mobile health platform not
integrated with anything else so I think
it's that
the idea that we will use direct in the
future because while I may want my 70
year old mother to use the current care
platform my guess is that she won't be
using that I want a proxy message to
come to me and so I will want an alert
from our hospitals that tell me your mom
just got admitted to a needy because my
mom lives in Colorado and I live in
massachusetts in rhode island so i'm
going to want an alert so it sounds like
any physicians out there watching this
this interview and worried about meeting
the VD t requirements of meaningful use
stage 2 should just pack their bags and
move to Rhode Island you're going to do
it for we'd love it because with our
portal we do have the view download and
transmit capability and so we're we give
the ability for someone to get their
complete longitudinal record and current
care in a PDF form they can put it on a
USB Drive they can email it to their
daughter you know whatever well thank
you so much life I appreciate your
allowing us to come up today talk to you
and some of your stay out Jerry Fletcher
thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
