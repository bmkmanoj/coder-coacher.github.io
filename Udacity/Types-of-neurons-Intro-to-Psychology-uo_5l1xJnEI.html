information from the outside world
through our five senses and making sense
of it so that we can respond
appropriately we're able to do this
because of three types of neurons first
we have sensory neurons sensory neurons
receive information from sense organs
for example the eyes the tongue or the
skin everything that we can see touch
taste or feel is because of our sensory
neurons so the sensory neurons send
sensory information to our brain and
spinal cord take this for example
when I saw Sputnik the century' neurons
and my eyes were firing when I was
petting him the centry neurons and my
skin were firing because I could feel
how soft he was the sensory neurons send
the message to the brain where the brain
processes it the motor neurons carry
commands from our brain to our muscles
to allow us to act appropriately so my
motor neurons allowed me to bend down
and pet Sputnik finally we have the
inter neurons the inner neurons connect
neurons to other neurons some
interneurons connect sensory neurons to
motor neurons while some inner neurons
connect neurons in the brain inner
neurons outnumber our sensory and our
motor neurons ten to one so that's right
sensory neurons are responsible for all
the incoming information that goes to
our brain our brain interprets it and
our motor neurons allow us to carry out
appropriate behaviors our inter neurons
connect from motor neurons to sensory
neurons and also neurons to parts of the
brain think Susan you want to give them
a quiz on this yes let's quiz</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
