these to work is continuous integration
which means integrating and testing
every few hours or a day at most because
we don't want problems to pile up and to
be discovered too late when there are
too many of them to fix so what goes on
here is a cycle and the cycle starts
with the developers programming as soon
as the developers are done modifying the
code and they have a stable version they
will run their local tests if the local
tests fail the developers will go back
to programming to fix their code and
possibly add new code as needed and this
cycle mini cycle will continue until all
the local tests pass at that point the
developers can integrate their code with
the code of other developers they can
run tests for the integrated system and
when they run these tests again there
are two possibilities the test might
fail and if the test fails you broke it
and therefore you have to fix it so
developers will have to go back and
modify the system and again going
through the cycle of running the local
tests integrating and running the system
tests conversely if all the system tests
pass then at that point the code is good
to go and it's integrated into the
system and it will be the problem of
some other developers is something
breaks because at the time when you
integrated your code the code was
compiling running and passing the tests
successfully so again if we do this
every few hours or every day we can find
problems very early and we can avoid the
situations in which we have many
different changes coming from many
different developers and a integration
nightmare as a result</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
