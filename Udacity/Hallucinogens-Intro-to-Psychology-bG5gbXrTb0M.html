discuss are the hallucinogens or
psychedelics these drugs can radically
distort the way a person perceives in
addition it can change the way they
think as well as the way they feel
sometimes when people take these
substances they can experience great
fear or anxiety but in some cases they
say that it changes the way they view
the world in addition we see that people
can experience synesthesia and this is a
crossing over of the senses for example
a person may hear colors or taste sounds
in addition LSD can bring back long-lost
memories and some people report a dying
of the ego while taking this drug now
it's no doubt that some people have
experienced troublesome or even a
frightening experiences from taking
hallucinogenic substances and there's
some research to support the idea that
one of these agents can act as an
epigenetic agent and turn on the gene
that codes for mental illnesses such as
schizophrenia
therefore some ager caution for some
people using hallucinogenic substances
now Alice D has effect at the serotonin
receptor and we see that psilocybin or
magic mushrooms also affect the
serotonin receptor system however not to
the same degree as LSD psilocybin can
produce changes in perception and
cognition as well in fact some people
have said that LSD demands introspection
whereas psilocybin invites it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
