sensitivity analysis is to do it one at
a time one factor at a time that is for
instance there is an uncertainty
concerning the initial data actually we
may start here or we may start there and
our knowledge as to where precisely we
start may be limited there is an
uncertainty concerning the initial data
or we may not be able to precisely
control the start of the ramp if we
start little early the total number of
fish will be lower as if we start a
little late so as we change the single
factors sometimes the result goes up as
we change a single factor for instances
in this case with the initial value and
sometimes as we look at the upper limit
of one of the factors the result may go
down and it may go up as we look at the
lower limit like in this case for the
time at which the ramp starts we can
apply this to all factors that influence
the result and check the degree by which
they influence the result we're just
using the base value and then for every
factor changing that factor to its upper
limit and then to its lower limit that's
a little lazy at times this can be too
lazy
most often the other possible values of
that factor will lead to sensible curves
in that range but it may happen that
sometimes you get very weird results for
values in-between nonetheless and the
upcoming program we're looking at the
outermost values this code makes heavy
use of dictionaries a special feature of
the Python language a dictionary
associates keys and values so I can ask
for the string initial underscore value
and get 2 times 10 to the e5 I can ask
for the string maximum underscore growth
underscore rate and retrieve the value
or 0.5 this is a nice trick to have all
factors in one place because we need to
change them one at a time these are the
base values and here we specify the
uncertainties so what we're saying here
is that we know that the initial value
of the amount of fish is between two
times ten
the five minus five times 10 to the 4
tones and 2 times 10 to the 5 plus 5
times 10 to the 4 tones and so on and so
on this dictionary is simply to make
things colorful the different factors
will get different colors as well and
the diagram if you look at the code that
we provide you'll see more details about
dictionaries in there in other
programming languages you may find
dictionaries too or you may have to look
for associative arrays or for maps or
for hash tables from the information
provided in the code you should be able
to return the key of the most critical
parameter in this variable</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
