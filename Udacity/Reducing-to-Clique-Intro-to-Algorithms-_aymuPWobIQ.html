imagine we start off with some graph H a
little bit of a mess there's lots of
edges in here but we're going to do is
convert this to a new graph G which is
the complement of H and so every place
in H where there is an edge we leave the
edge out and every place where there's
not an edge we add an edge so for
example this node is not connected to
this one or this one so in the
compliment graph we connect it to that
one in that one this node is connected
to three on the top and one on the
bottom so we connect it to this one on
the top and these two on the bottom this
one on the top and these two on the
bottom right so we've carefully
constructed this that's complement graph
G and the thing that you need to realize
now is that G this new graph which was
the complement of H has an S cleek if
and only if H has an S independent set
in fact it's the same set of nodes so
here's our for clique for example this
is similar to the graph that we looked
at before this is our for clique in G
and if we look that corresponds exactly
to a for independent set in H right
because if it has all the pairwise edges
in G then it has to fail to have all
those pairwise that there's an H so
that's how we can use a solution to the
clique problem to solve the independent
set problem now in this particular
example well it illustrates a general
idea which is we take instances of one
problem and we transform them into
instances of another in this case the
transformation is really very
straightforward maybe it wasn't obvious
to you at first now that I put it out is
probably pretty straightforward some of
these these reductions actually can be
much more involved this one actually is
also really easily reversed right so if
we have an algorithm for independent set
we could use that to solve the clique
problem the same way invert the graph
right compliment the graph look for the
independent set and that tells us what
the clique is in the original graph but
sometimes that again the connection is
not always so straightforward</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
