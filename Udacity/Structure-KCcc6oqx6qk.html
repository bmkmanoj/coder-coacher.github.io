change a bit from semester to semester
after all we hope to learn and improve
the course over time but there's an
overarching structure that we anticipate
staying fairly consistent you'll start
the course by really getting into an
intense phase of study in the field that
you're most interested in with in
educational technology you'll answer
some reflective questions you'll go out
and find your own resources and you
really develop a mastery of that topic
at the end of that stage you'll be asked
to demonstrate that mastery with a
custom question written just for you to
answer to demonstrate that you can
really think in this field you can
contribute to this community then it's
time to propose your project you'll work
with your mentor to scope out your plan
for the rest of the semester and decide
how you're going to bring your idea to
life at this point you might also decide
to work in a group and tackle a big
problem as a team instead of small
problems as individuals then it's time
to work on your project and you'll spend
the rest of the semester working on it
and delivering weekly reports on how
you're progressing you'll talk to your
mentor a lot during this phase to get
their constant feedback and evaluate how
the project is coming together and then
at the end of the semester you'll
deliver the project a paper and a
presentation so that you can share your
ideas both with your classmates and
potentially with a broader field of
educational technology the goal is that
your project won't end there we hope
that this is just a jumping off point
for something that you'll continue to
work on going forward</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
