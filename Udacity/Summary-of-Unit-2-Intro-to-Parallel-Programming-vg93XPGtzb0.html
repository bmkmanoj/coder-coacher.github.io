the things that we've learned we've
learned about parallel communication
patterns going beyond the simple map
operation that you saw in unit 1 to
encompass other important communication
patterns like gather scatter stencil and
transpose we've learned more about the
GPU programming model and the underlying
hardware such as how thread blocks run
on streaming multi processors or SMS and
what assumptions you can make about
ordering and how threads and thread
blocks can synchronize to safely share
data and memory we've learned about that
GPU memory model topics like local and
global and shared memory and how atomic
operations can simplify memory rights by
concurrent threads finally we got a
quick preview of strategies for
efficient GPU programming the first
principle is to minimize the time spent
on memory accesses by doing things like
coalescing global memory access we saw
that the extremely fast global memory on
the GPU operates best when adjacent
threads access contiguous chunks of
global memory and this is called a
coalesced memory access we also learned
to move frequently accessed data to
faster memory so for example promoting
data to shared memory and we learned
that atomic memory operations have a
cost but they're great and they're
useful and you shouldn't necessarily
freak out about the constant often the
cost is negligible but it's something to
be aware of along the same lines we
learned about avoiding thread divergence
that comes with branches and loops and
once again thread divergence comes at a
cost you should be aware of that but it
isn't necessarily something that you
should be freaked out about we're going
to revisit these topics and talk much
more about optimizing GPU programs in
unit 5 so that's it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
