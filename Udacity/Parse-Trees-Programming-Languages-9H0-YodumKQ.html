to tell if a string is valid however
it's going to turn out that that's not
enough
remember those upside-down parse trees
we talked about earlier we really want
those as well for our HTML and
JavaScript programs in order to
interpret them to get at their meaning
correctly so here I've written a pretty
standard arithmetic expression grammar
an expression can be a number or an
expression plus an expression or an
expression minus expression or maybe a
negated expression like negative 3 and
we'll want to build up parse trees for
this now this time I've written the
tokens as plus and minus not instead of
the symbols plus or minus that's our
choice we can do it either way we want
and the particular format I'm going to
pick for our abstract syntax tree is
nested tuples or nested lists in Python
so if we end up using this rule
expression goes to number we're just
going to return the tuple number 5 if
the input was 5 similarly if the input
is something like not 5 we'll end up
returning not of the number 5 note the
nesting so let's say I call this number
number 1 we really want to return this
tuple number in quotes just as a string
so we know what it is followed by the
value of the token if this was thing
number two in our reduction rule not
expression I'd really want this to be
filled with a 2 if over here this was a
3 I would want to return bin op that
stands for a binary operator binary just
meaning two things so things like plus
minus times and divide those are
arithmetic operations that take two
arguments one on the left and one on the
right we call those binary operators as
a class just to save space but whatever
this third expression was that's what
I'd want this sub tree this sub part of
my tuple to be so just as we've seen
before how we can encode token rules in
Python and do some processing like
chopping off the quotes after we've
specified how the token works using
regular expressions it's going to turn
out that there's a same there's a
similar way for us to do that for
grammar rules in Python now let me
explain a little bit about what's going
on this format is totally arbitrary but
it's going to be very easy for us to you
for assignments and to test your
knowledge for tokens we used a t
underscore to mean I'm defining a rule
for a token for parsing rules we're
gonna use a P underscore to define the
name of a parsing rule and then here
just to help us out we're gonna write
down what the left-hand side of the rule
is this is how you parse an expression
when that expression is a number and
just as our token rules were in some
sense under the hood functions of this
object T our parsing rules are under the
hood functions of this object P and this
is the parse tree or more accurately a
number of parse trees here's our rule
written out and this is very similar to
exp arrow number except that there's no
great way to write the arrow so instead
we'll just write a colon by convention
but you should view this as the arrow so
this is expression can be rewritten as
number and we just put it in quotes like
a string and then down here we have to
tell Python or tell our parsing library
how to build up the abstract syntax tree
p0 is our returned parse tree the
numbering here is every one of these
elements of our grammar rule except the
colon gets a number so the expression on
the left is 0 this number over here is 1
so the parse tree I want associated with
this expression when we're all done is a
tuple that I make by combining the word
number with the value of this actual
token let me show you another one of
these and then it'll be a little clearer
so here once again I start with a P
under score we're going to do that for
all of our parsing rules here's what I'm
telling you how to parse I'm telling you
how to parse an expression there might
be multiple different ways to parse an
expression it could be a number could be
an odd expression so we use another
underscore and be a little more specific
and then down here I've written out my
grammar rule in almost English and again
this colon is like the arrow that we
would normally draw and then below that
I have written out how to construct the
final abstract syntax tree this
expression is number 0 this knot is
number 1 this expression is number 2 so
we want our parse tree for number 0 to
be the tuple I make by putting the word
knot so that I know what it is
in front of the parse tree for number
two if we were to see the input not five
executing these two rules in the right
order this one first and then that one
would give us this tree not number five
and note the nesting I could
alternatively draw it as this is just a
Python way of encoding this visual
representation</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
