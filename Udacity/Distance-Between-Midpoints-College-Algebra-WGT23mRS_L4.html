distances a lot we might as well find
the length of each side of this new
black quadrilateral this time however
were just going to use these coordinates
of the points that we know so what did
we use before well we use the distance
between the x coordinates in the
distance between the y coordinates
squared each of those distances added
them together and then found the
positive square root of that quantity
interesting so you can formalize this
process for any two points where one of
the points has the coordinates that I'll
call x1 y1 and the other point has
coordinates x2 and y2 I want to use
these subscripts here because that lets
me still show that these two coordinates
are in fact x coordinates and these ones
are y coordinates but that they belong
to different points now that we have
this handy dandy formula for the
distance between any two points we can
calculate distances just knowing
coordinates that means we don't need to
rely on our picture anymore although of
course it will be helpful in future to
go back and reference it we know that we
can use this formula to calculate the
distance between any two points so let's
try it for each of the points that
creates the outline of our black
quadrilateral on the visual that I've
now conveniently taken away for you the
notation here that we're using is
similar to what we did before MN for
example is the distance between m and n
2 points on our list you can consider
this just two letters that form a single
variable so NP is the distance between N
and P P Q is visiting P and Q and so on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
