who's a production strategist here at
Udacity she deals a lot with producing
material for our line courses I just
can't talk to us a little bit about
creating online content so thank you so
much for talking to us today welcome so
the first thing I wanted to ask is any
of our students who are familiar with
other platforms may have noticed that
the production values that Udacity tend
to be very high I don't mean that solely
as a compliment because when you produce
content more on budget it's easier to
make it available to a large number of
people and when you have a high cost
associated with it you kind of creates a
barrier so why do we invest so much into
our course production process so I
really look at it as a long term
investment and you wouldn't put this
much time and money in a class we're
just gonna release 250 people so we're
seeing we want to see this through and
see students learn from these classes
for years you know with edits to update
them but another thing we've really done
is we're investing the student
experience not just the course itself so
yes we could give our highly qualified
instructors a camera and they can just
stand in front of a blank screen and
talk but we add a lot to it so that the
students can have the best experience so
you know it takes a lot to have all the
different quizzes or just making it a
little bit fun like when we were talking
about material design and filming with
Porsches like you just add some stuff
and it makes a better student experience
so it's investing in your student not
just the course it sounds like we're
kind of taking that opportunity knowing
that instead of just this being
presented 75 students a semester it's
being presented to thousands or tens of
thousands or hundreds and thousands of
students to really increase what we do
and do it maybe we'd like to always do
but we just don't have the resources to
do it initially and it's one of the
things we tell our professors when we're
getting started with our courses is this
is the opportunity to do what you've
always dreamed of doing at this course
because you probably can't get the
funding to do it when you're teaching it
to 75 students once a year but if you're
teaching it to 300 students three times
a year you can do a lot more so in your
position you deal with a lot of people
who've never taught online before many
of them are experienced teachers in
person who are just making the
transition to the internet others our
subject matter experts who have no
teaching experience and are just experts
in some domain that we're interested in
uh so let me ask you first when you're
dealing with a teacher professor who has
an abundance of in-person
experience but it's never taught online
what are some of the unique issues you
wrestle with and trying to transition
them to teaching in this online
environment um there are a lot of things
one thing that you really have to
address early on is the nerves that come
with teaching online but a lot of people
don't really want to talk about but when
you teach in a classroom 230 people if
you kind of mess up explaining something
oh well shoot your students in email but
when you were recording that it
broadcasting that to potentially a
hundred thousand students it's a little
more terrifying and another thing I see
really often is in with the more
experienced instructors is that they
start to teach for their peers and not
for their students because they they
have to look good for their peers and
people that they're gonna see it
conferences and that can get a little
bit dangerous but one of from a
student's perspective but one of I think
the best things that come after they
come out of that is that the teachers
the professor's will validate their
material even more than they would just
standing in front of 35 people because
they know it's going to be out there
forever they know their peers are going
to be reviewing this too and they they
take more pride in that and I think so
those nerves can kind of play in our
favor but also against us when we start
to lose the student experience in that
so when they try to teach to high level
and so when we're dealing with that
issue and we really want to make
professors remember the student
experience and not just focus on
teaching for their peers what are some
of the things that they can do in this
environment that they can't do in the
regular classroom that we need to make
them aware of I mean that's a great
topic because when you give the teach
online the sky's the limit you have so
many options and it's really important
that you think about when developing
class it you think about okay what are
the good teaching tools or examples that
I've used in class strictly because I'm
constrained within four walls and how
can we expand on that there the sky's
the limit when you're teach a line you
can do a million different things and
use really cool teaching examples that
you could never use in a classroom one
of my favorite examples is when I got to
teach with sea lions and our teaching
about classical and operant conditioning
we've got to go to a laboratory season
Lyons and teach the students that way
and they could see how the sea lions
we're learning husbandry skills it was
really awesome and I could never bring a
sea lion into a university classroom but
I've asked they won't let me but so you
can really stretch the box that way and
it's really important for instructors
who have taught the same class for every
semester for the last ten years and they
use the same syllabus to kind of just
shred that and I'd like to tell our
instructors that don't just think
outside of the box there is no box the
sky the world is your oyster when it
comes to teaching online so really just
getting that creativity out of them when
they're so accustomed to doing the same
thing over and over again could be
challenging but it's endlessly important
for a student experience yeah I imagined
it was many of our professors who've
been teaching for so long they're very
good at the way they teach right now but
I think I've encountered some at least
that I think have forgotten that certain
constraints that they have and started
as constraints that now they're just
kind of part of the fabric of the course
it's something like I have the topics
broken up in a certain way well you only
have the topics broken up like that
because you've been forced to teach hour
and a half lectures all you know for the
past 20 years now you can have a fifteen
minute lecture followed by it an
hour-long one so you have a lot of
flexibility there but what about for
those incoming instructors who have no
teaching experience whatsoever their
subject matter experts at Google or
Facebook or something and they don't
know what it's like to teach at all but
they're experts in their field how do we
help them get accustomed to this so one
thing that's great about the subject
matter experts is they've never started
within that box so they are really good
with the creativity and just expanding
on different ideas and giving the
practical application of what they're
teaching one of the things that we have
to remind them to do is anticipate
students questions and they don't have
experience with students in a classroom
raising their hand saying wait I don't
understand that point so as course
developers we try to highlight different
areas and you see expert blind-spot
a lot with subject matter experts when
you don't as much with professors
because their use of students saying
like then enough that doesn't make sense
so teaching them about expert blind-spot
saying okay you're using jargon there
that your intro students are not going
to understand and they're in
environments where they don't have to
think
that kind of stuff which is great for
them but it's important for the students
that they don't do that anymore when
they're teaching so Lauren is an expert
at producing online content and as a
result she may be using jargon that some
of you aren't familiar with so mark can
you tell our students what um expert
blind-spot is shame on me well so expert
blind-spot is when you have an expert in
a field and they use jargon or explain
the topic and forget that some people
might not know the foundation that the
expert has so you have to take yourself
back a few steps and figure out what it
is that you just assume people know and
what it is people actually do know so
it's a so we try to get how people lose
their expert Brian spot by not having an
assumption of the knowledge that the
student has coming in we actually need
to go in and explore what their base
knowledge is I have a very fond fond
memories of my freshman calculus class
being taught by a Nobel Prize nominated
physicist who had no idea what it was
like to not know how to do a derivative
and so yeah I think that's yeah very
important to me wrestle with in because
we deal with so many subject matter
experts here at Udacity it's even more
pertinent because they have no teaching
experience all they know is their field
yeah I think you're right it's also a
great chance to have that kind of blank
slate to work with someone who hasn't
developed in the ad habits or hasn't
really incorporated those constraints of
the classroom into their outlook on
teaching exactly so in this class we
might have many people who will either
produce online content for this class or
might go into teaching online in the
future in fact that's one of the project
ideas for this class is to actually film
a mini course for some topic you're
interested in so for those who might
want to do that for this class or in the
future what advice would you give them
on getting started with online teaching
um I would say to really reflect on your
past teachers and pick and choose what
things that they would do that you
really really liked and really dissect
that were they good teachers because of
the context they were teaching in so
were they great in a classroom or do you
think what they were doing would
translate really well to online and how
can you expand on that
um just shred every syllabus you've ever
seen and really start from scratch do
they will think way outside the box that
there just is no more box and be
creative start out with the most
outlandish idea
and then reel it in based on your
production constraints that way you know
you at least have a fun class at the end
another thing is to be really honest
consumer you know how long is it and
when you're watching this video until
you want to speed me up first skip to
the next video and then try to reflect
on that and make a class that you would
actually want to watch sometimes sitting
through you know a 20 minute screencast
or headshot is not how you want to do it
most students would just fast forward or
be done with it
so reflect on that and think about the
content you're making and make sure that
you're picking the right medium some
things are just better if people read
them if you can create a PDF that they
should reflect on then come back to
video or a discussion forum I don't know
if you'll have that or not but look at
your content and then pick the best
medium to teach that teach that content
by so is it video is it a screencast of
something is it a reading node which we
call it reading node but I guess in your
case you'd probably be creating like a
PDF but something like that I think the
most important thing is being the honest
student think about things from a
student's perspective yeah I know that
we've probably given you some examples
of some courses out there that we
consider to be high quality we've not
given you any examples of courses that
we don't consider to be high quality
because we don't want that attached to
us but feel free to ask your fellow
classmates on the forums for examples of
online courses they've taken that were
not good and they might recommend some
courses from other platforms they might
recommend some Udacity courses they
might recommend some Georgia Tech
courses but I'll give you something to
actually learn from and see not only
what to do but what not to do so thank
you so much Laura for Thomson today and
thank you all for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
