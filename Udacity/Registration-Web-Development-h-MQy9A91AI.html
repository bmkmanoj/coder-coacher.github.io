are going to be adding user accounts and
there's going to be three parts to this
first part is going to be registration
with a valid cookie let's take a look at
how this my working solution online and
show you what I'm expecting all right so
here we are in my form it's at slash
signup and this is the same form we used
in unit 2 and it has the same validation
so if I type in some junk or forget to
validate my passwords I get an error
message if I were to type invalid data
and hit submit it takes me to a welcome
page notice this time there's no user in
the Welcome that's because it's set a
cookie um so what that did is it
registered my user I did the whole
password hashing hashing salting thing
it's hard for us to test that but what
we can test is that after we log in the
page we get redirected to should have
the username in it and we should have a
cookie
I've extolled this install this edit
this cookie extension in Chrome which is
really handy for this sort of thing to
let me view a cookie and we can see we
have a cookie named user ID and its
value is 2001 pipe and then a hash which
should look familiar from this lesson
and if I were to change this to a
different user ID and then reload this
welcome page it would redirect me to the
signup page because the cookie is no
longer valid that is the first part of
this homework implement the signup page
have a form that still checks for errors
like unit 2 and then if the user
registers it redirects you to the
Welcome page if the user already exists
it should give an error that says that
user already exists okay when you're
done with that submit the URL of that
behavior here and we will check it okay
good luck will include of course more
detailed description in the in the in
the text description of this homework so
all of those form values and that sort
of the form names and stuff that we'll
be testing will be clear ok good luck</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
