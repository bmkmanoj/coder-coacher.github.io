cash updates say we have this problem
where multiple people submit posts to
ASCII Chan at the same time or submit to
your blog at the exact same time you
know let's say they hit multiple app
servers or different app servers they
both write to the database at the same
time and then they both update the cache
at the same time overwriting each other
this can happen this is a type of race
condition where you know two updates
come in at the same time and we don't
know what order to handle them in and
they both squat them basically one
tramples the other if we were to draw
this in a picture it looks something
like this say we've got two app servers
here's an example of the problem and
we've got our database and we've got our
cache and say we've got elements in our
database we're going to call them 1 &amp;amp; 2
and these app servers are both going to
get requests from the user - to submit a
new entry into our database you know a
new piece of art for ASCII Chan and this
happens at the same time so this guy may
submit element 3 and this guy may submit
element 4 so our database is you know in
sync because databases enforce these
constraints you know you can insert as
many things as you want at the same time
the database will order it all for you
but here's the problem let's start with
version 1 of this problem which is each
of these app servers is manipulating the
cache directly so this guy inserts
element 3 and so he writes to the cache
and he says the database looks like this
and just as he does this this app server
finishes inserting item 4 into the
database and he's not communicating with
this app he over writes the cache to
instead look like this 1 to 4 because
this app server remember we're not doing
another query from the database we're
just manipulating cache directly this
app server squashed the other observers
update that's that's a problem now let's
look at another way this problem can
happen say we were using the the first
approach we talked about where we when
we write to the database we immediately
do a read from the database and update
our cache that way we can still have
this problem now first this app server
inserts element 3 into the database and
then it says ok you know let's let's
rerun the query so we can so we can
update the cache but at the same time
this other app server inserts element 4
into the database and it also wants to
rerun the query so
each of these you know has a view of the
database this first app server says
thinks it's one two three and this other
guy thinks it's one two three four now
there's no guarantee you know this first
app server will write to the cache
before this one because things can
happen out of order your app server can
have a slight delay you know there can
be a network glitch there's gonna be any
number of reasons why this app server
might run you know might have a little
hiccup and this guy writes you know or
this guy gets the right to the cache
first one two three four and this other
guy comes and tramples on top of them so
there are a handful of ways where these
app servers can you know overwrite each
other and if we if we were redirecting
the user to our front page to do the
cache update that way the the odds of
this happening is even more likely
because it's not gonna happen it's quite
so fast we gotta go all the way to the
user and back before we update our cache
so that's the problem you know multiple
app servers overriding each other in the
cache because the cache doesn't have any
transactions it doesn't have any of the
fancy stuff that the database has you
know database we just say insert this
element but on the cache we say the list
of elements is this so we can't just
insert at the front of it let me
introduce one solution to this problem</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
