through the Udacity site itself I'm
going to walk you through an example
from the advanced operating systems
course as you can see in this project
questions are being asked directly in
this IDE I can submit my answers by
typing them in directly here then I
click the submit button to send it
through the site I will get some
feedback to let me know that my
submission was accepted and to note that
my grade will be assigned by human being
an important thing to note is that I can
change my answer and resubmit my
submission through the site the class
schedule will tell me up to the minute
of when my submission will be pulled
from the site and graded I can continue
to change my answer and resubmit as many
times as I want up until this deadline
after the deadline I can still change my
answers and submit them through the site
but they won't go anywhere and no one
will be grading them please check with
your TA instructor if you have any
questions about these deadlines</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
