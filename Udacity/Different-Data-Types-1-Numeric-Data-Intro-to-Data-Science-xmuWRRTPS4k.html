encode and represent your data another
thing to consider is the different types
of data that are available most data can
be categorized into three basic types in
fact we've seen all three types of this
data during our walkthrough of the
baseball data without explicitly
referring to them as such the first of
these types is numeric data numeric data
as you might expect is any data where
our data points are exact numbers these
data have meaning as a measurement such
as a baseball players height or weight
or as a count such as the number of hits
or homeruns for a player or how many
players that were on a team
statisticians also might call numerical
data quantitative data numerical data
can be characterized in two discrete or
continuous data discrete data has
distinct values or as continuous data
can assume any value within a range for
example a player's number of homeruns
would be a discrete data set you can
only have discrete whole number values
like 10 25 or 30 for a player cannot for
example hit fourteen point three seven
five homeruns
a player either hits a home run or he
doesn't on the other hand continuous
data our numbers that can fall anywhere
within a range like a player's batting
average which falls between zero and a
thousand so a player could have a
batting average of 0.25 zero
they could also have a batting average
of 357 or 511 and so again just to
hammer this home examples of numeric
data might be a baseball players height
or weight or they're a number of home
runs or a number of hits or a number of
doubles the takeaway here is that this
is data that are numbers and they are
not ordered in time they're just numbers
that we've collected</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
