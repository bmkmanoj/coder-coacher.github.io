like I've learned a lot and I have built
a really cool app and it's on my phone
that's pretty exciting yeah um I guess
all that stuff we learned about other
workflows the approvals the you know
dashboards and charts is it all on the
phone too yeah so everything that we
built today is totally accounted for and
works both in the desktop or mobile apps
so you simultaneously built two apps
today that's really awesome uh I guess
my ask question is where do I go from
here I mean I'm hooked I'm into this I
want to build more stuff I'll show you
so I mean we've only scratched the
surface of stuff that you can do with
point and click tools so you can learn a
little bit more about what else we could
do there uh you could maybe read about
apex and visual for us and you know get
into the programmatic code side of
things okay or you could take the skills
we've learned today and then build your
own app what do you want to do let's do
that I wanna build another app all right
let's do it congratulations you create
in a nap and you went mobile it's pretty
exciting but really it's just the tip of
the iceberg there's so much more you can
do in Salesforce I'm really excited to
see what you're going to do in your
final project are you ready to start</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
