little journey to Stanford and show them
our self-driving car that uses sensors
to sense the environment so let me dive
into the class very much right now
through a last class we talked about
localization we had a robot they lived
in an environment and that it could use
its sensors to determine where in the
environment it is so here you could see
the Google self-driving car using a road
map localizing itself but in addition
what Sounion read are measurements of
other vehicles the car uses lasers and
radars to track other vehicles and today
we're gonna talk about how to find other
cars the reason why we'd like to find
other cars is because we wouldn't want
to run into them so we have to
understand how to interpret sensor data
to make assessments not just where these
other cars are as in the localization
case but also how fast they're moving so
you can drive in a way that avoids
collisions within in the future it's
important not just for cars administer
for pedestrians and for bicyclists and
understanding where are the cars are and
making prediction where they're gonna
move is absolutely essential for safe
driving in the Google car project so in
this class you talk about tracking and
the technique I'd like to teach you is
called a Kalman filter this is an
insanely popular technique for
estimating the state of a system it's
actually very similar to the
probabilistic localization method we
talked in the previous class Monte Carlo
localization their primary differences
are that common filters estimate a
continuous state whereas in Monte Carlo
localization we were forced to chop the
world in the discrete places and as a
result the Kalman filter happens to give
us a unimodal distribution and I'll tell
you in a second what that means res
Monte Carlo was fine with multimodal
distributions both of these techniques
are applicable to over localization and
tracking other vehicles in fact in the
later class you can learn about particle
filters
which I get another way to address the
same problem and indeed they actually
continuous and multimodal but for the
time being that's looking to common
faders and ignore these are the two
families or methods let me start with an
example consider the car down here let's
assume with seasons measurement an
object here here here and here
but the time is T equals zero T equals
one two and three where would you assume
the object would be a tea it's for Shake
one of those three boxes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
