lexical analysis is the process of
breaking up a string into a list of
tokens we're now getting into
syntactical analysis which takes a list
of words and tells you if that list of
words is a valid derivation in the
grammar follows the rules of the formal
grammar is in the language of the
grammar all three of those mean the same
thing just as the process of doing
lexical analysis is sometimes called
lexing the process of doing syntactical
analysis is called sinning no weight
parsing parsing or syntactical analysis
involves breaking down a list of tokens
to see if it's valid in the grammar or
breaking down a list of words to see if
they follow the rules of a language to
make our web browser our interpreter for
HTML and JavaScript we're going to
combine the lexing we've already learned
about with a parsing that we'll be
learning in this unit in the next and
that's going to give us a huge amount of
power for to put this another way
lexing word rules + sentence rules from
parsing is going to give us a scope and
a structure in which to express creative
utterances so it's time to put those two
great tastes together here on the Left I
have a simple expression grammar that
mentions numbers as a terminal and over
here on the right I have our rule in our
lexer for figuring out when a string is
a number it's if it matches this
particular regular expression if I put
the two of these together plus a similar
rule for what it means to write a plus
sign and what it means to write a minus
sign then I can suddenly tell that more
realistic strings like 1 plus 2 our
valid in our language 1 matches our rule
for number + matches our rule 4 + 2
matches our rule for number and then
this whole utterance number plus number
is in the language of our grammar for
expressions so this is good
similarly 33 is a number 44 is a number
- is the minus sign this is great and
over here I've got 7 plus 2 minus 2 or
if you like 7 plus or minus 2
which I here is a magic number so down
here at the bottom I have a slightly
longer derivation that shows off both
the grammar part and also the lexical
analysis part and grammar turns
expression into expression plus
expression lexical analysis turns number
into five or six or some such</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
