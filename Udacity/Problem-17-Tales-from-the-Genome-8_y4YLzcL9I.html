toughest problems we've had but one of
the toughest probability problems we've
had so let's work through this together
one step at a time we have the same
pedigree as before talking about
galactosemia a rare autosomal recessive
disease and we've figured out that the
man up top and the female here are the
only two who are affected and what we
want to know is whether or not this
couple's child is going to be affected
by galactosemia so we're going to have
to figure out the probability that the
people in between here are actually
affected or rather not affected but our
heterozygous carriers and what's the
probability of them passing it on let's
start down here with the sister she's
affected so we know because this is
autosomal recessive she must be minus
minus that means the parents must be
heterozygous it's the only way she could
be affected right and the parents are
unaffected they both had to pass on an
allele all right so they must be that's
the probability of one for each of those
if they mate and produce the female here
there are several options to
heterozygous people come together we can
have plus plus plus minus plus minus or
minus minus but the thing is is we know
she's not affected at all so this
possibility is completely removed from
our equation there only three
possibilities here plus plus plus minus
plus minus two out of the three
possibilities are heterozygous so
there's a two-thirds probability that
she is a carrier or heterozygous now
let's look at the father side of the
pedigree we know that the maternal
grandfather was affected so he's
affected he's minus minus we assume
marrying in from the outside you're plus
plus and so the male can only pass down
and affected allele she's unaffected so
we know she must be heterozygous that's
a probability of one that she's
heterozygous we assume that I'm mating
him from the outside you're homozygous
unaffected the probability of this
heterozygous female passing the affected
allele down would be one half right she
can either pass this allele down or that
alia down and it's one half and now we
have two parents if we assume their
probability half probability of
heterozygous here two-thirds probability
of heterozygous here if you make two
heterozygous individuals together the
probability of them having an affected
offspring is one out of four so that
would be one out of four so we have our
three probabilities I'm going to ignore
where every time we had an instance of
one we're going to take one half
multiply it by two thirds and x 1 for
the twos cancel out and so I get 1 over
3 times 4 which is 12 or 112 would be
the answer to this question as the
probability that this couples child
would have galactosemia and don't be
discouraged if this was difficult this
is a difficult problem but working
through it slowly step by step you get
an idea of how difficult it can be to
work through all these probabilities and
percentages and you also become keenly
aware of these assumptions we're making
along the way about people who made in
from the outside and what the possible
options are of where these alleles come
from</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
