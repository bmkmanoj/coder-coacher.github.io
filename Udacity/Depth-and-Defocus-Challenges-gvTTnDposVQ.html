of computing depth from defocus well
it's extremely hard to discriminate a
scene where basically there is smooth
information or there is blur information
specifically d focus blur and of course
once we figure out if there is the focal
splurt it's hard to actually undo it so
here basically again is example how do
we know this is out of focus again by
looking at it we can kind of see it's
blurry and how do we know what kind of
blur it is remember when we talked about
cameras blurry images can be caused by
variety of reasons this could have been
a blur because the camera shook how do
we know it's actually a blur because of
its out of focus or the focus plane is
in front or behind it another part of it
is how to get rid of blur well there's a
vast amount of literature and image
processing so if somebody gave you an
image like this you can actually run a
algorithm specifically the lucy
richardson algorithm which again has
been known since 1972 74 which would
actually deke involve this image to be
able to generate a sharper or attempt to
create a sharper image of course if you
notice here there is an artifact called
ringing you can see different types of
things across the 5 and the 4 this is an
artifact that will come in because we're
trying to take this information and use
that to sharpen an image and after
certain kinds of sharping effects you'll
actually get artifacts like this partly
the reason is again if you have an
original image that's blurry like this
you really can't completely generate
something out of nothing there's no
information you can't create it one of
the mantras always I are used in
computational photography is what you
see is all you get that basically
reduces the space of which you can do
with an image if you actually have a bad
image there are other ways you can try
to perfect it and will actually talk
about those types of things do</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
