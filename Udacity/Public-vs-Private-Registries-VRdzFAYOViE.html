the application packaged up it's got to
be time to copy down to the server and
run it slow down there cowboy while you
could do that it kind of defeats the
point the whole point of using docker
was to make it easy to distribute your
applications what you propose works for
a small set of machines that won't scale
to say a hundred machines the right
thing to do in this case is to push your
container images to remote repository
and leverage tools like docker to fish
those images from a central place when
we need to run them okay I think I've
heard of those are you talking about
docker hub yes but if I use that Kent
anyone access my containers yes all
images you push to the doctor hub are
public by default but don't worry you
also have the option to make those
images private and limit access to them
you also have the flexibility to share
some images public and others private
this often the case when companies have
open source projects they want to share
with the world but keep their secret
sauce to themselves okay I get it but I
think this is something I need to see in
action</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
