goals they should be flexible able to
support different topologies routing and
forwarding architectures and independent
configurations they should be manageable
in other words they should separate the
policy that a network operator is trying
to specify from the mechanisms of how
those policies are implemented this
should be scalable maximizing the number
of coexisting virtual networks they
should be secure by isolating the
different logical networks from one
another they should be programmable and
they should be heterogeneous in the
sense that they should support different
technologies so virtual networks have
two components nodes and edges the
physical nodes themselves must be
virtualized one possible way
virtualizing a node is a virtual machine
a more lightweight way of virtualizing a
node is using a virtual environment such
as a V server or a jail the hypervisor
or whatever technology is enabling the
virtual environment can effectively
slice the underlying physical hardware
to provide the illusion of multiple
guests nodes or multiple virtual nodes
examples of node virtualization include
virtual machine environments such as Zen
or VMware or what's called os-level
virtualization or virtual environments
such as Linux V servers now in a virtual
network we need to connect these virtual
machines each virtual machine or virtual
environment has its own view of the
network stack and we may want to provide
the appearance that these nodes are
connected to one another over a layer 2
topology even if they are in fact
separated by multiple IP hops one
possible way of doing that is to
encapsulate the ethernet packet as it
leaves the vm on the left in an IP
packet the IP packet can then be
destined for the IP address of the
machine on the right and when the packet
arrives at this machine the host can D
capsulate the packet and pass the
original Ethernet packet to the vm or
the virtual environment that's residing
on that physical note each one of these
physical hosts
in fact host multiple virtual machines
or virtual environments which creates
the need for a virtual switch that
resides on a physical host this virtual
switch provides the function of
networking virtual machines together
over a virtual layer 2 topology the
Linux bridge is an example of a software
switch that can perform this type of
function open V switch is another
example of software that performs this
type of glue function you can see more
