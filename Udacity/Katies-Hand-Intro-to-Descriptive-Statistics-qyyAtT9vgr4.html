where we correlated sleep and memory and
you've learned about surveys where we
ask people questions and you've learned
about experiments which are our best bet
for proving causality for the most part
in this course we're going to focus on
observational studies that's because we
can't exactly do a survey or experiment
online but we do think it's important
for you to know the different kinds of
studies that we use with statistics here
at Udacity we did our own little
observational study which we're going to
share with you so that you can draw your
own conclusions by now you know my hand
pretty well you see it all the time when
I'm writing out the lessons so now
you're gonna use what you know about my
hand to know a little more about me
there's a link at the right called
height and hand length with real data on
hand length and height of the people
here at Udacity let's bring this data up
if we highlight the data and then go up
here to insert chart go to charts and
select scatter and we need to click here
on scatter chart and then click insert
after you click insert a scatter plot
should pop up that visualizes this data
you should see a clear relationship
between height and hand links based on
this scatter plot if I tell you my hand
is six point seven five inches long how
tall do you think I am write your answer
in inches since that's how we measured
hand links just take a guess this
doesn't affect your grade the purpose of
this is for you to use patterns to make
educated guesses</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
