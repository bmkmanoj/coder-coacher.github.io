precedence and associativity over here
on the Left I've written out a grammar
for lists and lists elections in Python
so it's actually kind of cool an
expression can be a list of integers
separated by commas you can have as many
integers as you want and let's imagine
there's some other rule where int goes
to 1 2 3 we have tokens for that you can
take the length of a list or if you're
given a list you can select off all but
the last element so if you had the list
1 2 3 then you just get the list 12 now
I tell you as part of this problem that
Len associates to the right and has low
precedence and selecting off all but the
last element associates to the left and
has high precedence just like we might
have told you before that multiplication
as high precedence and addition has
lower precedence and then the input here
is I want to compute the length of one
to three with the last element selected
off the last element selected off and
then down here I've parenthesized that
input two different ways and what I want
you to do is check the box that
corresponds to what our parse tree looks
like if we were to put this
associativity and precedence declaration
into our parser with this grammar which
one of these worlds would we end up in</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
