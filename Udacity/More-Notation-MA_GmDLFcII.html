the concrete operations we're going to
have variables Q sub 1 Q sub 2 and so on
to correspond to the abstract ones which
were the peas and similarly to
correspond to the abstract state which
was indicated by s we're going to have
the concrete state indicated by T as a
typical concrete state element and
capital T is the set of concrete States
and then the interesting one is that
we're going to introduce a function at
retrieve function here using retr as an
abbreviation for it and it's going to
map from concrete States to abstract
ones that is retrieve on some tea
concrete state t is going to be
corresponding to some abstract state s
and it's always going to be the case
that T goes to a single s however it
might be the case that different teas go
to the same s you kind of expect that
because at the lower level we have more
details and so we can get into more
states but those states are going to map
into a fewer number of abstract states</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
