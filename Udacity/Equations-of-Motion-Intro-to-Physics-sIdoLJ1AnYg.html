geometry is something that was very
popular in the time of Galileo today
it's more common to see equations isn't
that right professor
Virgilia mathematics was geometry you
find for instance the law of freefall
expressed not in a and equation that
we're familiar with but in terms of
ratios this is - this as that is the
fact so let's review what we've learned
about motion we've learned what position
velocity and acceleration are and these
are the keywords we use to describe
motion we've defined them in terms of
each other so for example velocity is
defined in terms of a change in position
we've given units to position velocity
will get therefore acceleration and now
we found something truly incredible a
mathematical relationship between time
and position for an object in freefall
now put yourself in Galileo shoes
imagine being the first person to
realize that nature not only behaves
predictably but in a way that we can
describe using mathematics it's truly a
beautiful thing
and from this Galileo actually inferred
that acceleration is constant and what
Galileo meant by constant acceleration
was that no matter where you were in the
world whether you're in Pisa or Peru if
you drop an object it will fall at a
constant rate the acceleration will be
the same everywhere and for all objects
now to better understand this idea let's
talk about the units of acceleration a
little bit more well the units are
meters per second per second so notice
that these units include both a time
interval that's second and the speed
meters per second this sort of hints at
the definition for constant acceleration
which just means an object gains equal
speed during equal time intervals so if
we drop an object and it starts at rest
and after one second it has a speed of
10 meters per second meaning that it's
gained 10 meters per second of speed in
that first second what will its speed be
after 2 seconds and this can be a subtle
point so don't worry if you don't get it
right on your first try</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
