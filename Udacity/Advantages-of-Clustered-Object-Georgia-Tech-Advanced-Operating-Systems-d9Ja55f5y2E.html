advantages first of all the object
reference is the same on all the nodes
so that's very very important regardless
of which node a particular service is
executing they all have the same object
reference but under the covers you can
have incremental optimization of the
implementation of the object depending
on the usage pattern you can have
different levels of replication of the
same object so it allows for incremental
optimization and you can also have
different implementations of the same
object depending on the usage pattern
and it also allows for the potential for
dynamic adaptations of the
representations the advantage of course
of the replication is that the object
references can access their respective
replicas independently and this means
that you have less locking of shared
data structures let's think about the
process object as a concrete example so
if you think about the process object
it's one per CPU and it is mostly read
only and and therefore page fault
handling can start on all of these
different processors independent of one
another and if they touch different
regions of the address space then the
path taken by the page fault handling
for all these different threads can be
different so what that means is that
page fault handling for instance will
scale in this case using this as a
concrete service with a number of
processes it'll scalar the number of
processes and this is important because
page fault handling is something that is
going to happen often and so you want to
make sure that it scales was a number of
processes on the other hand if we want
to get rid of a region then the
destruction of region may take more time
because the region may have multiple
representations and all the
representations of that particular
region has to be gotten rid of and so
destruction of a region may take more
time but that's okay because you don't
expect recent instructions to happen as
often as handling page faults to service
the ongoing needs of the threat so the
principle again is to make sure the
common case is optimized
common cases page fault handling region
creation regent destruction all of those
things happen more rarely and it is okay
if those functionalities take a little
bit more time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
