ancestry information are you are you
most intrigued by are you most
interested in finding something out
about Ryan I think for me it's just to
see know what different cultures or what
different ethnic groups I spring from
because the Philippines have been
conquered by Spain and they Spain real
bid for 400 years and then the Japanese
invaded for a while and then we were
also part of the United States for a
while and so just finding out what
different ethnic groups what kind of did
what kind of genetics I have in terms of
where does my gene pool come from mmm is
really that's kind of in terms of the
past for me and then sure the
Neanderthal things pretty cool to just
kind of an interesting fact but it's not
gonna it's not gonna change your
identity thing I just like you know any
if I knew anyone who have is like all
what's your percentage of me a cocktail
party conversation yeah does it change
your identity at all if you find this
information out I can go to cookery I
mean let's say you mentioned that you
know your mother is lighter skinned and
maybe is there a European and you know
my background somewhere does that change
anything for how you think about
yourself or your family and how does it
impact what you're most interested in
finding out about I think it changes
what I think about my family
historically in terms of what happened
at the time in the country and where my
ancestors were in order to interact with
people from another continent I don't
think it changes how I think about my
grandmother
or each one of them as individuals it
just helps me build a story as to where
my people came from and that's what I
would be most interested in it's more
like sort of completing a patchwork of
you know your past and yes but I mean I
could make it up but it's I'll be very
happy with that because clearly it's not
something that will change how I live my
life it's more about the curiosity
behind knowing where i came from with
almost with more certainty than my
made-up story in my head so what about
you sterling someone who you know it
doesn't isn't familiar with there's a
specific biological background um i
think for the the deep historical part
the ancestry is morbid curiosity i mean
i can hypothesize you know that i'm
probably from some mash up of european
countries but it'll be interesting to
know like if their specific ones that
more of my genetics the great percentage
of my genetics comes from so that starts
more of a curiosity but obviously the
biological relatives will have a more of
an impact and probably change could
change a few things in my life</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
