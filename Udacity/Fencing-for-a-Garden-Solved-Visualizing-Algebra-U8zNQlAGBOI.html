in length and six feet and width nice
solving if you found these two answers
now we're just getting warmed up so if
you didn't get it that's okay let's see
how we solve first we replace this
variable L with its equivalent
expression 18 minus W that goes inside
parentheses here next we multiply each
term in the parentheses by W so we'll
have 18 w minus W squared again we have
a quadratic equation here since we have
W squared so we want to move all of
these terms to the left hand side so our
W squared will be positive so we'll add
W square root of both sides and we'll
subtract 18w from both sides this gives
us w squared minus 18 w plus 72 on the
left and 0 on the right next we want to
factor this quadratic so we find factors
of 1 x 72 or just 72 that's sum to
negative 18 these two factors are
negative 6 and negative 12 we'll set
each factor equal to 0 so the width can
equal 6 or the width can equal 12 we
know the links should be 12 feet and the
wood should be six feet since the length
is the longer side you'll notice that it
doesn't matter which value that we use
for W the final result will be the same
rectangular garden it will be 12 feet by
6 feet and as always we can quickly
check to make sure these dimensions are
correct if we go all the way around our
garden will have the perimeter which is
12 plus 6 plus 12 plus 6 which equals 36
feet all together this checks since this
is what we expected the perimeter to be
in our original problem for the area we
multiply 12 by six to get 72 feet
squared this also checks which is great
since 72 was the area of our garden
originally</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
