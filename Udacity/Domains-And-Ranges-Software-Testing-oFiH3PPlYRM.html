this issue in a little bit more detail
so if we think about a piece of software
as a mathematical object of course
that's very natural for something like a
square root function but we can do this
for any piece of software if we think of
a piece of software as a mathematical
object what we'll find is the software
has a domain of values and the domain of
values is just a set of possible values
that constitutes the set of inputs that
the software is designed to handle now
correspondingly every piece of software
also has a range this is the set of
possible outputs for the software and so
let's look at what the domain and range
are for the square root function so
earlier we said that we probably would
like to return the positive answer for a
square root and we also said that we're
going to probably not going to be able
to compute the square root of a negative
number and we can account for both of
those facts and the square roots domain
and range by making it a function from
non-negative real-valued numbers to
non-negative real-valued numbers
alternatively if we're implementing some
sort of mathematical software we might
want to define square root for all real
valued numbers in which case the domain
is the full set of real numbers and then
the range is the set of complex numbers
now actual computer code is not going to
be able to deal with a full set of real
numbers most real valued numbers are not
representable on a computer at all so
instead of dealing with the reals we're
going to worry about floating-point
numbers so for example we might want to
make square root of function from
non-negative floating-point numbers to
the set of non-negative floating-point
numbers this isn't really very
convenient what should we do is somebody
call square root with a negative number
so what languages like Python often do
is declare square root over the full
range of floating-point numbers and give
outputs that are the positive ranged
floating-point numbers unioned with a
different behavior which is to throw an
exception and so this bottom domain and
range for floating-point is the
situation we actually get in many real
programming languages so now given the
specification let's get back to software
testing and ask the question should we
test this square root function with
negative inputs so now let's bring the
discussion back to testing and take a
little quiz so the question is given the
specification here where square root
Maps
full set of floating-point numbers onto
either a floating-point number or a math
exception should we test this code with
negative inputs and answers are either
yes we should test it with negative
inputs or no we should not so take a
minute now to mark down your answer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
