original matrix with its rows and
columns flipped along the diagonal there
are two diagonals but the one I mean is
from the upper left to the lower right
it's where we put the scale factors for
example here I'm showing the original
matrix a b c d and so on with column
order what we do to transpose as we
flipped along the diagonal and they're
now in this order the mathematical
notation for this is M superscript T
where T means transpose the other
operation that is commonly done to a
matrix is computing its inverse the
inverse is shown like this a negative 1
in the superscript if you multiply a
matrix by its inverse you get the
identity matrix the inverse of a matrix
essentially undoes the work of that
matrix for example if your matrix moves
an object five units up the inverse
moves at five units down the inverse of
a rotation matrix is one that rotates on
the same axis but back the other
direction the inverse of a scale matrix
scales the object back down let's look
at the inverses of some common transform
matrices for translation we start with
our translation values over here the
inverse is the negation of all those
translation values which makes sense you
move to one direction and then you come
back the other direction for any
rotation matrix it turns out that the
inverse is the transpose so for this one
for example it's a rotation around the
z-axis and you simply transpose these
two elements and you now have the
inverse of the Z rotation for a scale
matrix we divide one by the original
scale factors or to say it more
mathematically we take the
multiplicative inverse of each scale
factor things get more complex when we
combine rotation translation and scale
matrices the inverse of a matrix
representing a complex series of
transforms is usually not obvious I
won't spend the time explaining how to
compute an inverse that's a whole lesson
in linear algebra the good news is that
every graphics library in the known
universe has a matrix inversion routine
of some sort 3gs is no exception the
matrix for class has a get inverse
