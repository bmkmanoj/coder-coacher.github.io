little more simply here's my lawnmower
the weight the normal force and the push
force comes in like this but that's not
how I like to draw my forces I like to
draw them coming from the object not
going into it so I'm going to draw like
this and it has a value of 20 Newtons
I'm going to break that into a parallel
component and a perpendicular one and
I'm going to remember that this angle
here is 60 degrees well I know that this
is my equation for work and Delta X I
know is this 150 meters now I just need
to know F parallel well looking at this
right triangle here i can see f
parallels the adjacent side and carrying
out the math I find f parallels 10
Newtons multiplying this by 150 meters I
get total work of a thousand five
hundred joules if you got this very good
let's go back to our man moving water
along the dike to see exactly what was
going on so in this case the man was
lifting upwards with some force but the
direction of motion was this way
actually let me just extend this arrow
so that we can see this is a right angle
when our vectors are perpendicular in
this way well no component of force will
ever be parallel to Delta X in fact
whenever the force is perpendicular to
the displacement or the Delta X no work
is done one thing we haven't thought
about is what happens when the force is
in the opposite direction of the
displacement</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
