one it's so tempting and actually
technically it's a little bit correct I
encourage you to go to the forums to
talk about why this is a little bit
correct but I think the best answer is
that there is no force because let's say
this we're positive well then it's going
to feel a repulsive force from this
positive guy and an equal attractive
force from the negative since these are
the same size force these are going to
exactly balance out and so no force this
guy were negative same thing except now
the repulsion comes from the negative
force and the attraction comes from the
positive now why did i bring this up
this is just some weird coincidence okay
in this situation this guy didn't feel
any force no it's not a weird
coincidence in fact you almost never
find isolated charges like this in
nature and why not because electricity
is really really really strong it's a
super strong force compared to gravity
man gravity is so weak compared to
electricity and what that means is if
this guy were to exist this lone
negative charge and somewhere off in the
distance there was a lonely positive
charge they would find each other and
they would pair off and it seems like in
our universe there's more or less an
equal amount of positive and negative
charges let's take a look at the human
body for example</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
