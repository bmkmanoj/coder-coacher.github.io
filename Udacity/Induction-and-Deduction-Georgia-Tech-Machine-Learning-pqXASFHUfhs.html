that work and what you end up doing in
supervised learning and function
approximation in general is you make
some fundamental assumptions about the
world right you decide that you have a
well behaved function that is consistent
with the data that you're giving and
with that you're able to generalize and
the fact that is the fundamental problem
in machine learning it is generalization
now what's behind all of this I'm gonna
claim Michael you jump in whatever you
disagree disagree
ah that's re to sink it is bias and in
particular inductive bias inductive bias
so all of machine learning or certainly
supervised learning is about induction
as opposed to deduction
I see induction of course being the
problem of going from examples to a more
general rule right specifics to
generalities by contrast deduction is
would be the opposite it would be going
from a general rule to specific
instances basically like reasoning right
and in fact a lot of AI in the beginning
was about deductive reasoning about the
logic programming those sorts of things
where you have certain rules and you
deduce only those things that follow
immediately from those rules so for
example you'd have something like a
implies B that's a rule in the universe
and then I tell you a so if you know a
implies B is a rule in the universe and
I tell you a then you also know that a
implies B and therefore you can and
infer that B B you have a implies B you
have a that implies B ok that's what we
just said
that's deduction but what we just did
was not deduction before then when I
asked you 1 1 2 4 3 9 4 16 and so on and
so forth right we did induction that was
in - induction is more about to the
sunrise yesterday yes did the sunrise
the day before that yes the sunrise the
day before that I suck in did the
sunrise the day before that yes yes so
the Sun has risen every day is the Sun
gonna rise tomorrow I sure hope so
we all hope so and we all act like it
does because if it doesn't then there
are a whole bunch of other things we
ought to be doing besides sitting in the
studio and having this interview I think
we should warn the plants I don't think
the blades are gonna care they are they
really need Sun I think we all need
something Michael so the idea there is
induction is crucial and
inductive biases crucial we'll talk
about all this in the course okay but
that's kind of a fundamental notion
behind supervised learning and machine
learning in general I give you that all
right so we're on the same thing
so that's supervised learning supervised
learning you can talk about any high
muckety-muck ways but at the end of the
day it's function approximation it's
figuring out how to take a bunch of
training examples coming up with some
function that generalizes beyond the
data that you see so why would you call
it function induction then because
someone said supervised learning first
well you said supervised learning is
function approximation and I want to say
why don't you say supervised learning is
function induction as opposed to
function approximation yeah okay
it's a approximate function induction or
induction of approximate of approximate
function something like that you don't
want to induce an approximate function
you want to induce the actual function
yeah but sometimes you can yeah because
sometimes you think it's quadratic but
it's not I have that as a plaque on my
wall
you do know yeah it takes okay so that's
supervised learning</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
