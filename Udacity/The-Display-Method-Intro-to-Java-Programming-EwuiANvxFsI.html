the display method it's supposed to
display a choice question in this format
first the text of the question then all
of the choices and we put a one two
three four in front of each of the
choices in case the poor test taker is
too frazzled to figure out the numbers
themselves it's easy enough to do this
part all we have to do is loop through
the choices and print them with the
number in front of them and since this
is nothing to do with learning about
inheritance I'm just going to give you
this code it's right here
so we print the number of the ith oice
and the i's item actually not quite
because in Java the choices have indexes
zero one two and three and we choose the
more traditional one two three four
which accounts for the I plus one over
here the hard part is to display the
text of the question again the question
text is in the superclass object and we
can't get at it directly let's have a
look at the superclass here is the
question text do we have any method that
lets us read it
none of these huh but we could call
display and then it would print it
that's just what we need
let's do it here I'll call display that
should just play the text and then here
I'm displaying these choices I'll run
the demo ooh something very bad happened
I got a stack overflow error now that's
technical lingo for having a method that
keeps calling itself
why itself ah see the method is called
display and here it calls itself that's
a problem I didn't want to call my own
method I wanted to call the display
method of the question class so my
difficulty is that I have two methods
called display in the superclass and in
the subclass and they have the same name
that's exactly what always happens when
you override a method now there's a
special syntax for invoking the
superclass method and it looks like that
you simply say super dot display go
ahead and give that a try and fix up the
display method</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
