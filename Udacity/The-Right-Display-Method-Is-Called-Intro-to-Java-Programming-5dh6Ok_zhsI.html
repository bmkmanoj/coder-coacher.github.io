method gets called in the present
question method the method has a
parameter whose type is question so here
is the parameter variable it contains an
object reference which points to an
object an object of what type well you'd
think it's question because that I've
draws the type of Q but not so fast the
type of Q the variable is indeed
question the type of the object is
really not known it could be any subtype
of question now the good thing is then
when the program runs it does the right
thing edie runtime it's determined what
the exact type of this object is and its
display method is called that might be
questioned about display choice question
display or the display method of some
other class that also extends the
question class this is a very useful
feature because it allows us to write
generic code such as present question
that works with questions of any type
actually this diagram should be familiar
to you you've seen the same diagram when
we talked about interfaces and there is
a name for the fact that the correct
version of a method gets selected at
runtime remember what that call was it
object-oriented programming
encapsulation inheritance or
polymorphism</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
