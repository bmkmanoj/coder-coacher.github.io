realize that pad lab is Nash equilibrium
but we can go further than that or
farther than that further we can go
further than that and show that in fact
Pavlov is sub game perfect so unlike tit
for tat it's actually sub game perfect
so let's let's take a look at how we
could convince ourselves of that so I
think the important thing to see is that
by feeding these two Pavlov machines
different sequences we can get into any
of these four different combinations of
states they're both in the cooperation
state they're both in the both in the
defect state once cooperate ones defect
wants to affect one's cooperate and so
is it the case that no matter which
state those are in that the average
reward is going to be mutual cooperation
so let's check so if they're both
cooperating and then we continue with
these Pavlov machines then they will
mutually cooperate so yes all right if
we're in defect effect and what's going
to happen well then they both agrees
with the cooperate so they're going to
move to cooperate and then they'll stay
there forever so then that's that'll be
mutual cooperation awesome what if one's
in cooperate and one's a defect then
they disagree right and they move to the
other state more specifically what oh I
don't know remember I'm trying to keep
track of who's who so if I cooperate and
you defect then let's see the guy who
cooperates moves to defect and the guy
who defects moves to defect so you and
now you agree and so you're going to
cooperate boom so when we're in the
cooperate defect state then on the first
move let's say you just did the right
hand Pavlov just defected so that causes
this transition and this guy just
cooperated which causes this interest
and so that we've gone to defect effect
road which means that we're going to
average cooperation because then so
we're going to be it stuck in the long
run and the same thing works through
here boom that's actually very cool and
kind of counterintuitive yeah it's
really neat so it's sort of no matter
what weird sequence we've been fed we
managed to resynchronize and then return
to a mutually cooperative state so I
have a question for you go for it so
presumably this is really cool like math
matically because now we should all do
we should all be Pavlovian like we're
all Keynesian and then we just kind of
move forward from there do people do
this I I don't know the answer to that
question I mean other than men on a
basketball court sure you can always
return to that though I i'm not sure i'm
aware of any analyses of men on a
basketball court and whether or not you
know people have analyzed that hmm but
how about this if i find out i will post
something on the instructor comments
okay that's injuries well so pavlovas
sub game perfect that's awesome so
remind me again why I care did something
sub game perfect ah because it means
that so let's say that you actually so
I'm being this left Pavlov and you'd
effect on me and you're like yeah I'm
gonna defect on you because I just want
to take advantage of you because you're
gonna you're going to forgive me and I
will have gotten this extra bonus for
that and what it turns out is that know
if we do Pavlov against Pavlov we're
going to fall into mutual cooperation no
matter what so this defection that I do
this this threat this punishment that
ideal out to you you can earn it back
and we can go back into a cooperative
state right so it's it's worth it to me
to punish you because I know that it's
not going to cost me anything in the
long run and it stabilizes your behavior
in the short run sure makes perfect
sense so it becomes a plausible threat I
like it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
