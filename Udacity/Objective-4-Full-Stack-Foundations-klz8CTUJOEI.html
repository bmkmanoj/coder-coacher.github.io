page we executed a query to get all of
the restaurants in the database I will
use the ID number of each restaurant
entry in order to find a specific
restaurant to update let's go ahead and
replace that hashtag with the restaurant
ID number and then a backslash and the
word edit to indicate a new path where
we will edit our menu entries I will now
create another if statement that looks
for a backslash edit in my URL since I
chose to edit restaurants by their ID I
need to find a way to grab that ID
number out of the URL the split command
in Python comes in handy here and
returns an array of strings separated by
the backslash I figured out that the
third value of this array contains my ID
number so with this two here I'm
grabbing the third element of this zero
indexed array I then do a restaurant
query to grab the restaurant entry equal
to the ID in the URL if I find that
query then I generate a response and
begin to render the page I can create a
form with one field for the new
restaurant name let's create a post
method and pass in the path for the
backslash restaurants backslash ID
backslash edit passing the idea of the
restaurant I want to edit I also
prefilled this field with the current
name of the restaurant I close all my
tags and add this output string to the W
file now let's write up the post
response for our edit form some of this
code might be starting to look pretty
familiar after making another if
statement we grab the input from our
form again then we perform the query to
find the object with the matching ID we
reset the name field to the entry we
created in the form then add to the
session and commit I then edit a
redirect to bring us back to our
restaurants page after the code has been
executed this was a lot of code to write
so let's save and rerun our server again
to see if it worked if I rename panda
garden to the new Panda garden look it's
been updated in the database and on our
restaurants page the source code for
objective 4 is also available in the
instructor notes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
