to build a random tester I hope that
you'll build many of them in the future
and most of the rest of this course is
going to be spent going into more
details about how we build effective
random testers but before we do that
what I'd like to do is an address an
issue that eventually confronts almost
everybody who works on random testing
which is the random testing gets no
respect and what I mean by that is
people often think that it's really
stupid way to test software for example
one of the classic references on
software testing is a book called the
art of software testing in this book the
author talks about random testing and
here's what he has to say probably the
poorest methodology of all is random
input testing what we look for is a set
of thought processes that allow one to
select a set of test data more
intelligently so basically what Myers is
saying is random input testing is not a
way that allows one to select a set of
test data intelligently and so my
opinion and this is after writing at
least a dozen random testers what you
should have said is something like what
we look for when testing is a set of
thought processes that allow one to
randomly generate a set of test data
more intelligently and so we can't do is
get around this fact that testing
requires thought about the software
under test but my experience and the
experience of a lot of other people is
that if we think hard about a random
test case generator that's as good or
better in many cases than thinking hard
about generating the test cases
themselves so another classic piece of
work is a book chapter called random
testing by Richard Hamlett and in this
chapter he says most criticism of random
testing is really objection to miss
application of the method using
inappropriate input distributions and so
what Hamlet is really talking about here
is the input validity problem that we've
just been discussing and what he means
is that if you ignore the input validity
problem and you just test randomly using
completely random garbage you're going
to get a bad impression of the method
because it's not going to work very well
you're going to experience a phenomenon
that we talked about a little bit ago
where all of the test cases get rejected
by very early parts of the software
under test and so I would actually say
what Pamela said a little bit
differently most criticism random
testing is really objection random
testing done badly so let's look at one
more quote so the author of testing 40
bugs has to say is the introduction of
random testing practically eliminated
user bug reports on released backends to
our amazement r IG this is their test
case generator was able to find over
half of all bugs reported by customers
on the code generator in just one night
of runtime and so this clearly was
written by somebody who did a really
good job creating a random tester and
also probably applied in the domain
where an of testing happened to work
really well the rest of this testing 40
bugs is worth reading as well and we
will include a
link to that in the supplemental
material for the course</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
