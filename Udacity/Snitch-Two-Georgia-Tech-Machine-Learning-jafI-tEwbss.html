because that's what we've been doing all
along and he can either choose to
cooperate or you can choose to defect
now by the way I'm saying cooperate and
defect here because their terms of art
not because these are the words I would
have chosen okay be can do the same
thing you can choose to cooperate or
beacon choose to defect now I've set up
the game in a particular way here the
the cops have set up the game in a
particular way here if B defects but a
cooperates then B gets to walk and a has
to pay the price nine months in jail so
I'm gonna put into this cell minus nine
zero so this means this is the value of
this set of strategies for a and this is
the value for B so the first number in
the pair is what a gets and the second
number is what B gets okay got you with
me okay now notice we have to do this
now because it's no longer zero-sum it's
not gonna always add up to a constant
well it so far it's a constant nine
that's right oh and in fact it looks
this way as well because I have a
symmetric deal here so if a defects and
B cooperates a gets to walk and B goes
to jail for nine months okay yep so
right now you're right it's looking like
a zero-sum game but it isn't because
what happens if both a and B drop a dime
on each other
well they both confessed so it's a
little good it's a little bit better
than having one of them only one of them
confess the deal that the DA is willing
to give them is that both of them will
spend six months in jail now these are
just these are just the the numbers that
are a part of the game this is I'm not
computing this from anywhere this is
just the way the cops have set this up
and I'm gonna now what's an interesting
question here is what happens if both a
and B keep their mouth shut they both
choose to cooperate it turns out that
it's not a perfect world because they
were caught with a bunch of guns they
didn't have permits for so if neither
one of them in mitts to robbing the bank
they're still gonna do a little bit of
time but in this case it's a small
weapons charge
and so each only spends a month in jail
I see so now it's definitely not
zero-sum because we have a negative two
there negative twelve there
nine and a negative nine right okay okay
so you got the game you understand it
yeah so it's very simple now just
looking at this what's the best possible
outcome for the two of them so if they
cooperate with each other then there's a
you know one month later they're back on
the streets back to their criminal
activities where they're reformed you
never know sure back to their choice of
whether to have criminal activities the
mutual defection one that where they
both defect
it's either while twelve months or six
months depending on how you think about
it but they don't do nearly as well and
then the defect and cooperate it seems
like there's a lot of incarceration that
will happen so it feels like the best
for the for the two of them is the
mutual cooperate cooperate cooperate
yeah and that makes sense this is sort
of what you want to happen
both of them keep their mouths shut they
do a little bit of time but on average
they do pretty well right yep so my
question to you is is that gonna happen
sure why wouldn't it happen well you
tell me if I know that you're gonna
cooperate let's say that I'm a okay and
you're B and I know that you're gonna
cooperate what should I do
you should cooperate should I you chosen
you chosen this column right I see well
if you think of it that way that it's
not a joint choice but it's actually an
individual choosing then you're better
off defecting because then you get off
scot-free yep then but I go to jail for
nine months I can have a whole baby in
that time
well usually takes closer to ten but
sure but you go to jail for nine months
I don't so if you are just that cold I
guess cuz your criminal it doesn't
matter remember the matrix is everything
the value of doing this to me is zero
versus minus one all right that's cool
that's cold man I agree but it's what
the numbers tell you what if it wasn't
criminal what if it was just you know
the amount of money that I was gonna win
an input in a mini poker game yeah but
it's a different kind of mini poker game
cuz we're both cuz it's like you beat me
but by beating me that way you like
nearly killed me so are you saying that
once so are you saying you always let me
win whenever we play poker
no okay then because you're cold is that
what you're saying no exactly right so
the point Michael is that if I know
you're gonna cooperate you're gonna
choose this column then I should affect
okay all right so fine so now going to
jail for nine months mm-hmm if you
choose to cooperate aha if if it's good
so what you're saying is I could drop a
dime on you you could so you could
choose to defect and if I knew you're
gonna choose to defect what would I do
well you already you already showed your
colors man you're defecting so I'm just
switching I'm just saving myself three
months bye-bye ratting you out yeah so
we would end up here by the way you know
that this game is symmetric right No
you defected first no here's the thing
this is the only thing I care about is
maximizing my own reward my own value
I'm gonna do the thing that makes sense
for me to do in this case which is if
you cooperate the fact if you defect the
fact but you would do the same thing
because your whole goal here is to
maximize your value yeah well you don't
know me like that yes I do because it's
everything that's here in the matrix
this is the wonderful thing about game
theory all the stuff that you're
concerned about it's all inside the
matrix remember the rules of the game
don't matter
there's no prisoners here there are no
criminals there's just I get a dollar I
lose a dollar or I lose $0 I lose $9 or
I lose $6 or for that matter since I
lose one penny or I lose no paintings I
lose nine paintings or I lose six
pennies it doesn't matter this is the
value of these particular strategies and
I'm gonna want a defect if you cooperate
you'll notice if you defect I'm also
gonna wonder the fact in fact if you
look closely at this matrix you should
notice something Michael from A's point
of view when does it make sense for me
to cooperate versus defect you mean if
you have some kind of probabilistic
policy over cooperating defect oh no not
even that just in general is there ever
a time as a that I would rather
cooperate than defect or vice versa
oh I see so if I know you're gonna
cooperate I should defect to save myself
a month but if I know you're gonna
defect I should defect to save myself
three months either way I'm coming out
ahead right so in fact let's take a look
at this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
