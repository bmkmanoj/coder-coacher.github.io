computing the clustering coefficient at
least one particular way of computing it
here's our list of flights on our map
you know connection between chicago and
seattle etc and i just have that as a
list of pairs and to create the graph i
start off with an empty graph and then
for each of the pairs that constitute
the endpoints of a flight we make a link
between them like we're doing last time
then to compute the clustering
coefficient for the graph at some node
we list out the neighbors if there's
only one neighbor it turns out to be
very hard to compute the clustering
coefficient so we have to give it some
kind of value I chose 0 it actually kind
of matters but 0 seems like a reasonable
choice then what we're going to do is
we're going to count up the number of
links between these neighbor nodes so we
start that off at zero we loop through
all the neighbors and for each of those
we loop through all the neighbors again
and then we ask is this paired w you is
there a link between them and if so in
this case I'm counting it as a half
because I wrote this inefficiently it's
going to do everything twice so it's
going to notice that Seattle and Los
Angeles are connected and that Los
Angeles NZ ala connected so I give it a
half each time so that the total number
works out and then then I apply the
formula two times the number of links /
native length of neighbors times length
of neighbors minus 1 so now that we can
compute the clustering coefficient for
any node V we can actually look through
all the nodes in the graph computing
there the total of their custard
clustering coefficients and then divide
by the number of nodes to get the
clustering coefficient for the whole
graph so in this case it's a little bit
above a quarter which is you know pretty
clumpy so there's a fair amount of
interconnection between the nodes
neighbors from what I've read social
networks will often have clustering
coefficients that are in those sort of
point one maybe even up to the point
eight range whereas grid graphs and
chain graphs and ring graphs that we've
looked at actually have clustering
coefficient of 0</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
