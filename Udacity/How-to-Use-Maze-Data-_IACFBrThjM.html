going to use a P list and that JSON file
that both represent a maze like the one
you've seen in the maze app let's start
by peeking at the P list at the top
level it contains account for the number
of rows the number of columns and some
cell data the cell data is an array and
if we drop down we can see that it
contains arrays as well and if we click
one of the arrays it contains more
arrays Wow and if we click one of the
arrays then we see that we have these
four boolean values and this repeats for
every single one of the inner most
arrays now that was pretty ugly to look
at and it may seem complicated but what
it's really modeling is a 2d grid each
of the innermost arrays describes a grid
cell of the one seen here and it tells
us if the grid cell contains a wall or a
path on the top the right the bottom or
the left of the cell now let's take a
look at this cell that we've marked in
blue the first value in the array is
true or yes these map pretty directly so
that means that there should be a wall
on the top the next value is also true
so that means there should also be a
wall on the right the next item we have
an O or a false so there's no wall where
we'd say that there's a path on the
bottom of the cell and the same goes for
the left now if you think back to the
maze app these top right bottom and left
represents the walls and the paths and
you can see that more clearly here that
cell that we were just looking at it's
the cell in the top right hand corner
and we can see that the top and right
are true so we have a wall on the top
and the right but the bottom and the
left are false
so there's a path here now if we go back
to the plist file we'll see that the
number of arrays here matches the number
of rows so we have five rows and then we
have one two three four five arrays the
number of arrays within a row one two
three four five six seven matches the
number of columns so this P list
describes a 5x7 maze now the JSON file
contains the exact same data but it's
formatted a little bit differently and
as we're looking at it here it's kind of
hard to read it's not very pretty
now when you're faced with JSON like
this I'd recommend copy and pasting it
into an online JSON tool that purifies
it and prettify or prettify it's not a
real word I mean to say that it formats
the JSON so it's much easier to read so
we'll go ahead and copy this and then
this is JSON pretty print comm and we'll
paste it in and then we'll run and
that's much better so again if you have
some really complex JSON that's kind of
mangled and you want to spread it out
and make it pretty and easier to read
I'd recommend using a tool like this so
now that we have a rough idea of what
this data looks like and it represents
what can we do with it so let's think
about how we would model this in code
here's a struct that represents one of
the cells that we saw so it's got four
boolean values true and false values
representing whether there's a wall or a
path for the top right bottom and left
and as we saw a second ago based on the
true and false values in each array for
each grid cell we could determine
whether there's a wall or a path so
these are a couple examples that give us
an idea of what the grid cell might look
like so when everything is true we have
walls on the top of the left the right
and the bottom when this last pull value
is false and that represents the left
then the left side has a path well
everything else has a wall and then if
everything is false then we have a path
that goes to the top the left the right
and the bottom so let's imagine that we
have this simplified version of the cell
data it only has two rows and two
columns and if we were to go through
each grid cell then we would result in a
representation that's something like
this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
