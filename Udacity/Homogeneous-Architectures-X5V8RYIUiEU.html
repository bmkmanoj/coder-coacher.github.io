can be characterized as follows
any node can process any type of request
and can do any of the processing actions
that are required in the end-to-end
request processing again this resembles
the basic boss worker model the
front-end component is the boss
responsible for pushing requests on to
the workers and all the workers can
perform all of the required steps for a
request the benefit of this is that the
front end can be me kept fairly simple
it doesn't have to keep track which one
of the nodes can perform which
particular action or can service which
types of requests instead the front end
can simply in a round robin manner
assent requests on to the next available
node or the front end could be enhanced
in some simple way in which it keeps
some information regarding the CPU loads
the CP utilization on the other nodes in
the system and then it can use that type
of information to direct requests onto
the worker nodes this design doesn't
mean that every single one of the nodes
has to store all of the data all of the
state that's needed for the internet
service instead data may be somehow
replicated or distributed across these
nodes but with the homogeneous design
every single one of the nodes knows how
to get how to access any type of
information that may be necessary for
the execution of the service one
downside of this approach is that there
is little opportunity to benefit from
caching if the front-end is simple and
it just passes requests round-robin
on to the other nodes it may not be able
and in fact it will not be able to
explore opportunities like this
particular node already serviced some
state and therefore it's likely present
in its cache and it will not need to
perform a remote access in order to
access that particular information</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
