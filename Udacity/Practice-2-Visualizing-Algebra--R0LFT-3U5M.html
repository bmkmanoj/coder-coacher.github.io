excellent work just like in the first
practice problem we want to get the
boundary line so let's solve this
inequality for why first we subtract 3x
from both sides then we divide both
sides of the inequality by negative 5
remember both these terms need to be
divided by negative 5 and here we need
to be really careful we divided by a
negative so we need to reverse the
inequality sign now we're ready to graph
the y intercept is negative 3 which is
here three units down from the origin
our slope is positive 3 fifths so we
rise three units up and run 5 units to
the right now I have two points and I
can draw in my boundary line I have a
less than symbol so I need to draw a
dashed line because I can't include
points on the line and finally we use a
test point determine which region should
be shaded the top region or the lower
region if i plug in 0 for x and 0 for y
i get 0 is less than negative 3 I know
the statement isn't true so I don't want
points in this region I want this region
this should be my solution region and I
can test another point in this region to
be sure i'm going to use the point 0
negative 4 and remember you could choose
any point in this region it wouldn't
matter if i plug in 0 for x and negative
4 for y i get negative 4 is less than
negative 3 this is a true statement so
yeah I did this problem correctly</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
