interesting in terms of the graph of
this equation let's take a look at
what's going on so we have this equation
which relates number of weeks to the
money owed X to Y and we know that at
zero weeks or x equals 0 y equals 200 he
owes two hundred dollars and the x
equals 20 y equals zero so after 20
weeks he doesn't know any money and I
can represent these as ordered pairs in
this case 0 comma 200 and in this case
20.com is 0 and if this is my graph
paper I'm going to make each of these
lines represent let's say five on the
x-axis so 5 10 15 20 and each of the
lines are presented 50 on the y-axis so
50 100 150 200 well then I can plot
these points 0 comma 220 comma 0 and we
see that their special points this point
0 comma 200 is special because it's
right on the y-axis and so we call it
the y-intercept it's going to be where
the graph intercepts the y-axis and this
point well it lives right on the x-axis
so you might be able to guess this is
what we call the x intercept and what's
really cool is that these two points
fully describe a line they represent all
the information I need to know to draw a
graph because all i have to do is
connect the dots and generally i want to
extend my line to continue in either
direction as well and i almost forgot to
label my axes now why don't we practice
with a slightly different graph can you
tell me what the x and y-intercepts are
for this graph enter the x and y
coordinates of the x intercept and
likewise for the y intercept</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
