strategies in this game that has an
uncertain ending
we can't just write down sequences of of
actions anymore we can't just say
cooperate defect defect defect defect or
even some kind of tree of possibilities
because those are going to be finite
representations we need some other
representation that allows us to play
for an unbounded number of rounds and
I'm gonna start off by presenting an
example of such a strategy one that's
that's very famous for the iterated
prisoner's dilemma and it's called
tit-for-tat and the structure of
tit-for-tat goes like this on the first
round of the game a player playing the
strategy will cooperate and then in all
future rounds the player is going to
copy the opponent's previous move that
makes sense it does so basically we
start I start out acting as if you're
going to cooperate with me and the
moment you don't cooperate with me I
will start to defect and we'll be in the
old-style prisoner's dilemma rate that's
what this says is it actually copies the
opponent's previous move so if an
opponent goes cooperate defect cooperate
defect cooperate defect defect defect
defect cooperate cooperate you're gonna
see something very similar coming out of
the tit for tat agent Oh in fact we can
represent the strategy as a little
finite state machine like this and you
so you can see exactly how it kind of
proceeds it starts off cooperating and
then in each each round it waits to see
what the opponent does that's the green
letters here and then it follows the
corresponding arrow to determine whether
it is going to cooperate or defect in
the in the current round sure that makes
sense
so in this picture the black letters
here represent my move and the green
letters represent my observation of the
opponent's move or at least if I'm being
tit-for-tat</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
