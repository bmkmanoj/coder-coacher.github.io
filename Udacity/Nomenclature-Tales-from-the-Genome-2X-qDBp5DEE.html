hard let's take the name in order deoxy
here deoxy what do you think that means
is probably missing an oxygen so the
deoxy part of the name for DNA describes
this part of the chemistry the next part
ribe 0 indicates that there's a ribose
sugar as part of the deoxynucleotide
this is the sugar molecule called a
ribose sugar so that's what the ribose
ents in the name nucleic was probably
the toughest one if you couldn't figure
it out actually represents the
nitrogenous base here or the nucleic
acid this means that it's found in the
nucleus and then the last bit actually
over here the acid is an artifact from
this what we call a phosphate group
right here under certain conditions when
DNA was first isolated is it actually
had acidic properties and it's because
of the nature of this group right here
so you can see that the name
deoxyribonucleic acid which is the long
form for the act for the abbreviation
DNA actually it's just describing the
chemistry of missing an oxygen being
part of a ribose sugar containing a
nitrogenous base that can be found in
the nucleus and also containing a group
that can be acidic under certain
conditions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
