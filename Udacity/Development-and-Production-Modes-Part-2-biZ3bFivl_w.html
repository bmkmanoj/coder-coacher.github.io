folder that holds all generated files
separate from the source files this
wasn't a problem with SAS as we
generated the CSS into a separate
high-level CSS folder but it would be
with JavaScript because we don't want
our source and distribution files to
commingle the process is pretty simple
we first copy our index that HTML into
the disk folder then generate our CSS
into dist CSS and finally generate our
combined javascript file into dist j/s
since we've already got our CSS set up
let's change what's needed in our Styles
task here is our Styles task in the
growing file and we can see our
destination is set to just the CSS
directory to make it show up under this
desk directory here we just change the
destination to dist / CSS and when we
run gulp styles we can see that the
files have been generated and dropped in
the correct folder next let's copy the
index that HTML and images to the disk
folder we simply set up to new task and
call them something like copy HTML and
copy images in the copy HTML task we
grab the index that HTML file with gulp
that source and just pipe it to the
destination in the disk folder for the
copy images task we do the same thing
but instead of copying a file or
grabbing a locator to a file we're
grabbing all the files in a specific
directory in piping them to our
destination location you'll want to set
up a new gulp dot watch next to the
others that watches the original index
file you could do the same with the
images but they don't change that often
and don't forget to add the two new task
to the rave that's passed as part of the
default task otherwise the files don't
get copied over the first time we run
gulp just the final fix before we can
see our page run again minus the
JavaScript which will come in a bit you
will need to modify the browser sink
that init function call and make it
point to the disk directory now I've
already done this for you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
