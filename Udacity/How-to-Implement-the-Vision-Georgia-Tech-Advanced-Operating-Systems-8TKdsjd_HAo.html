let's see how we can implement the
vision in order to implement this vision
the operating system should provide
quality of service api's to the
application and these quality of service
api is could be things like oh this
particular network flow that i'm
creating has certain real time
constraints because it has video data
and so on and so forth and those are the
hints that the operating system is going
to use in terms of synthesizing code
that corresponds to the api that the
operating system is providing you to
give hints to the network so the code
that the operating system is going to
synthesize is essentially taking the
quality of service constraints and
putting them as executable code that can
be then passed around as part of the
packet so in other words the protocol
stack of the operating system has to be
enhanced to service these quality of
service requirements and generate or
synthesize the code that has to be part
of the payload so the application is not
only providing a payload but it is
giving quality of service constraints
and the operating system in addition to
the payload generates or synthesizes
code corresponding to this quality of
service instructions and it slaps on the
IP header for where this particular
message is eventually to be delivered
and hands it over to the Internet and in
the Internet if you assume that the
Internet routers are capable of
executing the specialized code then
depending on the nature of what is being
requested a particular order may say oh
this particular packet I have to send it
to multiple destinations from let me
send it down this link down this link
and similarly when it comes over here
this router may say oh this particular
packet has to go to multiple
destinations and so on and that way we
can see that intelligent routing
decisions can be taken in the network
that's sort of the roadmap of how we can
take this vision and try to implement it
but the problem with carrying out the
vision in terms of this implementation
that I just sketched is that changing
the operating system is non-trivial
especially the protocol stack as I
already mentioned tcp/ip
has several hundred thousand lines of
code so it is non-trivial to change the
protocol stack of every node in the
entire universe to handle active
networks and also the second part of the
challenge is that the network routers
are not open so in other words we cannot
expect that every router and the
Internet is capable of processing the
code that I'm going to slap on to the
Spay load and be able to make
intelligent routing decisions so there
is an impedance mismatch between the
vision and the implementation that I've
sketched right here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
