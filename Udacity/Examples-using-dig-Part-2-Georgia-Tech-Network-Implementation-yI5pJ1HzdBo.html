looking at a trace of an entire lookup
now in the examples before we didn't get
to see the full lookup hierarchy because
we issued a recursive query but let's
suppose that we wanted to see every step
of the DNS lookup process you can do
this by using the trace option in dig
here you can see exactly what we saw
before which is the local resolver in
this case issuing a query to a local
resolver and receiving a referral to an
authoritative server for dot which could
be any of the following that query
elicits an answer for the dot edu
servers which subsequently issues a
referral to the servers that are
authoritative for Ghatak which
ultimately reply with the appropriate a
records as well as the authoritative
name servers for got a CD you a final
interesting example explores how to map
an IP address back to a name in this
case we're ultimately looking for a PTR
record which is the name corresponding
to this IP address but first what
happens is we receive a special referral
when we ask the root servers about this
particular IP address instead of being
referred to a particular comm or edu
domain were referred to a special
top-level domain called in adder DARPA
which maintains referrals to
authoritative servers that are
maintained by the respective internet
routing registries such as Aron ripe
APNIC and so forth so here we see a
referral to NI DARPA subsequently we see
a referral to 130 dot n at ARPA
corresponding to the first octet of the
IP address next when we ask Erin about
130 dot in adder ARPA we receive another
referral which is to 207 dot 130 dot an
adder ARPA and because 130 dot 207 is
allocated to got a CD you Aaron knows
that the appropriate referral for this
part of the address space is to DNS one
two or three dot got a CD you next we
issue a query for the next part of the
octet 7.2 o7 dot 130 in a nerd ARPA
corresponding to the first three
it's and now we actually get the PTR
because DNS 3 that got a edu knows the
reverse mapping between one 3207 dot
7.36 and the name for that IP address so
you can see that the PTR records or
those that map IP addresses to names are
resolved through a special hierarchy
through in a door
ARPA at the route followed by a walk
through the regional registries and
ultimately to the domains such as Ghatak
that are responsible for particular
regions of the IP address space</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
