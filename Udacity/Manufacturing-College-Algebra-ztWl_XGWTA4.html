equation really is and what types of
equations there are let's actually build
some up to do that we're going to keep
helping grant deal with his
manufacturing process since grants
claiming glasses has started
manufacturing now they actually have to
pay for things namely the materials they
use to make glasses wipers and nozzles
to buy just the material that he needed
to make the wipers that were produced in
the first four days grant spent five
hundred ninety-eight dollars he's
thinking that next week he'll need to
spend around seven hundred fifty dollars
to start the nozzle manufacturing
process we know from that chart we made
earlier that he was able to make 92
glasses wipers in the first four days oh
and he also told me that he took his
friends out to lunch and he spent fifty
four more dollars on that to plan for
the future grants getting a little bit
worried there are a lot of different
numbers needs to keep track of he wants
to know how much he spends on the
materials to make just one set of wiper
blades but he needs our help to sift
through all of these numbers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
