sometimes it might be better to know how
much cake was not frosted let's look at
a simple case of this if two-thirds of a
cake is frosted with vanilla icing what
fraction is not frosted well let's start
off by looking at a cake here's a whole
chocolate cake and I'm going to ice two
thirds of it so I've split my k-cup into
thirds and I iced two of those thirds
here's one-third and two-thirds one way
to think about this is that the parts
must add up to the whole I know that I
have two thirds of the cake frosted of
vanilla icing and I have to add some
amount to get a whole cake so I know two
thirds plus some amount has to equal one
well this last piece is just one third
so I can just put one third here this is
the amount that's not frosted and
remember back from adding fractions we
know we just need to count up the thirds
I have one-third two-thirds and three
thirds all together so this piece that's
not frosted is one-third there's
actually another way that we can think
about this let's instead start with a
whole cake and subtract off the parts
that we don't want we don't want the
vanilla icing so let's subtract the
pieces we don't want from the entire
whole cake I started with one whole cake
and I'm subtracting off two thirds well
I know one whole cake is the same thing
as 3 thirds remember I can just write
one as 1/1 because that's still one and
then i can multiply this fraction by 3
over 3 i'm just going to turn one into
thirds or three thirds so i have three
thirds minus two thirds which is one
third one third of my cake is not
frosted and what's interesting about
fractions is that it doesn't matter how
much cake we're talking about we could
have started with a different cake maybe
we started with a rectangular cake
here's a rectangular cake and I'm going
to ice two thirds of it doing the same
problem with a rectangular cake doesn't
change my answer I still have two thirds
of it frosted of vanilla icing and
one-third that's left on frosted the
amount of cake that's frosted or on
frosted depends on the size and shape of
the original cake the neat thing about
fractions is that two thirds could
describe this part of a round cake or
this part of a rectangular cake
fractions describe a part of a whole
object</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
