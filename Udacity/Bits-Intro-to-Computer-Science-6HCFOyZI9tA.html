smallest unit of your formation so
suppose I tell you that there are two
boxes there's a green box and a blue box
and in one of those two boxes there's a
Goldstar and it's equally likely to be
in either the green box out of the blue
box one bit is the answer to one
yes-or-no question so if you ask one yes
or no question you ask is the Goldstar
in the green box then you get one bit
back is the response so you get an
answer that's either yes or no and when
you learn which one it is that's one bit
of information that allows you to go
from having two choices down to one
choice and then you know well if the
answer was yes the gold stars in the
green box that's the one you should open
so when we think about bits in computing
we don't usually call them yes or no
we call them 0 n 1 0 more readily maps -
no and 1 - yes so I switch blue and
green here but we could pick any two
things we could use green and blue we
could use yes and no if we have two
things and we can choose one of them
knowing which one to choose is one bit
of information so that's what one bit
can do it allows us to decide between
two things for the ancient Greeks
Network maybe that's all it could
transmit there was either the no bit
which said there weren't any enemies
arriving or if there was a smoke signal
that was one bit saying yes there is an
enemy arriving so it's possible if it
was only able to transmit that one
message that it only conveyed one bit of
information if all we can do is send
bits we can send either a 0 or 1 or yes
or no but let's think of it as zero and
ones now can we send anything more
interesting can we just send one thing
and it turns out that we can actually
send everything that we want just using
bits so instead of just picking between
two boxes now let's suppose there were
four boxes so let's say there's a purple
box and there's a dark red box so now
there four boxes there's still only one
gold star so can we figure out which box
the gold star is in with just yes/no
questions well one way to do that would
be to ask for questions right we could
say is it in the green box
we could ask is it in the purple box we
could ask is it in the blue box and as
long as we know there's at least one
gold star we don't really need to ask if
it's in the dark red box because if we
got nose for all three of these well
then we know they answer that next
question if we ask the photos in the red
box would be yes so here we needed up to
three questions to figure out which box
the gold star was in can we do better so
the question is how many bits do we need
to find the gold star and we remember
each bit is the answer to one yes-or-no
question and we have four possible boxes
and the gold star could be in any one of
those four</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
