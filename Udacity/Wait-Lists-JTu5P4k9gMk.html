registration and especially what to do
in a class you want is full so here i've
looked up a different class and intro to
cognitive science class but what i find
is that this class is full i know it's
full for two different reasons first
over on the Left there's a c' c' means
closed that means and no spots left in
this class secondly there are three
columns over on the right that represent
the current enrollment in the class the
columns are cap act and rim cap
represents the capacity of the class act
represents the number of active students
currently registered for the class and
rim represents the remaining slots in
the class for this class I know it's
full because there are zero remaining
slots when that happens what I have to
do is join the waitlist for the class
there are three similar columns that
represent the status of the waitlist WL
cap WL act and WL of RAM just like the
columns for regular registration WL cap
wll act in WL RAM represent the capacity
the active number of students and the
remaining slots specifically on the
waitlist so if I want to join a full
class I have to join the waitlist to
join the waitlist I have to use the
second of the two registration methods
we talked about first I have to note the
classes CRN number in this case it's
five five one one zero and then I have
to return to the add or drop classes
page usually I would do that through the
registration menu but between you and me
you can actually get to it just by
clicking Add to worksheet whether or not
you have anything selected that will
take you back to the add drop classes
page scrolling down we want to go back
to the CRN section you want to enter the
five digit CRN number that you noted
before and again click Submit changes
now here what's going to happen is
you're going to be given an error like
we talked about under registration add
errors you'll see closed as the status
of your registration under the action
menu you can click wait-listed course
click Submit changes again and the
course will now appear as a wait-listed
course under your current schedule in
the event that a slot in the wait-listed
course becomes available you'll receive
an email and you can return to this page
and register for the course the way we
did before you only have a limited
window of time to register for the
course however so make sure to do so
as soon as possible for more information
on how long you have to register once
you receive that email check the
registrar's website that can change from
semester to semester</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
