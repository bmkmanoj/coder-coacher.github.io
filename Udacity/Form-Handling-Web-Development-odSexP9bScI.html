rendering that front HTML form that's
what we've been editing let's go ahead
and add our our post function to deal
with what the user types to us okay so
we add the post function first thing we
need to do is get the parameters out of
the request soft out requests get title
and stuff that requests get art and that
will get those values from the the post
from the form submission let's go ahead
and add some basic error handling okay
so I've added the the shell of our kind
of error handling so if we have both the
title and art for now we're just going
to say thanks you know that's just a
stub if we don't have a title in art
we're gonna say we're going to set this
error variable and then we're going to
render the form with our error message
so I'm gonna pass the the error variable
I made into this function render and
which is going to pass it to our
template and so we need to add a place
for our error in our template let's put
this right at the bottom of the form
okay so I've made a basic diff I'm going
to call it class error because I have
intentions of styling this later to make
the text read and classes are how we
attach CSS styles to things now what I'm
going to do is I'm going to say curly
curly error closed Curly's and I'm going
to close this diff now what this does
this is part of our template language
this includes the any variables that the
template is rendered with it'll render
them right in place here so this is a
little bit nicer than the string
substitution thing we were doing before
and while I'm in here I'm going to go
ahead and add a submit button because we
forgot that before so we're going to
give this a test here we are in our form
if I click the submit button without
submitting anything we render our form
and we see our error message that's
perfect if I type in just a title and I
click Submit again the form with the
error message just the art perfect and
now if I type in both I see thanks okay
so it looks like this thing is working
one thing I want you to notice is when I
type in text in the text field I hit
submit and we get our error we lost our
text remember we've we've dealt with
this before so let's go ahead and fix
that bug while we're while we're sitting
here first thing I'm going to do is I'm
going
pull out the rendering of the front page
into its own function because we're
gonna be calling it from both get and
post and I don't want to have some of
this logic that we're about to write
duplicate it so let's go ahead and add a
new function to our class so let's
create a new class called render front
and this is going to render our our
front page it's gonna take in a few
parameters how about the title which
will default to nothing the artwork
which also default to nothing and the
error message which also will default to
nothing and all this functions going to
do right now is it's going to call self
dot render front dot HTML and we're
going to pass in title equals title art
equals art and error equals error all
we're doing here and you should remember
the structure I hope from the previous
lesson
we're just taking this variable title
and passing it in to the template and so
we can use these variables in the
template when we when we're rendering
our form now what I'm gonna do is I'm
going to replace this call of self that
render to self dot render front that'll
draw the blank form and then I'm going
to replace this call to self that render
to self dot render front and this will
render our form with the error message
and one final thing we need to do is
actually make use of these variables so
let's go ahead and do that here we are
in our input for the title let's
preserve the title so I'm going to do
I'm going to include the title variable
passed in from the other function and
then in our text area I'm going to
include any art that was passed in okay
let's give this all a test reloading
this page doesn't break anything if I
type in a title and we're testing we're
gonna test our error submission and I
click Submit we should see our error
message and we suits the title it's
still in title box hmm okay we see our
error message we don't see title in
title box let's go investigate why</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
