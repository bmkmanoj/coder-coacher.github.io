transfusion why would ha she was in a
car accident she's lost a lot of blood
and she may not survive if she doesn't
get the transfusion soon okay well
what's your blood type I don't know when
you'd find out knowing a person's blood
type can be really important if you give
somebody the wrong blood type their
immune system can mount a response and
actually cause you harm so how does the
body know it's the wrong blood type well
your immune system does a really good
job at recognizing self versus non-self
and it does this because when you're
growing up it knows the blood type that
you're growing up with because that's
what it's exposed to and so when it sees
a blood type that it doesn't recognize
it knows it doesn't belong there and it
tries to attack it sounds really
important no wonder there's so many
tests you can take to tell what your
blood type is right and the clinic
that's very true but what's really cool
is your genome reveals the same
information in this lesson we're going
to discover how your genome uses its
code to create your blood type also
here's an incomplete concept map for
lesson 3 but you can also download from
the instructors notes as usual print it
out or just keep it handy and see if you
can fill in the empty blanks you should
go through the lesson now if you prefer
to have the complete version just skip
to the end and look in the instructors
notes for the complete concept map
however I highly encourage you to try
using this incomplete version now
filling in your own notes as the lesson
progresses and then we'll check your
progress out on the completed map at the
end of the lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
