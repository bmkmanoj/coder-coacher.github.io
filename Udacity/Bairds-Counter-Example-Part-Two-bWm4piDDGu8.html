w's and taking the dot product with the
feature weights if the weights are all
zero it's always going to predict zero
which is actually the correct answer for
this MDP so this it's really easy to set
the weights so that that happens is
there is that the only way to set the
weights to make this happen no because
in fact for each one of those states
there's only two features that are
turned on and there are different two
features for every state except for
state zero so you could be pretty clever
about it so I think if you make the wait
for zero minus one maybe and then make
features one through six one-half that
would get you zero for everything except
state seven and then state seven just
needs it to be seven seven or seventh
7/7 so in particular this weight vector
times this feature vector is going to
give us well minus 7 plus zero plus zero
plus zero zero plus 7 so zero for this
other one it's going to give us minus
one plus zero plus zero plus zero zero
zero zero plus one which is zero so yeah
so this is a this is a weight vector so
not only can we represent the value
function but we can represent it in
multiple different ways it is multiple--
representable which i spelled wrong
multiplicity which is spelled the same
as multiply but it's representable in at
least two ways actually an infinite
number of ways because you could take
that vector minus one one half when I
have one have another seven and multiply
it by any constant including zero and
then work oh nice multiply it by zero
you get that first weight vector that we
talked about anything else that we get
we're multiplying zero times a constant
so in fact there's an infinite set of
weight vectors that all capture the
optimal value function which is all
zeros and so you know we have plenty of
rope we should be able to build a rope
ladder yeah hang ourselves Oh ultimately
that's actually what's gonna happen in
this case but you know it seems quite
friendly right it's also tiny right yeah
these are all things that would seem
like it should make it so that it's
really easy to get this right so then
let's get it right yeah well so it turns
out that what Baird showed is that if
you give it the right sequence of
updates it will actually spiral out of
control so let's let's take a look at
that okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
