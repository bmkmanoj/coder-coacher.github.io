unit 2 this time instead of dealing with
orbits we have a pendulum and we want to
create expressions for its position
velocity and acceleration as always if
you can use some code to help you out
here you can see the time step the
magnitude of the acceleration due to
gravity and the length of the pendulum
which is just the length of the string
to which the bob of the pendulum is
attached what we're asking you to do is
to first fill in this definition for the
acceleration of the pendulum showing how
it depends on the position of the weight
now if you think about the way that a
pendulum swings you can imagine that if
we extended the trajectory we would get
a circle so position is the length of
this curved path the next thing that you
need to do is to fill in this function
called symplectic Euler in which
logically you will use the symplectic
Euler method to calculate both distance
and velocity so help you out a little
bit here is a refresher on what the
symplectic Euler method says another
important piece of information if you're
not super comfortable with physics stuff
is Newton's second law right here
showing the relationship between a force
mass and acceleration so looking back at
our code you can see that we've created
empty arrays for you for position and
for velocity it's up to you to fill
these arrays in including the initial
conditions so remember you'll need to
initialize X and V by saying X of 0 and
V of 0 equals something that you're
going to figure out I'm going to give
you a few hints though you can see that
we've created this constant called non
initial conditions and set it equal to
15 what you're really doing overall in
this problem is looking at 50 different
pendulums which each have different
initial values for X and V now to give
you a visual of what this looks like I'm
going to show you the final plot that
you'll get with this program so here's
the set of graphs that you should get as
your final result if the program is
working correctly we're going to ignore
these top two graphs for now let's focus
on this bottom plot this is showing
velocity on the vertical axis and
position on the horizontal axis if we
look at the top two graphs we can see
that this green set of points right here
corresponds to what's happening at time
zero this green ellipse down here is
showing the set of initial conditions
for the 50 different pendulums that
we're looking at this green ellipse is
kind of like a snapshot of what's
happening to all of these different
pendulums at time zero the way that I
want you to figure out how to set the
values for each pendulum
for X and for V is to just think about
this ellipse now in unit 1 you learned a
lot about orbits and you'll actually be
able to use some of that knowledge in
this problem knowing that the screen
shape is an ellipse you can see that
it's major axis right here lies along
the line V equals 0 and it's minor axis
lies along this line x equals 2 now the
half length of the major axis is 0.25 so
I guess actually even though it looks
like the major axis here it's really the
minor axis if these two sets of axes
have the same scales applied to them
either way this rightmost point on the
ellipse corresponds to x equals to 0.25
and the leftmost point corresponds to x
equals 1.75 in terms of V we have values
ranging from negative 2 down here to 2
up here so think about what equations
for X and V you would need to create an
ellipse with these dimensions that will
be how you set the initial conditions
for X and V I think this is a really
interesting problem so I hope you enjoy
doing it good luck</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
