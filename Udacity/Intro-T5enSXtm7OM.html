today we're going to continue well
actually we just introduced tracking and
now we're actually going to do some so
remember last time we talked about the
difference between detecting and
tracking detecting we have some operator
and we just find or whatever our target
is in every frame in tracking we're
going to predict the new location of an
object or the expected distribution
location of object using estimated
dynamics so somehow we're estimating the
velocity accelerations whatever and then
we're going to update based upon the
measurements that we take so that's sort
of the shall we say the intuitive way of
describing it what we're going to do
this lesson the next lesson the lesson
after that I don't know probably for the
next eight or seven twelve years or so
what we're going to do is we're going to
make this much more formal and basically
tracking as a form of inference and what
we mean by that is we're going to have
some state of the object some state
we're trying to estimate we're gonna
call that X that's the parameters we
care about but we don't actually know
that so we refer to that as being hidden
and we have a sensor typically it's
going to be a camera for the stuff we're
talking about and what it's doing is
it's taking some measurements it's it's
measuring like our draw detections that
we're doing before and we're going to
refer to those as noisy observations of
whatever the underlying state actually
was the system that we're assuming is
that every time step T the state the
underlying state changes from x of t
minus 1 to X of T so here we have x of t
minus 1 to X of T and then at time T we
get a new observation we get a new
measurement and our goal your mission
should you choose to accept it is to
recover the most likely state time T now
I was thinking about that it's actually
that's not quite right what you want to
do is you really want to estimate not
the most likely state we're going to
cross that out and say the distribution
or density so if i have the density that
is i have some belief about where X
might be I can tell you the most likely
place that would be the highest
probability I can tell you the average
guest
that would be the expected value but the
idea is that we're going to have a
density and so your goal is to recover
estimate this distribution given first
of all everything you've seen so far
right so you've been taking measurements
all along since last Tuesday where is
this thing now and the other thing that
was given to you with some knowledge or
some model of the state dynamics that is
how this thing moves now you may have to
estimate some of the parameters but you
may know that you know I'm going to
assume that this thing has a particular
velocity and the acceleration just some
noise that would be a model that you're
going to assume is no</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
