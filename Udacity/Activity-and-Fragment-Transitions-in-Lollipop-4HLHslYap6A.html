ways to better choreograph moving
between activities firstly a new API
lets you to run a transition when you
launch or leave an activity this allows
you to customize how individual views in
the screen enter or exit we call these
content transitions secondly it added
the ability to create a shared element
transition this is where an element
which is present on two screens
transitions smoothly between them the
result is visual continuity for shared
elements across the two activities
before we dive deeper into these
powerful new api's let's take a second
to talk a little bit about backwards
compatibility so far in the course
almost everything we've covered has been
achievable on all relevant versions of
Android especially with the help of
Android support libraries like app
compat as we've seen in this lesson the
Android animation API is have become
more powerful with each release this
means that some of the more advanced
effects might be impossible or
infeasible to achieve on older devices a
generally good approach for implementing
animations is to use the newest api's
but to then degrade gracefully on all
the devices swapping in simple
animations for the more complex ones
remember that devices are constantly
being refreshed and upgraded so while
working on the newest api's might have a
lower uptake at first the return on
investment will only grow okay let's
take a closer look at the new activity
transitions in 5.0</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
