operation that will be very useful in
building our web crawler and that's the
pop operation pop works like this we
have a list we have dot pop this is
similar to the way we use the find
method there no inputs to pop but we
still need the parentheses to show that
we're calling a procedure and what it
outputs is an element of the list what
pop does is it mutates the list it
removes the final element of the list it
also returns the value of that element
so here's an example if we started by
initializing the variable a to be the
list one two three and then we'll make B
an alias for a so here's what we have
after those two statements we have
created a new list with elements 1 2 3
and a refers to that list after this
line A to B statement B also refers to
that list then we do X assign a pop to X
so the value of x will be 3 that's what
the last element was that's what we get
returned by pop but it also mutates the
value of the list it removes that
element so now a refers to the list 1 2
since B was an alias for a it also
changed the value of B B is now the list
1 2</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
