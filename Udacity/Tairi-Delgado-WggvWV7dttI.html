the course managers here at Udacity
they're the ones who really work
one-on-one with students to help them
through projects or help them understand
material I think you so much for talking
to me today yeah thanks for inviting me
so the first thing I want to ask you was
many people have this conception that
online education is very impersonal
because we're kind of taking the
synchronous in-person communication out
of it um do you think online education
generally is that impersonal I think it
really is what you make out of it
personally for me like knowing how I
lost things interact with each other I
see students connect each other through
chat facebook linkedin getting together
in groups and I think that kind of love
of interaction you know it doesn't have
to be impersonal it could be something
very rewarding I mean you can meet
somebody you know from Dubai or Mexico
or China somebody that you would never
have a chance to meet before and you
know instantly you could have a
connection with something that you both
have mutual passion for when I look at
online education I think in many ways it
it could be a way to learn things more
in a personal way because like at least
my experience when I was in college was
that you know you would sit in a
classroom with 200-300 people and it's
you know it's very hard to you know talk
to your professor and get one-on-one
advice I found like the most personal
experience you could possibly ever have
is a small group of people that were
your friends who were taking classes
together you could really get the chance
to like work on the problems and really
collaborate with each other the next
best the experience I had was you know
very few times but you know when you had
a one-on-one tutor who really understood
what you were struggling with knew the
material very well knew how to
personalize thing for you I think online
education has the benefit of doing both
because when you're going through these
classes you have the opportunity to
practice on these quizzes at your own
pace and you know when you put in your
answer it's not like somebody just
marking whether it's right or wrong
they're actually trying to tell you
specific feedback about what's wrong and
how to fix it and you get immediate
feedback to work on in practice it more
and I think you know with the ability of
getting groups of people to study
together I think you don't usually have
that in all like settings so to feel to
have that I think it you know can make
online education really great so it
sounds like you're saying that correct
me if I'm wrong that there's certain
ways that we can do things on live it
not only break that impersonal nature
that people think when they think of
online education but in many ways
actually make it even more personal
because you've got people talking you
know over the internet so they can be
available all the time all right leave
messages and come back to them later
right and as a result it's not you know
bottled into this one-hour lecture time
when it's you know we're having a great
discussion but now class is over and we
have to move on or you know you press
there's one hour for office hours a week
and you go talk to them then but you can
Trevor you know interact with them on a
regular basis it sounds like we're
really building in a way to interact
consistently throughout the experience
right actually I'll take it even one
step further I think you know the
traditional model is like you would go
talk to your teacher to get all the
knowledge that you want but i think you
know in this age where we're cost of
learning new things and you know
revitalizing like our skill sets like
sometimes you just need to be able to
learn new things and also facilitate a
collaboration with a group of small
people that you would be working with so
i think you know this is this model has
changed more from a teacher directed
model of presenting lectures more
towards you know this online content
that you can learn and then like if
something doesn't quite make sense you
have a group of people that are willing
to support you because you know they're
trying to accomplish the same thing and
i think you know that that is a powerful
motivator like having a group of people
that you could interact with and help
each other out whereas instead of noon
always going to the teacher you have a
lot more resources to connect with yeah
absolutely i think that's especially the
case in rms program and as well as some
of the audacity and agrees that because
they're so flexible because they're so
open because they're so cost effective
we attract people we wouldn't attract
otherwise and so in on some classes
I've worked on in the past we've had
experiences where someone in the class
is already an expert in their field in
something we're talking about and we can
basically say you know you don't really
need to listen to us about this you've
got someone so over there she's working
on you know world class project in
robotics right and she knows far more
about this than we do and she would
never you know take years off of her
career to go get a masters degree but if
she can do it flexibly like this she
comes and does this and then she in turn
builds the class up even more because
having her there as a resource even if
she's just a student in the class it is
incredible for everybody so yeah the
fact that you bring that up actually
because we constantly like at least I
know for myself like even though like
I've gone through the content I know it
pretty well like there's times like when
you're a marketing students you realize
that there's more to learn and like you
said every student brings their own
perspective and I think on top of that
like when we're talking about these
study groups is that well we tend to
find is that when students explain
things to other students they tend to
learn content even better so I think
that's one of the extra benefits that
normal classroom settings don't really
account for is like having a lot of time
for students to help each other out
because in the end that's going to be
what's going to drive them the most yeah
having that classroom it's kind of
available twenty-four-seven even though
we don't want you know students to think
that they're expected to be there
twenty-four/seven having it always
available kind of means that things that
we usually have to put into the set
aside time for lectures can now just
happen organically over a much longer
period of time but the conception that
online education is very impersonal
doesn't come from nowhere no came from
some courses that are done the model
that makes it very difficult to feel
like you're connected so in theory we
have some students who are taking this
class who will go on to be instructors
for online classes or will go on to be
tas for other classes in the OMS yeah
what would you recommend to them for
when they're teaching classes in the
future making sure to foster the kind of
class that could develop this community
could develop this communication between
students right I think that's a really
good question um so I would take a look
at like what kind of environment you're
trying to set up and what incentives
like is so case in point like I remember
again when I was back in college like a
lot of times it was great on a curve and
so one thing that we noticed is that a
lot of
classes that were graded on curves
didn't really foster a lot of sense of
community because students felt that
they could feed it with each other
rather than wanting to help each other
out but in the end it kind of drew back
the ability to learn in general like I
felt like because you're so focused on
competitive you know scoring you're not
willing to take the time to really learn
from somebody else and you also want to
take a look into like you know what
motivates students like why are they in
the classroom in the first place like
what what passions they have that
they're driving them to take these
classes some things that I found when I
was going to classes was that
incentivizing collaboration with small
groups getting students to from the very
beginning have a voice about who they
are why their interests in taking this
class being able to connect with other
people so they could find mutual people
in the class that they want to interact
with and then from there give like help
them set up some kind of guiding rules
that will allow them to throughout the
course work with each other the things
that I've noticed is that you know when
professors allowed or instructors
allowed opportunity for students to kind
of play around and venture on their own
a little bit to really learn the
material on their own like really helped
a lot for me at least because sometimes
like you're going to want to prescribe a
lot of quizzes or homework assignments
and I think in many ways like when I had
classes that I didn't have to like every
week submit like a homework assignment
but rather take the time to really focus
on the problem set some quizzes and
concept that I felt that I really need
to study with and then stay with my
group Oh people from my study groups
allowed me to really thrive I think
sometimes homework could be more at
times it feels sometimes like you might
be just doing more work than actually
learning quality material that you feel
like you really need to focus on
homework I felt was something that you
were supposed to practice on but in the
end it was something that you were
graded for so like a lot of times it
didn't
the incentivize people to play around
and just kind of explore a little bit I
mean obviously like you can't expect
somebody to know something the first
time around like what is it to do a
linear regression or maybe like how to
add a whole bunch of variables together
if you're learning algebra for the first
time sometimes you just need to practice
that and sometimes students are going to
know what they should focus on as long
as you give them kind of ideas of how to
be self-sufficient learners so the last
component I would make is that if you
want really want to set up a good
learning environment it's not only just
collaboration and incentives but also
how to help students learn to be
self-directed learners like what are the
main ways that people learn and what
kind of incentives perform a habit over
time that students will want to develop
so that they could always learn new
concepts so it sounds like really what
we need to do is make sure we're leaving
room for students to collaborate we're
leaving room for students to learn from
failure and we're leaving room for
students to learn how to learn and those
are all things I think are very real to
the way we learn in the real world they
don't often me or don't always make it
into the classroom where we have a very
artificial learning environment but
generally it's very important to look at
how people learn naturally when they're
not in the classroom environment they're
not giving homework or quizzes or tests
or anything like that but they're just
out there learning from their
experiences and try and facilitate the
same kind of learning in the classroom
yeah so thank you so much for chatting
with me today and for your insights
thank you David for inviting me yeah
absolutely thank y'all thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
