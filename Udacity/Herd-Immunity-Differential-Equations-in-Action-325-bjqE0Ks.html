to learn about an important phenomenon
and that's herd immunity on the right
hand side of the AI equation the vector
AI appears in every term if we factor it
out this is what happens this helps us
to investigate what happens when a huge
percentage of all persons is vaccinated
we model vaccination by taking persons
from susceptible to recover which means
that the number of susceptible persons
decreases if the size of the population
stays constant when the number of
susceptible persons shrinks the first
term in the red parentheses decreases
and eventually if you vaccinate enough
people the complete expression is going
to become negative
if the rate of change is negative this
means that the number of infectious
persons is decreasing over the course of
time more susceptible people get
infected the number of susceptible
person decreases which means that this
first term gets even smaller which means
that the expression in the red
parentheses gets even more negative the
number of susceptible persons can only
decrease when enough people have been
vaccinated we can never have an epidemic
this is called herd immunity
not everybody is vaccinated but if the
number of people who are vaccinated is
large enough we can not have an epidemic
nonetheless</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
