part of the fraction great work if you
got all these correct if you made a
mistake that's okay too now it's a great
time to go back and look over your work
see if you can figure out how to get
these factors if not you can always
watch the solution for our first
numerator we can remove a 2x squared as
the greatest common factor this leaves
us with x squared plus 4x plus 3 for our
second factor now we can easily factor
this one by finding factors of 3 that's
sum to positive for that would be
positive 3 and positive 1 this is why
it's important to find a greatest common
factor first if we don't find this
greatest common factor we won't be able
to factor each of these and cancel our
factors in the end for this denominator
we have a coefficient of 1 in front of
the x squared term so we just want to
find factors of negative 15 that add 2
to this would be positive 5 and negative
3 for this numerator the greatest common
factor of the three terms is 1 so we
just want to find factors of negative 50
that sum to positive 5 the factors would
be negative 5 and positive 10 and then
we could use factoring by grouping to
get our factors of x + 5 + 2 X minus 5
for our last denominator we can remove a
common factor of 6 X from every single
term if we factor the 6x is the greatest
common factor we're left with 2x squared
plus 3x plus 1 if we distribute this
really quickly we can make sure that
this is correct when we look at
factoring this expression we want a
in factors of positive to that sum to
positive 3 we can use factoring by
grouping to arrive at the factors of X
plus 1 times 2x plus 1 these factors
take the place of this quadratic
trinomial now we're ready to simplify a
fraction since everything is in factored
form great work</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
