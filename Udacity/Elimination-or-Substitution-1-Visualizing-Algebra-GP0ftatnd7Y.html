slope-intercept form so it would be
pretty tough to use graphing we'd have
to do a lot of rearranging and then plot
points if we were graphing we could have
also made tables but that could take a
lot of work too so I'm going to take out
graphing if we want to use substitution
we need one of the equations solve for
one variable this one is almost solved
for X all I would need to do would be to
subtract 3 from both sides then I could
perform substitution so X could equal to
Y minus 3 and now I'd be ready to
substitute this in to my first equation
for x that's a pretty great choice if
you are leaning towards elimination you
might have thought to multiply the
second equation by negative 5 if we
distribute the negative 5 we would get
negative 15 minus 5x minus 10y now we
could add these equations together I
would want to switch the places of these
two terms so that way i could add my X
terms together more easily now I'm
actually ready to do elimination and I
would get negative 4y minus 15 equals
negative 10y plus 9 notice I can't
combine these because they're not like
terms this has a Y and this doesn't this
also has a Y and this doesn't this isn't
so great with elimination I'm having to
do a lot of steps and I'm having to
reorder a lot of terms so that's why I
think substitution is the best here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
