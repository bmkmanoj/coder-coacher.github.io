without any challenges recall that when
we talked about the many to one
multi-threading model we said that a
single blocking iya call that's coming
from one of the user level threads can
block the entire process although there
may be other user level threads that are
ready to execute a similar problem can
occur here as well if one of the
handlers issues a blocking higher call
to read data from the network or from
disk the entire event-driven process can
be blocked one way to circumvent this
problem is to use asynchronous i/o
operations a synchronous calls have the
property that when the system call is
made the kernel captures enough
information about the caller and where
and how the data should be returned once
it becomes available async calls also
provide the caller with an opportunity
to proceed executing something and then
come back at a later time to check if
the results of the asynch Rinna's
operation are already available for
instance the processor the thread can
come back later to check if a file has
already been read and the data is
available in a buffer in memory one
thing that makes a synchronous calls
possible is that the OS kernel is
multi-threaded so while the caller
thread continuous execution another
kernel thread does all the necessary
work and all the waiting that's needed
to perform the i/o operation to get the
ayodhya
and then to also make sure that the
results become available to the
appropriate user level context also
synchronous operations can benefit by
the actual IO devices for instance the
caller thread can simply pass some
request data structure to the device
itself and then the device performs the
operation in the thread at a later time
can come and check to see whether device
has completed the operation we will
return to a synchronous i/o operations
in a later lecture which you need to
know for now is that when we're using
asynchronous i/o operations our process
will not be blocked in the kernel when
performing I own in the event driven
model if the handler initiates an
asynchronous i/o operation for network
or for disk the operating system can
simply use the mechanism like select or
Paul or appalled that we mentioned
before
to catch such events so in summary
asynchronous IO operations said very
nicely with the event-driven model the
problem with asynchronous IO calls is
that they weren't ubiquitously available
in the past and even today they may not
be available for all types of devices in
a general case maybe the processing that
needs to be performed by our server
isn't to read data from a file where
there are asynchronous system calls but
instead may be to call processing on
some accelerator or some device that
only the server has access to to deal
with this problem vivek PI's paper
proposed the use of helpers when I am
learn needs to issue an eye operation
that can block it passes it to the
helper and returns to the event
dispatcher the helper will be the one
that will handle the blocking i/o
operation and interact with the
dispatcher as necessary the
communication with the helper can be via
a socket based interface or via another
type of messaging interface that's
available in operating systems called
pipes and both of these present a file
descriptor like interface so the same
kind of select or Paul mechanism that we
mentioned can be used for the event
dispatcher to keep track of various
events that are occurring in the system
this interface can be used to track
whether the helpers are providing any
kind of events to the event dispatcher
in doing this the synchronous iya call
is handled by the helper the helper will
be the one that will block and the main
event dispatcher in the main process
will continue uninterrupted so this way
although we don't have a synchronous iya
calls through the use of helpers we
achieved the same kind of behavior as if
we had asynchronous calls at the time of
the writing of the paper another
limitation was that not all kernels will
multi-threaded so basically not all
kernels support a de one-to-one model
that we talked about in order to deal
with this limitation the decision in the
paper was to make these helper entities
processes therefore they call
this model Ampat a symmetric
multiprocessing
event-driven model it's an event-driven
model it has multiple processes and
these processes are as symmetric the
helper ones only deal with blocking i/o
operation and then the main one performs
everything else in principle the same
kind of idea could have applied in a
multi-threaded scenario where the
helpers are threads not processes so all
symmetric multi-threaded event-driven
model and in fact there is a follow-on
on the flash work that actually does
this exact thing the anthat model the
key benefits of the asymmetric model
that we described is that it resolves
some of the limitations of the pure
event-driven model in terms of what is
required from the operating system the
dependence on asynchronous IO calls and
threading support in addition this model
lets us achieve concurrency with a
smaller memory footprint than either the
multi process or the multi-threading
model in the multiprocessor
multi-threading model a worker has to
perform everything for a full request so
it's memory requirements will be much
more significant than the memory
requirements of a helper entity in
addition with the ampere model we will
have a helper entity only for the number
of concurrent blocking i/o operations
whereas in the multi-threaded or multi
process models we will have as many
concurrent entities as many processes or
as many threads as there are actual
concurrent requests regardless of
whether they block or not the downside
is that old it works well with the
server type applications it is not
necessarily as generally applicable to
arbitrary applications in addition there
are also some complexities with the
routing of events in multi CPU systems</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
