selection in one of the earlier videos
in this lesson I told you about when I
was working with the email data that
there was a word that was effectively
serving as a signature on the emails and
I didn't initially realize it now the
mark of a good machine learner it
doesn't mean that they never make any
mistakes or that their features are
always perfect it means that they're on
the lookout for ways to check this and
to figure out if there is a bug in there
that they need to go in and fix so in
this case it would mean that there's a
type of signature word that we would
need to go in and remove in order for us
to to feel like we were being fair in
our supervised classification so this
was a really big learning experience for
me so I want to share it with you in
this mini project I'm going to sort of
take you into my head as I was trying to
figure out what was going on that I
couldn't over fit this decision tree and
how I figured out that there was one
feature or a couple features that were
responsible for that and then
specifically how I figured out what
words they were and how I removed them
so that's what you'll be doing in this
mini project</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
