design that is considering the system as
a whole possibly with respect to the
environment in which it's going to run
first item is architecture okay we've
already talked about non-functional
requirements and their effect on
architectural style second is how you're
going to deal with concurrency and
there's a spectrum of possibilities here
between having everything in a in a
single process to having one thread per
object physical design has to do with
how you're going to allocate tasks to
processors and deal with any peripheral
devices that are part of the system if
your application has a significant data
storage requirement you have to make us
some decision about whether you're going
to use a database to do that whether you
going to do files and how you're going
to deal with issues like lock locking
and protocols talking back and forth to
the data repository and the system what
is going to be the overall control
regime of your application okay is your
application going to be reactive such
such as would be the case with when you
have a GUI and the user is controlling
things with mouse clicks and and key
presses or is your application going to
be proactive that is it has its own it
has its own control in mind whereby it
calls the appropriate sub components in
order to accomplish whatever its goal is
and finally an important thing to
consider is how you're going to handle
errors and failures of various sorts
okay is there a recovery technique you
have in mind you're there error
reporting approaches you're going to
take with the user how you going to deal
with that overall problem</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
