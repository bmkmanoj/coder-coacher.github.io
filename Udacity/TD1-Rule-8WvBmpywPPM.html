where we can actually state the td1
update rule so it looks a little hairy
but we're gonna be able to go through it
and see that it does something very
sensible or at least somewhat sensible
so this is the the structure of the rule
of T d1 so for each time we start a new
episode we're gonna initialize this
thing called the eligibility e of s for
all the states to 0 so we just start
them off as ineligible at the start of
the episode and we start off our
estimate for the value function for this
episode to be initialized to whatever it
was at the end of the previous episode
that makes them so then each time we
take a step within the episode a step
from some s little t minus 1 to some
state s little T getting reward RT what
we're gonna do is first update the
eligibility of the state that we just
left then go through all the states
compute this one quantity which is the
same for all states this is the temporal
difference this is the difference
between or the sum of the reward plus
the discounted value of the state that
we just got to minus the state that we
just left and we're going to use the
values of the you know that we had from
the previous iteration previous episode
that's going to be our our temporal
difference and we're going to apply that
temporal difference to all states
proportional to the eligibility of those
states and of course the learning rate
because we don't want to move too much
and we're just going to update them by
that we're going to increase them by
this temporal difference times the
eligibility then we decrease or decay
the eligibility for for those states and
then we're back up to the next step ok I
it's got all the right letters so I
think I can imagine that this will do
something so the for all s part does
that have that has to be does it have to
be done in a specific order
no because the esses are all being done
in parallel here so the the value at
state s is going to be updated based on
this quantity which is the same for
everybody doesn't depend on which s
we're currently updating and this
quantity which is specific to the s that
we're looking at so it's all kind of
happening in parallel without any
dependencies between them yeah ok I see
so so because there's an order to the
states and the way we're gonna visit
them you basically get to see that value
kind of applied everywhere ok ok I think
I understand ok all right so let's sum
kind of step this through in a tiny
little example and then see the magic of
it see that it actually produces the
same outcome that we would have gotten
with the update rule that we had talked
about previously okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
