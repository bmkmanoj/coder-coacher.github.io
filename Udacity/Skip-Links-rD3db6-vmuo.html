management let me show you another
really useful technique on most websites
the main content is usually not the
first thing in the DOM instead we often
begin with navigation sub lists sidebars
hamburger menus and other bits of page
scaffolding this means that keyboard and
screen reader users must first navigate
through all this content before they can
get at the actual heart of the page for
users with motor impairments this is
especially frustrating a user who's
unable to move their arms might be
navigating the page with a switch device
which they activate by tapping their
head this user is just going to have to
tap over and over again to get through
all of these elements before they can
get to our content and that's not cool
thankfully there's an easy to implement
solution to this problem let's create a
hidden link that allows keyboard and
switch device users the ability to jump
straight to our page content these links
are often referred to as skip llings let
me show you an example so here we are on
the Funyun news site and I have some
navigation up here which normally the
keyboard user would have to tab through
instead when I press tab the first thing
I'm presented with is this little option
up here in the top of the corner which
is asking if I'd like to skip down to
the main content pressing inner will
then move focus down to the main content
area bypassing all of our navigation
implementing a skip link is actually
really easy I'll start by creating a
named anchor so the href of this anchor
refers to the ID of another element that
will have on the page I'm also going to
give this element a class of skip link
so i can refer to it in CSS later I want
the skip link to appear early in the Dom
so I'm going to put it before my
navigation to connect my skip link to my
main content I'll give my main element
an ID of main content which matches the
href value up here so these two are now
connected in newer versions of Chrome
and Firefox just doing this right here
will allow you to move focus down to the
main element when the skip link is
pressed
but for older browsers which don't move
focus when named anchors are clicked I'm
also going to want to add a tab index of
negative 1 over a my CSS I'll make sure
that the skip link has an absolute
position so it can appear in the top
left corner of the screen but I'm going
to make it initially positioned
off-screen by setting the top value to
negative 40 pixels then I can use the
focus pseudo-class to move the element
back on screen we'll talk more about the
focus pseudo class in a later lesson but
the short explanation is that this
pseudo class matches anytime the
corresponding element gains focus with
these simple techniques we've removed
the road blocks from the path of our
keyboard users and greatly improve their
experience if you're interested to learn
more about other techniques for creating
skip links I'll leave a link down in the
instructor notes to a webbing article
which covers them in more detail</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
