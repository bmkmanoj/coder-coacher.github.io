are the reviewers these are the people
responsible for raising the issues not
to say that the the moderator or the
recorder of the reader can't list some
issues but they're their primary focus
is going to be on their other on their
individual roles whereas the reviewers
the job here is to do exactly that to
review the artifact and to point out
raise raise issues typically a meeting
will have three to six reviewers fewer
run the risk of not having enough eyes
on a target and more can be overkill
that is not being effective as far as
the the time invested in and the number
of defects found reviewers should raise
issues by asking questions as opposed to
saying that's a problem they should not
explicitly suggest improvements but
rather ask if the author if the author
thought about doing things in an
alternative fashion the reviewers should
not blatantly assert defects but ask
what would happen under different
circumstances by taking a questioning
attitude the team can productively raise
issues without getting diverted by
emotionally driven debates</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
