quite common Python provides a better
way to do it and that's called width a
with statement looks like this we've got
a contacts card which is some expression
that evaluates to an object and we've
got some variable name and I'm not going
to go into all the details of how with
works there's more details on this
following the links below but as a
useful idiom for working with files what
we're going to do is use as our context
guard we're going to open the file this
is kind of like doing an assignment the
value that the name F out refers to will
be the result of this object but the big
difference is the wood statement
guarantees that this magic method for
exiting will be called on this object on
the object returned by the context card
and it guarantees that as long as this
execute and we enter the block that exit
will always be called for a file what
exit does this cleans up the file
including calling file close that means
we don't need to explicitly close the
file at all all we need to do is use
with so our code will look like this
we'll use with open opening the file and
assign it to the variable F out we can
do a bunch of stuff with it will write
to the file and then after the with
statement we can continue and we know
that this file will always be closed we
don't need to explicitly call close</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
