six graphs by the clustering coefficient
of the red node and the graphs would be
ordered from lowest clustering
coefficient the highest looking at the
six graphs we can see that C is a star
Network and star networks have a
clustering coefficient of zero so that
is the lowest clustering coefficient you
can see that D is a click which is a
clustering coefficient of one and so
that will be the highest clustering
coefficient both B and F have two edges
connecting the neighbors of the red node
so let's take a look at those two
intuitively since B has seven neighbors
and F has five B has a larger clique and
F has a smaller clique and since they
both only have two neighboring edges and
B has the larger clique and actually
calculating the clustering coefficient
we can see that yes B is smaller than F
for a the degree of the red node is five
and there are five links between the
neighbors so we get a clustering
coefficient of a half and for E degree
of the red node is seven and there are
seven links between its neighbors so the
clustering coefficient is one third so a
final answer is c bfe7 yoj</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
