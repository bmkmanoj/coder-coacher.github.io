a technology program manager at Google
at Google I work on making sure that the
products we create are accessible to the
audience of our diverse users regardless
of their ability or impairment modern
web technologies make it very easy for a
developer to create a website that's
difficult for someone who is blind to
use if a user has no vision it's quite
likely they would be using a screen
reader which is a software that allows
them to hear the information displayed
on the screen via a text-to-speech
synthesizer they may also be using
Braille which allows them to feel the
on-screen text with their fingers when
using Braille display many websites are
visual in their nature and lack keyboard
navigation which is essential for blind
people to be able to navigate through
the content in general it is safe to
assume that there are more people with
visual impairments that is people who
have some sight as opposed to people who
are completely blind there are also
people with low visual acuity and they
may be used in large print text or
magnification when using the computer
for example my friend Laura uses
magnification with text-to-speech as
well as various color contrast options
and I haven't mentioned people with poor
color vision who have may have
difficulty distinguishing red and green
or blue and yellow this accounts for 9%
of male and 1% of female we may also
find ourselves with temporary challenges
such as when trying to use a computer in
the Sun or looking at a dodgy projector
whenever accessibility comes up in a
conversation people tend to picture
someone who is blind like myself but
there are actually more impairments to
think about and consider there is a huge
number of people with a motor or
dexterity impairments such users may be
using only the keyboard head or eye
tracking software switches voice
dictation etc someone may have a broken
wrist broken trackpad or simply right in
a shaky train by catering to users with
permanent dexterity impairments we
ensure great experience for everyone
there are also users with hearing
impairments for example some may be
completely deaf yet others have some
hearing the content that uses sound
should provide some kind of visual
alternative for example a messenger app
could be using a flash an alert as well
as some notifications there are also
users with cognitive impairments for
example a DD dyslexia or autism these
users may require diverse accommodations
such as zooming the screen to make it
easier to read the content or minimal
design to minimize distraction and
cognitive load we can all probably
relate to feeling stressful or cognitive
load so improving experience for users
with cognitive impairments makes it so
much better experience for everybody
else
in summary accessibility is really about
making sure that the content and the
websites we create is useable to people
with various impairments or abilities</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
