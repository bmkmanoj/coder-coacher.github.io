said that's only one of the ways in
which you can do authentication let's
look at some of the other ways in which
authentication can be done so the other
one second one was something you have
the token or a smart card or something
like that obviously if it's something
you have then you must have it on them
if you don't have your token or your
smart card or your smartphone if that's
been used as there's something you have
you can't obviously access the system
and people sometimes forget these things
and don't have them on them when they
need to access especially banks when
they give you these tokens or send you
some sort of a code through them if you
don't have that with you you're not
going to be able to access your account
so not having them would would cause a
problem so you do have to have them that
that's one of the requirements when you
use this method so obviously it is
something that you must have it should
be able to talk to the system or the
human has to enter the pin or whatever
code that is sent to them but if it's a
smart card the smart card has to talk to
the system which requires you have to
have a reader for example you should be
able to swipe the smart card and it
should be able to communicate so that
adds the hardware requirement which
increases costs even if you have it at
the other end they should have a reader
if they don't have it then you can't use
it with that system how is
authentication implemented with
something you have if you have a smart
card which is talking about that can
talk to the system then there could be
some sort of a challenge response kind
of a thing so the system can say if you
really belong to the user that is being
claimed or claim is made being made
about the identity of a certain user
then you that users smart card has a
certain secret use that secret to sort
of maybe respond to my challenge encrypt
it or something like that or do
something to this challenge the response
should demonstrate that the secret that
is stored in this smart card is the one
that is used to generate the response so
sometimes if you have some processing
the smart card the smart card can do
this sort of computation generate a
response that could be sent so on this
pin and chip kind of cards the chip can
do this kind of
and that's how this would be implemented
the the problem with this is that there
is added cost and of course sometimes
they could be misplaced trust in these
kind of tokens or cards that we're
talking about for something you have is
of course the very well known case of
the RSA breach or where the master key
was compromised and as a result of that
all the securid tokens that are essays
stronger authentication relied on you
can't count on doing correct
authentication using those and so
there's added cost we are talking about
but there's also vulnerabilities or
attacks that can limit the strength that
authentication the stronger
authentication that these kind of tokens
provide so something you have you don't
need to remember those complex passwords
you're talking about but we need to be
aware of the fact and that they have
their own set of problems</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
