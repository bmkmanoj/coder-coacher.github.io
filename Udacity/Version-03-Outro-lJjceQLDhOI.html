really long time to get back oh are you
okay oh I'll be okay Walter would what
happened to you well after my normal
wrist workout routine I was trying to
organize my shopping list for the big
benefit but now that we've got about 20
users it's been much harder to find my
lists I just had to keep scrolling and
scrolling and scrolling oh it's okay I
did out well then a bunch of users who
didn't even have anything to do with the
benefit started adding a bunch of items
maybe they were confused or maybe they
were bored and just trying to find
someone to torment in any case I had to
delete each item one by one then I had
to go in and manually add 50 items my
wrist started hurting and I type through
the pain God you see is in pain we could
celebrate um I'm sorry Walter you know
this actually is sounding like a
something we have to add a way for users
to kind of limit who can see and edit
items on their shopping lists yeah and
some sort of sorting functionality might
not be bad idea either when I with
firebase queries we could tackle the
sorting functionality sharing might be a
bit more difficult we'd have to think
about designing the database as the user
base grows we could look at that in
version 0.4 yeah that sounds like a
great idea okay looking at that right
now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
