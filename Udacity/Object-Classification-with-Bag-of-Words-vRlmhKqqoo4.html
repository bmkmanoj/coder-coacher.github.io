classification we said you know nearest
neighbor has some power but it can be
kind of expensive in terms of storage
and access and maybe there are better
ways we can do things and in fact we
talked about training classifiers so we
talked about boosting or SVM so we can
do that for this example too right I
have a whole bunch of images of violins
I've got a whole bunch of images of
people I've got a whole bunch of images
of planes I take all those images
together I find all the visual words
right that gives me a vocabulary I can
build a histogram for each of the
objects and you know so I bought a bunch
of training data so I got a bunch of
histograms for planes at histograms for
cars histograms for faces and what do I
do
I just train a support vector machine to
make the decision you know is this a
person to play in a car etc and in fact
that's exactly what was done this work
comes from o4 there was a database still
as a database referred to as the Caltech
101 it was one of the original data sets
of enough images of enough object types
to start to explore this notion of
database access and and what they were
doing was they trained exactly a linear
SVM we talked about those before using a
bag of words on vectors and there are a
couple of different classes faces
airplanes cars motorbikes etc and what's
being reported here is that for each of
the actual faces you know out of you
know the average percentage of time that
it was the best rank was 94 96 nights so
you can see that it's pretty good and
then the other thing that they report is
the mean rank so when I try to find you
know whether or not you know when I show
a plane and I say well do I think it's a
plane do I think it's a face do I think
it's a motorbike etc you know how what
is the average ranking of the correct
answer and you can see the values 1.0
something meaning that it almost always
got the answer right but it was just an
example of this bag-of-words approach
that says I don't know anything about
parts I don't know anything about
structure what I know about is images
and I take locations and images and I
find interesting points I build some
description give me a word like
collection of those descriptors and then
for any new image
find the descriptors that are present
and that's what's referred to as bag of
words</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
