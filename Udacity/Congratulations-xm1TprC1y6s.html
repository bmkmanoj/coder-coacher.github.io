up it sounds the jungle let me go over
to that tree okay JP that's better so
how are you in the developer doing
besides all the craziness with launching
point 5 pretty good I submitted shopping
list + + to the abbeys like you
suggested we're a bit of a long shot
with grocery grabber having just
released the next version but you know
you never know that's awesome and let's
see besides that well we finish
everything on the wireframes woohoo
that's great to hear why don't you take
me through everything you guys have done
for all time sing sure thing shopping
list + + is turning it into a
fully-fledged experience as all thanks
to you the developer starting with
version 0.1 you made a very basic
prototype that just read and wrote sub
data in version 0.2 you flush this out
more by incorporating firebase UI so
that you can list out shopping lists and
shopping list items in version 0.3 you
added user accounts as well as a bunch
of functionality like letting others
know that you're in the store shopping
and marking that you've bought items
version 0.4 might have been our most
trying moment when you overhauled the
data structure to allow for shopping
list sharing
you also added some pretty snazzy
sorting features in version 0.5 you add
an offline functionality so that the app
cache is data even when it's not on the
screen also implemented a bunch of read
write and validation rules to make sure
that our data is properly formed and
that only the correct people have access
to it nice so I got to ask what about
that big security flaw you talked about
well for the short term I basically got
another engineer to separate our
password and email flow but we'll be
looking into incorporating a simplistic
server may be no later for oh hey
curried Walter here and they want to say
hi ogp um my friend hey hey guys great
to see all of you actually I might need
to sign off I don't like the way that
parakeet is looking at me ok bye bye
have fun well that was an informative
blast from the somewhat recent past I
can't believe that just three months ago
I was sitting out of meetings with a Bay
Area Shepherds group you've come a long
way and you've come a long way to you
now know how to read data into firebase
you also know how to take that data and
display it in real time and if I brace
out let's not forget users you also know
how to create authentication methods for
email and another provider such as
Google and you've learned how to create
fire based data schemas to avoid things
like nesting data while also d
normalizing your data this really helps
you grow and scale your apps you've also
learned how to filter and sort your data
finally we learned how to use fire bases
security rules language to make our apt
status a cure that's a lot that is a lot
you know what I feel like you deserve
this Abbey as much as I do you look more
than a cell phone duct tape to a cheap
trophy we hope you feel empowered to
create your own apps and firebase
actually that reminds me I have another
venture that I wanted to talk to you
about and I could actually send over the
spec right after we all take a
well-deserved rest so yeah let's go
ahead and do that speaking of which
alters taking forever with that in
Street oh yeah where is he where is he
where is he where is he
where is he where is he where is he
where is he</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
