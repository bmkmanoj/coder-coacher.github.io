engineer was born and we saw some of the
problems that led to the birth of
software engineering let's see how can
we can do better how can we perform
software development in a smarter in a
better way in a more successful way so
what I'm going to show here is the way I
see software development to me software
development is fundamentally going from
an abstract idea in somebody's head for
example the customers head to a concrete
system that actually implements that
idea and hopefully it does it in the
right way and this is a very complex
process it can be overwhelming so unless
we are talking about the trivial system
it's very complex for us to keep in mind
all the different aspects of the systems
and to do all the different steps
required to build the system
automatically so that's when software
processes come to the rescue
so what is the software process a
software process nothing else at the way
of breaking down this otherwise
unmanageable task into smaller steps in
smaller steps that we can handle and
they can be tackled individually so
having a software process is of
fundamental importance for several
reasons
first of all for non-trivial systems you
can just do it by getting it by just
sitting down and developing what you
have to do instead is to break down the
complexity in a systematic way so
software processes are normally
systematic and you need to break down
this complexity in a more or less formal
way so software processes are also a
formal or semi-formal way of discussing
or describing how software should be
developed so what are the steps involved
in developing software</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
