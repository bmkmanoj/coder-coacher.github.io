it's an exciting time in this story thus
far we have already completed lexing and
parsing but remember that our goal was
ultimately to make a web browser so
let's see how things are going towards
that goal we're going to start with your
average web page a string of HTML with
some embedded JavaScript and we wanted
to break it down into tokens or words
and that process is called lexical
analysis once we have a bunch of tokens
we were going to parse those into a tree
like one of these trees and that
approach is called syntactic analysis or
just parsing and now we want to walk
that tree and understand it and do
useful work and this is called either
semantics a fancy word for meaning or
interpreting so we went to look at this
abstract syntax tree that has five and
three as a child of plus and say that
means eight we want to do this for web
pages and the meaning that we're going
to extract from them is what they look
