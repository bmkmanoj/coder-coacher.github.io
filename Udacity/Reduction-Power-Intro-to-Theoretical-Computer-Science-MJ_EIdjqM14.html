parameter tractable problems and there
are a lot of neat things about these
first the exponential part of the
running time is restricted to the
parameter K rather than the parameter n
and at least inul in many cases k is
much less than n another neat thing is
that they provably allow for some very
effective pre-processing rules the
details of some of these are a little
bit out of scope for this course but we
can get a bit of a taste for them by
looking at vertex cover and noticing a
few key insights now let's say we have a
graph G and suppose it has n vertices
along with parameter K now what I'd like
to know is does G have a vertex cover of
size at most K so in other words we're
discussing the decision variant of the
vertex cover problem another way of
saying this is that at most a certain
number of vertices are needed to cover
all the edges and this could be either k
minus 1 k 2 k k plus n or n another fact
that this question or the answer to this
question will imply is that if any
vertex is an end point to a certain
number of edges or more then it must be
in the cover and this could be either k
minus 1 k k plus 1 2 K or K squared
edges so for both of these questions
please check whichever one is most
appropriate</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
