simplifying important think about a
plane catching fire as it leaves the
runway you think about how could that
possibly have occurred you want to
figure out what the cause of the failure
is and in order to explain how the
failure came to be you want to come up
with a minimum of factors that explain
though so here is our plane with
passengers luggage on board
entertainment system air conditioned and
what not now suppose you had a means to
turn back time and repeat history at
will or suppose all of this were running
in a simulation and you could try again
and again to see whether the failure
occurs on earth then you could try to
simplify things you could for instance
remove the passengers and see where the
failure still occurs Oh still occurs
remove the flight attendant and see
whether the failure still occurs well
plane still catches fire remove the
seats plane still catches fire remove
the air conditioned system repeat the
whole thing and remove the entertainment
system remove the luggage and you see it
none of this actually is important
whatever you remove the plane still
catches fire you can go and remove the
airport and even with all the airport
removed everything happens as before but
as soon as you remove this little metal
strip that's lying on the runway then
all of a sudden your plane takes off
just as normal but if that strap is
there then your plane is on fire what
we're going to explore today is how to
simplify failures that is finding what
is relevant for the failure and what is
not and how to do this automatically
that is automatically finding out the
cause of the failure</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
