want to put a skin over his frame to
make him look more lifelike and
infiltrate the humans become more
accepted by humanity a robot model
typically has a few rigid elements that
do not change over time such as a
forearm and an upper arm at the joint
the objects are currently separate
that's where you'd like to put skin one
simple solution is to just put some
triangles connecting the two rigid
pieces sort of like a cylinder as the
joint bends these triangles deform and
stretch keeping the two arm pieces
attached this doesn't look very good as
the more the arm bends the more the
joint flattens out what we'd prefer is
something more like a flexible tube that
bends but mostly keeps its shape say we
now add such a joint with three
cylinders one after the other the
challenge now is to how to move the
cylinder vertices as the joint bends the
basic solution is surprisingly simple
each vertex is assigned a weight this
weight is how much each rigid parts
position affects the vertex the top and
bottom of the tube still stays connected
to its rigid body part so that body
parts influence has a weight of 14
vertices closer to the forearm the way
to say two-thirds forearm one-thirds
upper arm this modeling process of
adding polygons and assigning weights is
called skinning or sometimes vertex
blending the rigid parts of the model
are defined by bones these bones are
like a skeleton so this whole area
sometimes called skeletal animation as a
bone moves the skin is influenced by the
bones transform times its weight
specifically let's look at this one
vertex on the skin that's near the
forearm the vertex location is
transformed twice once with respect to
the forearm and once with respect to the
Emperor are these two transformed
locations are then multiplied by their
corresponding weights giving the
interpolated point between them the
basic algorithm works fairly well but
can have problems for example in the
inner part of the elbow the points may
bend in words in an unconvincing way in
practice a vertex can be influenced by
more than two bones the bones and
weights are something the person
modeling decides and the weights always
add up to one these characters were
exported from valves Team Fortress 2
game and animated with three jss
skinning class called skinned mesh
skinning is well suited to the GPU as
the vertex shader can transform points
multiple times and add together the
weighted locations there are more
elaborate algorithms that give better
results but for interactive rendering in
particular skinning is the mainstay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
