had a lot of great questions on the
forums before we get into those I think
you wanted to mention something about
memcache that yeah we're worried that
you weren't too clear on sure yeah
somebody asked me a question IRC this
morning that made me think there's
there's a 10 second piece of advice I
can give you that'll make the homework
for unit 6 actually a lot easier which
you should be working on right about now
I think we were using memcache basically
to store strings and integers so in your
code you know you can say something like
memcache that set I realize I was
writing this up I'm trained not to speak
while I'm writing so they can edit it
any way you can say memcache that set
and then you give it a key you know
which just be a string it's it's always
a string that's the memcache protocol
and in the memcache protocol it says the
value has to be a string as well however
we're using this library this Python
memcache library that Google provides
and most Python memcache libraries have
this a behavior which is you can put
just about anything as the value so the
value can be you know another string it
can also be you know just an integer or
can even be a Python data structure you
know you can give it a little dictionary
you can give it a little you know what
might be useful in the homework you'll
find would be a couple with maybe a
timestamp and another string something
like that perhaps we'll see but you know
you can store this you know you can
store this value and then when you get
the value back out of memcache the
library will we'll take the the encoded
string and convert it back into your
Python data structure so as long as
there's simple things in here and by
simple things I basically mean lists
dictionaries primitive data types you
can get away with some objects but they
have to be pickable that's the Python
library they're using called pickle
which converts a Python object into a
string most simple objects will work as
well everything we do in this class
should be memcache table without any
trouble data store entities can be
memcached with no trouble so you can
actually store whatever you want in here
so that should help with homework
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
