impressed you're getting very good at
this so why don't you go while then
continue there anything else you think
we can improve here
well something something was bothering
me that what happens if there's more
than one book with the same title and
somebody puts in a request oh I see
that's a good point
so basically what you're telling me is
there's kind of a difference between an
item and the title so the title is kind
of a more general concept in a sense so
for you can have multiple copies of a
given title is that right yeah we have
five copies of Tom Sawyer and the
person's the patrons really putting in a
request for any Sawyer they don't want
like copy number three of them so I
write the one they want to read on
Sawyer okay and I can represent that so
in the way in which I suggest we do that
and you can tell me whether it makes
sense to you is by introducing an
additional class which I call title and
that represents exactly the concept that
you're mentioning so this is a title
with represented some specific content
that is not related to a specific
physical element I can be related to
multiple physical elements so basically
I'm going to create this title and then
I'm gonna create a relationship between
the title and the item and what the
relationship is telling me the the
association between these two in this
case is an association that we don't we
call aggregation so the special kind of
Association that basically indicates
that an item of this type so a title can
consist of multiple elements of this
type of multiple item so it's telling me
that one title can consist of multiple
items and I'm going to indicate it with
this annotation which is a this diamond
at the top of the of the Association and
so and so we can we can move our request
line up from loanable item to title
because that's what they're really
requests definitely definitely and in
fact you know that represents exactly
the situation that you were mentioning
at this point when the patron makes a
request it makes a request to a title
and not to a learnable item and then and
then when the actual
lon will take place then that would be
connected to a specific item right okay
that makes sense make sense okay good</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
