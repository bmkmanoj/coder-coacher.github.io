be negative infinity to negative 3 Union
2 to positive infinity great solving if
you found those two regions when we find
the solution set for a quadratic
inequality we first want to start by
finding the zeros these are the X values
that make the equation equal to zero we
factor this quadratic using X plus 3
times X minus 2 as the factors then we
set each factor equal to zero to get x
equals negative 3 and x equals positive
2 we use these X values to set up our
three intervals so we know the values of
x might be less than negative 3 between
negative 3 and 2 or greater than to
these different regions are the possible
solutions to our inequality we test the
value in the first interval to see if it
makes the inequality true I'm going to
choose the value x equals negative for
plugging in negative 4 for x we'll get 6
is greater than 0 which we know is a
true statement this means any value less
than negative 3 will make this
inequality true and notice we've already
got our first interval negative infinity
to negative 3 here we need to test a
value now for interval 2 i'll use x
equals 0 since that's pretty easy to
plug in and evaluate if x is equal to 0
then these two terms would drop out they
would just be 0 and we'd be left with
negative 6 is greater than 0 we know
this statement is not true so this
region is false we exclude it from our
solution set and finally we try a
different value of x for a third
interval I'll use x equals 3 when we
plug in x equals 3 here and here we'll
get the statement 6 is greater than 0
this is true this means any value
greater than 2 will satisfy our original
inequality and notice we have our second
region from to all the way up to
positive infinity</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
