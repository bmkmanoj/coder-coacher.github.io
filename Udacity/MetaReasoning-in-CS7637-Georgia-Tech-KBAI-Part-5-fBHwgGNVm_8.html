possible meta reasoning has actually
been a motivating pedagogical goal for
the design of this very course you'll
notice that for almost every lesson
we've started with an example of a
problem that you could solve an
incremental concept learning for example
we start by giving you several examples
of foods and not foods and then we asked
you is this a foo in production systems
we gave you some information about a
baseball game and asked you to decide
what the picture should do next in
learning by recording cases we gave you
a world of rectangles and asked you to
decide what color a new rectangle might
be in classification we gave you a bunch
of pictures and asked you to decide
which of those pictures were birds in
planning we gave you our blocks
microworld asked you to develop a plan
to go from our initial state to our goal
state in each of these we've started
with a problem that we could solve that
we then wanted to design an agent to
solve these examples then motivated our
discussion not necessarily of how we did
it but how we could design an agent to
do it then at the end of each lesson we
revisited that example we took the
reasoning method that we designed for
our agent and looked at how that exact
reasoning method would allow it to
answer the same example with which we
started the lesson when you did the
example at the start of the lesson you
didn't necessarily know how you were
able to solve that problem you could
speculate but you never know for sure
but then by building an agent that can
solve that problem we start to gain some
understanding for the processes that we
must be able to engage in in order to
solve that problem as well so by
designing the agent we develop a greater
understanding of our own cognition so in
this way the very design of the lessons
in this course has been driven by trying
to develop metacognition in you in fact
developing metacognition and students is
the entire goal of my own PhD
