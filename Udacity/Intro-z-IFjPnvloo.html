lesson is gonna start a whole unit on
motion now in the real world things
really move you know when trees blow in
the wind boats move along the water a
baseball player swings his bat and
typically misses if he would if he plays
for the Mets but you know things are
moving all the time and our perception
system handles them in computer vision
we also want to deal with motion but
what's kind of cool is actually nothing
is moving what you're seeing here is a
repeated gif image and I've I've made it
sort of coarsely sampled actually from
some slides stolen from some folks
listed below so that you can see that
it's actually a sequence of static
frames okay and you know of course the
issue is that when we look at them when
they're not so separate in time by quite
so much we see this nice motion and what
we would like is that the same
perception of motion that we have we'd
like to be able to give a machine we'd
like a machine to be able to understand
the notion of motion if you will so when
we're going to talk about motion here
we're gonna start talking about video
now really we're just thinking about a
sequence of frames and in fact a long
time ago we used to just call them
sequences because a camera would go and
then a camera would take another picture
and then sometime later would take
another picture another picture and the
question was how to use those these days
of course much more ubiquitous is a
notion of video where a sequence is
captured over time usually relatively
quickly so things can't change a whole
lot from one sequence sample to the next
and usually taking it regular intervals
whether it's every thirty Hertz 60 Hertz
24 hours the idea is that it's at
regular intervals now our image is no
longer a function of just space X and y
but our image is a function of space X Y
and time T so our signal is I of X Y and
T but as I said before sometimes when we
describe them as a three-dimensional
function like this we tend to think of
that all three dimensions as being the
same but they're not space is quite
different than time so if I wearing a
nice checkered shirt instead of this
gorgeous green as I moved in space you
would see pixels changing very quickly
in terms of their intensity of their
color but if I were to change the pixels
that quickly in time you would
essentially see a mess you would see all
this flickering and things changing very
rapidly so in general even though we
think of these as a three dimensional
function remember that time and space
are different in terms of their
statistics</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
