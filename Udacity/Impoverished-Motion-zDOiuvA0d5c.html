moving lights so I'm showing you this
picture and you probably don't see very
much so you probably don't know what
this is to me it's obviously a horse
jumping over a fence except when I put
it in motion
oh it's Megan's strolling along it has
such a nice stroll no it's not just some
set around that's from some other
exhibit notice that that center point is
fixed it's not moving at all and in fact
if I erase that and you look at that and
you just stare at that point the whole
thing looks kind of weird but then if
you just stop looking at that point just
look at the whole thing you see somebody
moving except now I can't get that weird
center point out of my head all right
but the idea is that with this very
impoverished stimulus you are able to
perceive not just motion remember
nothing is moving here right there are
no points moving on the screen point
point point you see them moving not only
do you see points moving you see a
person moving all there are are static
pictures of points that's all that's
there the rest of what's going on is
being manufactured in your head and our
goal because we're computational vision
people is to think a little bit about
how to get the computer to manufacture
some of that information</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
