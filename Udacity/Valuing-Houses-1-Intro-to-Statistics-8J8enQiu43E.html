people studying statistics has to do
with purchasing decisions suppose you
wish to buy a house they are small
houses and big houses but you really
like this one special house built by a
famous designer and this house has a
certain price say in u.s. dollars is
ninety two thousand dollars so the
question you'd like to ask yourself is
this okay is it too much and you should
pay less or too little so let's go and
find out
in statistics the way we find out is by
looking at data so let's assume there's
a database of previous house sales of
homes in the same neighborhood and just
for simplicity let's assume we know
about two things the size of a home and
the cost average of assault there's a
house with a thousand phone at square
feet that so did a hundred twelve
thousand dollars a much larger one with
two thousand four not square feet sold
$492,000 and so on for an entire number
of other houses so now it's a statistics
problem you have past data and here's
your very first quiz say the house you
wish to purchase has a thousand three
hundred square foot in size how much
money should you expect to pay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
