more compartments than the one before a
model for heat conduction in via let's
draw imaginary lines after each
millimeter of that wire and treat each
millimeter as one compartment every
single compartment is treated in the
same way so we can just look at one
single of them to get an idea of what's
happening let's take number eight
compartment number eight losses a
specific percentage of its energy per
time two compartments number 7 and
number nine to be specific let's say
it's going to lose one percent per
millisecond to the left and one percent
per millisecond to the right but they
will also an energy flow from
compartment number 72 number eight with
the same percentage of the energy of
number seven and there will be an energy
flow from compartment number 92
compartment number eight again the same
percentage but but of the energy content
of compartment number nine so after a
short amount H of time the temperature
of the compartment number eight will be
its initial temperature plus that amount
of time x one percent per millisecond to
be gaining one percent per millisecond
from compartment number seven and fear
gaining one percent per millisecond from
compartment number nine but we are
losing one percent per millisecond to
the left and to the right so we're
losing twice that percentage one final
thing to be doing to clean things up a
little let's get rid of this one percent
per millisecond here if we work with
seconds instead one second amounts to
1,000 milliseconds so we need 1,000
percent per second one thousand percent
is 10 so now we have an equation for the
temperature of the compartment number
eight after one time step of course this
works similarly for all other
compartments you just change the numbers
it's about the left neighbor the right
neighbor and ourselves</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
