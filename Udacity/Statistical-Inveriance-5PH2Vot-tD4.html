and you want your network to say it's an
image with a cat in it it doesn't really
matter whether cat is it's still an
image with a cat if your network has to
learn about kittens in the left corner
and about kittens in the right corner
independently that's a lot of work that
he has to do how about you telling it
instead explicitly that objects in
images are largely the same whether
they're on the left or on the right of
the picture that's what's called
translation invariance different
positions same kitten yet another
example imagine you have a long text
that talks about kittens does the
meaning of kitten change depending on
whether it's in the first sentence or in
the second one mostly not so if you
train a network on text maybe you want
the part of the network that learns what
a kitten is to be reused every time you
see the word kitten and not have to
relearn it every time the way you
achieve this in neural networks is using
what's called weight sharing when you
know that two inputs can contain the
same kind of information and you share
their weights and train the way it's
jointly for those inputs it's a very
important idea statistical invariance
things that don't change on average
across time or space are everywhere for
images the idea of weight sharing will
get us to study convolutional networks
for text and sequences in general it
will lead us to embeddings and recurrent
neural networks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
