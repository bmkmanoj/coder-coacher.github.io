had students in Japan and in the u.s.
being shown medical procedure films and
these were really disgusting films arms
being amputated burn grafts and so on
now as it turns out they saw the films
in one of two different conditions
though either alone or in the presence
of an authority figure now in the u.s.
it didn't matter whether the students
saw the film alone or the presence of an
authority figure the students showed
real signs of disgust in either
condition but in Japan it was only when
they saw the film alone did the students
show the disgust face because in Japan
there's a rule a cultural norm that
prohibits disgust expressions in the
presence of an authority figure so
instead of that they mask that disgust
with a smile interestingly these smiles
were not genuine smiles because they
didn't involve the eyes so this is a
good example of how culture influences
and dictates when it's okay to express
which emotion so what about gender and
emotion of course the stereotype is that
women are more emotional than men now
the question is is there any evidence
for this stereotype well yes and no so
as it turns out men and women express
emotion very similarly although women do
in fact smile a little bit more but
women do seem to have an advantage in
two areas first when talking about
emotion they're more precise than men
men seem to be a little bit more vague
and secondly women are better at reading
emotion on people's faces and hearing it
in their voices</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
