this guy than him a 12-volt car battery
certainly scares me more than a 1.5 as
TNT seems like it's gonna do a lot more
damage in its explosion than this will
as it burns and this is certainly more
intimidating than this now it's not
always the case that what's more
frightening has greater potential energy
but in each of these situations
potential energy could somehow be
converted into kinetic energy
if this frock were to fall it would gain
motion speed as it fell to the ground
if this dynamite were to explode the
shards would go flying off in all
directions
if this bow were released the arrow
would fly through the air high-speed
this one's a little harder to see but if
I were to connect the wire between these
two terminals we'd actually get the
motion of what's called electrons
through the wire likewise here but more
motion here this idea of energy
transforming between potential energy
and kinetic energy and even back again
is one that is fundamental to physics
and I hope that by the end of this unit
you'll be seeing everyday occurrences in
terms of their energy transformations
now all these cases exhibited a
different type of potential energy this
we would call gravitational potential
energy burning and combustion and
explosion is an example of chemical
potential energy as is a battery and a
bow and arrow is an example elastic
potential energy in this unit we're
going to focus on making calculations
with gravitational potential energy and
the problems that we'll even talk about
elastic keep watching to learn how to
use this incredible physics tool</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
