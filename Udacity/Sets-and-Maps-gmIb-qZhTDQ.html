structure to the mix before we dive into
maps I want to introduce one new concept
quickly a set is another one of these
broad abstract concepts it's comparable
to a list it's also vaguely a collection
of things but with one big difference a
list has some kind of ordering for its
elements a set doesn't have that but
instead doesn't allow for repeated
elements you can think of a set kind of
like a bag you can reach in and pull
something out but you'll never know what
order you're getting the elements out in
a map is a set based data structure kind
of like an array is a list based data
structure the keys in a map are a set I
know that's a lot of new terminology but
let's look at exactly what that means
the keys of a map like the words in a
dictionary need to be unique you can
have several definitions for the same
word stored in the value but if you had
the same word in the dictionary many
times you would randomly pick out a
definition when you were first looking
thus each key only exists once in a map
and a group of these unique keys without
any order is called a set so what are
maps useful for other than dictionaries
you can use a map for a lot of things
that have unique names for example maybe
you have a bunch of information about
Udacity courses you could store each
course ID as a key and use that to look
up more detailed information as values</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
