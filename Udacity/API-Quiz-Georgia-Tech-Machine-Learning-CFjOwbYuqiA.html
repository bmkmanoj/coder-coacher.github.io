and use it to take turn transitions into
a model but once we have a model you
already told us last time how we can use
a planner to spit out of palsy you
didn't talk about those planners what
are what's the name of the algorithms
that you described last time value
iteration and policy iteration yes right
so so what you can do is run either of
those algorithms in here they both have
the same API right they both take models
and spit out policies true all right so
so let's do this as a quiz we'll say
let's use your idea of mapping
transitions to model to policy and what
would you call this whole box right so
as a whole box it takes transitions in
and produces policy out so it is solving
the reinforcement learning problem but
it's taking a very particular approach
to it but let's contrast it with it with
kind of the opposite idea which is we
can also map a model through a simulator
into transitions and then if we have the
ability to do reinforcement learning we
can use turn those transitions into a
policy so again as a composed system
this is turning a model into a policy so
it is a kind of planner but it's a
planner that uses a learner inside and
this is a learner that uses a planner
inside so just as just out of curiosity
I would like to just ask people what
they'd want to call these I'm not gonna
grade these but I just just interested
like what would you call this approach
is that make sense just type it in the
box let's pretend it make sense all
right go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
