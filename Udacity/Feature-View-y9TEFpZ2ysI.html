but I think that there are some other
views which are sometimes useful in
understanding or conveying your
understanding of a system that you're
trying to build at the architectural
level one that I've found quite useful
is a feature view a feature is a
conceptual unit of system behavior from
the users point of view your camera has
a zooming feature available to it or
maybe it doesn't ok typically features
or something which manufacturers provide
as options that you may have to pay
extra for feature modeling is used for
describing a set of features that a
collection of related applications
provide there's a feature diagram which
i'm going to show you in a second that
conveys the set of possible features
that might be configured into a
particular product in that set of
products the diagram is graphical it has
icons and so on but it can also have
inter feature constraints which aren't
shown in this particular diagram here's
a particular feature diagram showing the
features of a car at the top is the
what's called the concept or the main
manufactured item and then under it are
its features so the car this particular
car has four features ok three of the
features are required the body the
transmission and engine and whether or
not it pulls trailer is optional whether
it's required or optional is indicated
by a little circle at the end of the arc
connecting car to its features if the
circle is filled in it's a required
feature and if it's open then it's an
optional feature features can
sub features so transition sorry a
transmission can have an automatic
transmission feature or a manual
transmission feature the or that I just
said is indicated by that open arc
connecting the two lines coming out of
the transition similarly there are two
kinds of engines electrical and gasoline
in this case the arc is filled in though
indicating that you can have a
combination that is you could have a
hybrid engine we could imagine a
constraint here going between automatic
transmission and pulls trailer saying
that the poles trailer option is only
available if you have the automatic
transmission and not the manual
transmission</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
