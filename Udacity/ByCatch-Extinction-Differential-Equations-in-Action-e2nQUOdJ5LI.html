first problem we know that in order to
use the forward Euler method for both
the populations of fish one in fish too
we need to know how each population
changes with time I've written out
expressions for f1 and f2 dot showing
the time derivatives of each population
now in each equation we can see that
this first term is in the form of the
logistic growth function that I showed
you in the question introduction video
we have a growth rate and then 1 minus
the population over the carrying
capacity times the population again and
the same thing up here so these first
terms show the positive rate of change
of the population however each equation
also has a second part tacked on to it
that shows a negative rate of change
this expresses how each population is
harvested by the fishermen as i said
earlier p is the fraction of the fish
that we catch that are a fish type 2 or
the green fish we know then that the
rate of harvesting of the green type of
fish is going to be P times our total
harvest rate we can maintain the same
total harvest rate if we make the
coefficient in front of the harvest rate
in the equation for the red fish 1 minus
P remember we're trying to prevent the
green fish from going extinct so this
means that we need to create a situation
in which the rate of change of
population 2 is greater than or equal to
0 if we rearrange the equation for F 2
dot we should end up with this term
which is showing how the population can
gain fish should be greater than or
equal to this term which is showing how
the population can lose fish the value
of P that we're trying to calculate
however is the exact threshold of
extinction so this is going to happen
where growth exactly equals harvesting
in other words if there were any more
harvesting or any less growth population
two would become extinct eventually this
graph over here like you've seen before
has a blue curve that shows how the
growth rate changes with population and
also has a red curve that represents
harvesting rate now this first red line
is just an example of a harvest rate but
the one that we're interested in is this
dotted red line up here which just
touches the maximum of the growth curve
you might remember that this point on
the growth curve is also known as the
maximum sustainable yield you can see
that if we move the red line any higher
then the harvesting rate will always
exceed the growth rate and we will
definitely end up
with an extinct fish to population
similarly if we move anywhere else on
the blue line the growth rate will again
be below this harvest rate and we will
begin to deplete the population of fish
to right in the center however we have a
point of semi-stable equilibrium just
like you are talked about in the unit
any tiny bit that the population moves
to the left side of the curve will
result in it eventually falling all the
way down to zero which clearly means
that fish too has become extinct instead
we have slightly larger population than
five times ten to the fifth tons we will
again start to see a decrease in
population and if by chance the
population does not stop at exactly this
maximum point it will fall to the other
side of the curve and also become
extinct remember all this is assuming
that the harvesting rate is exactly at
the started line so now we need to find
what value of P will place the dotted
line right at this position again at
this point we have growth rate exactly
equal to harvesting rate so I've taken
the two parts of the equation for F 2
dot and written them as equal to each
other right here if we plug in the
proper value for F 2 which we know is 5
times 10 to the 5th tons then we can
solve using simple algebra for the
threshold value of P which equals 0
point 375 finally looking at our code
you can see that first we've plugged in
the value for P that we just calculated
Oh point 375 and down here in the for
loop we have a very simple translation
of the equations that we created for the
growth rates of both fish one and fish
to in a spots for the rate of change of
either population so for fish one we
have this and for fish to we have this
as always these rates of change ur
multiplied by H the step size and add it
to the initial values for either fish
population now let's run the program and
see what we get so here is our plot the
blue line plots the population of fish
that we're interested in harvesting
measured in tons and the green line
plots the population of the second type
of fish but you're trying to prevent
from going extinct can see that we have
maintained a high level of population of
the fish that we're interested in and
we've also prevented the green line from
going down to zero can see that as time
increases the slope of this line is
approaching zero which means that if we
plotted time going even further out no
matter how far out in time we decided to
plot these curves this green line would
never approach zero just for fun let's
see
what happens if we set P equal to 0
point 5 well this graph looks very
different from the last one that we had
by just increasing p by a third of its
former value we've made fish population
to go extinct in just over 20 years
since we're harvesting more of fish too
and less of fish one the fish one
population has actually risen to a value
that is higher than it was in the last
plot but we violated our first main
objective which was to prevent fish too
from going extinct I hope this problem
is helped you submit your understanding
of logistic growth harvesting and
equilibria</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
