project leader of the global hl7 fire
standardization effort he's here all the
way from Melbourne Australia for an hl7
meeting this week in Atlanta Graham
thank you very much for taking the time
to be much at me i know this is a busy
week for you perhaps we could begin by
you're discussing your background so I
qualified as a biochemist within a
clinical lab and did a bit of research
and then I ended up as a lab systems
vendor calculated and got more involved
in interoperability an actual seven and
eventually create my own consulting
company to do actual seven consulting so
beginning in $MONTH 2011 you invented
the whole idea of fire can you tell us
how that happened but we we were getting
to a point where the actual similar to
the crossroads we had a lot of existing
standards that no longer reflected what
people wanted to do and there was a lot
of unhappiness in the user community and
we said well what if we did something
like the Senate that grew into fire I
was a bit surprised to me as much as
everyone else that it was so popular but
it's been certainly keeping me busy ever
since
by all accounts that the growth of fire
adoption is nothing short of phenomenal
could you give us an idea of how it's
being adopted not just hear the US but
around the world we expected that
initially while it's still a trial beta
stand in which it still is that we would
have a little bit of adoption
particularly in companies doing health
data exchange in the social web area but
it's just been crazy
we have government programs large
government programs tomorrow instead
programs other national governments
around the world we have big vendors
doing creating consortiums like a ganar
and and I just pc lots of little
companies and institutions creating
solutions based on fire
you know we have thousands of
implementations happening at the moment
so I believe the the ballot on fire as a
second version of a draft standard for
trial use was just conducted or is being
conducted how where are we in the whole
evolution of fire to to a full hl7
standard so we we balance had to stand
in my and then we just published last
week in September the second formal
second version it's a it's an ongoing
process where we started with a very
little in initial draft and then this is
I think of this is the first fully
usable version and and we're calling a
trial version so we can still introduce
new content and refine the core standard
but increasingly we're going to treat
the core is a normative standard and I
think the next version will represent
stable version for implementers to base
the core clinical stuff on but you know
it's a it's an ongoing process and will
be very driven by the feedback we get
from the community about that which is
why we're not saying right now how all
unfold
we don't want to dictate to the
community well i have heard numbers in
terms of the the ultimate number of fire
resources anywhere from a hundred to two
hundred i suppose nobody actually knows
at this point we have 96 as of today and
we sort of said 200 was a nice number we
didn't want to have thousands or
hundreds of thousands which were
possible choices we haven't got a fixed
number that we're going to get to so
that leads directly to a topic you and I
have discussed when we were together in
the past the the to me the whole then
obviously the use of web services and
json objects these technologies are so
common and in other domains is is very
interesting i think very important to
the success of fire but it perhaps even
more interesting is your mission of not
allowing fire to become an overly
complex standard like many of the
predecessor standards in hl7 how is that
going that must be a very tough thing to
do
it's a interesting thing to try and do
we have
constant pressures to try and simplify
and constant pressures to try and
complicated and and we've got to strike
a balance between handling things people
need to do and not letting you get so
complicated no one can do what they need
to do most of the success in that area
comes from the processes that we laid
down at the start around solid
engagement with the implementation
community and and being responsive to
them and and we grade the successive
parts of the standard not by publication
but by adoption and that's a very
important metric that drives our water
consideration of the perspective than
just how do we produce a standard so the
people who only have to use the standard
and implemented have a big voice in what
the standard looks like it isn't just
designed by i'll use the term standards
geeks I hope hope that isn't a
pejorative term it's a very common 10
that's exactly what we're trying to
achieve so that you can define the
standard as a committee but until it's
been adopted and proven in practice it's
sunny it's always going to be draft so
as you look out toward the future after
the final version of fire is published
how do you see it continuing to evolve
and adapt to an ever-changing world any
community goes through phases of
storming norming conforming and then
clearly the core of the specification is
going to is moving into the normal phase
now and and will become more and more
stable and growth will happen at the
margins and then one is at some point
way you'll say that the standard is now
got as big as it can be instant longer
efficient to keep growing and to keep
pushing it along it's time to start
considering a new choice that I kind of
thought just looking at the past record
of standards that little lifespan
development lifespan maybe 15 years or
so only a sort of 515 now and
and at that point you start to say maybe
it's no longer worth keeping going you
know that's ten years that we'll see how
we go but at some point you guys just
not worth keeping going so one final
question so what would you say to the
students taking this course about fire
and about how they might both think
about it use it and and look for
opportunities that fire creates 50
different all the other approaches we
have had because it allows you to
modular eyes your solutions and to
create capabilities that can be used in
all sorts of different ways and so in
the long term it's going to represent
decomposing large systems into more
interoperable small systems and there's
gonna be a lot of opportunity for change
in the healthcare system not not a tenet
healthcare itself driven by the
capabilities of the decomposition and
the flexibility that offers yeah we we
didn't write fire because we wanted to
have a nice standard we weren't fired
because one of the implementations to
drive a better healthcare system and and
that's going to be a mine focus going
forwards is you know will round out the
standard and finalize the standard but
my main focus is going to be how do we
drive that to get a healthcare system
that's more nimble more patient focus
more responsive to it to change because
they're pretty existing systems pretty
pretty rigid well I not only want to
thank you i want to tell you how much I
admire you and what you're doing i I'm a
lot older than you are i'm not even sure
you were born when I got involved in
health IT and I never thought I'd
actually lived to see what we're seeing
which wich hi Grammy completely is an
absolutely workable implementable
deployables solution to interoperability
and into actually making health data a
tool for improving healthcare so
congratulations thank you so much thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
