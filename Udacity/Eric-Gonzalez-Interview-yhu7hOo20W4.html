instance for like course enrollments
right you will have more than one
ideally you'll have more than one course
that you're taking or you might be
enrolled in in an agree and or a set of
nine degrees and so those are all stored
as arrays when they come back so I might
say that you're in CS 101 and you're in
an Android course for instance and both
of those will show up it has an array
that I parse through the arrays are
useful just because you when you have a
like for instance a list of items a list
of items translates very well to like a
ListView or something else
so generally those are stored in some
type of array data structure so I don't
use primitive arrays but I will use
ArrayList for instance for because a lot
of the responses I receive are from the
server and I don't know the exact size
of them there's a case where maybe a
student's only enrolled in one course
but they could be also enrolled in 100
so I need to be able to accommodate both
cases and so an ArrayList will allow it
to grow or shrink based on the response
I get from the server so there's several
list views there's a lot of linear list
horizontal list you see list everywhere
pretty much in it so if you think of
your again to enrollment enrollments is
a list view if you have a nano degree
there's a special nano degree view
that's also a list view in that case and
so they're in several places it also
tracks tracks within the app if you are
scrolling horizontally that's a ListView
in itself as well so recycling views are
important because you want to try to use
as little memory as possible so you
really only want to render the views
that are on screen at any moment and
because the list could potentially be
very large and so as you're scrolling
through you're recycling the views to
make sure you're only rendering what can
fit on that screen the way we structure
data in the application is very much
still based on the concept so you go
through in the class so we do have the
notion of there's an attitude class
there's a lesson class there's morsels
there's all these individual units that
we model as Java objects within the
application a lot of times is kind of
especially working with an API many of
those decisions were already made
beforehand so because you're consuming
an API it's already been modeled in a
certain
you know what endpoints are hitting you
know what the responses are and those
responses generally are grouped
logically by some type of object</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
