we need is multiplication there's a few
key properties of multiplication that
will take advantage of the first is that
it's commutative that means that a times
B is always equal to B times a this is
true on integers it's also true using
any modulus this property also holds for
powers of powers that means for any
integers ADA to be raised to the C power
well that's equivalent to a to the B
times a to the B times a to the B C
times which is equivalent to a to the B
times C we're just adding powers when we
multiply here which is also equivalent
to a to the C times B we know that from
the accumulative property of
multiplication which is also equivalent
to a to the C to the B using the same
property here a to the C a to the C B
times these things are all equivalent
and they're also equivalent with modular
multiplication as well so that's the
main property that diffie-hellman key
exchange takes advantage of and I'm
going to show you the protocol next and
then we'll talk about why it's secure
and some of the details and actually
implementing it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
