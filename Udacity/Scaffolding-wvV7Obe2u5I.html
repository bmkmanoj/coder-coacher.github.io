starting point structure for your
project based on a couple of assumptions
that you control if they all you do is
create single page movie promotions do
your work hours your gum file might look
very similar every time in that case
writing it from scratch over and over is
inefficient it's very likely that you've
already done the most basic form of
scaffolding plenty of times copy and
paste to be fair that's a perfectly
valid way of doing things but it's not
the most elegant in the world of web
development let's take a look at some
pre-made scaffolding tools you'll find
links to all three in instructor notes
if you're just starting out the html5
boilerplate is a nice scaffolding
starting point all it does is give you a
seasoned basis for your CSS HTML and
JavaScript and make sure your HTML is
well-formed that for backs are provided
and that your CSS is normalized on top
the chips convenient stuff like Jake we
it has a simple build script to combine
and mini five files but doesn't come
with gulp or any other advanced build
tool you already past that stage for an
intermediate solution check out the web
starter kit it's an opinion at starting
point that we've built at Google that
already includes a build configuration
with life editing and so on but it won't
fit every project out there and finally
year man for the advanced users to which
I'm counting you now that you've reached
almost the end of our course you men is
the most flexible solution of the bunch
use it together with so called
generators have fit the job after
calling you man with a generator in this
case the web app one you men ask you a
few questions about what you need then
creates an empty project template based
on your preferences it's basically a
much fancier version of copy and paste
okay why talk about this now at the end
of the course there's no point in
letting a scaffolding to will generate a
project and build template that you have
no idea how to use and modify now that
you know all the basics you'll be much
more confident trying out various human
tasks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
