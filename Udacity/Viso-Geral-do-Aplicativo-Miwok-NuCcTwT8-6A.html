oh hey Kathryn I got these sketches from
Andre I'd wanna check them out
oh sure what do you think wow you look
really good yeah man so I'm liking all
of them but maybe we shouldn't use this
first one here why not well an Android
we generally don't like using splash
screens instead we jump directly into
the app content so the user doesn't have
to wait for the splash screen to load
okay how did you know that
well it's covered in the material design
guidelines oh yeah canola I totally
covered that in the last course the
students know that speck prints back but
you know knowing the speck is different
from actually applying it so I think we
could really use InDesign help oh
actually I'm glad you bring that up
so I know this amazing team of designers
so they can take our ideas the features
that we like and create some beautiful
mocks for us that sounds amazing
yeah so how about I'll take these
sketches to them okay get some walks
back and meet with you later okay thanks
alright see you soon
so when you first open the app we see a
list of categories numbers family
members colors and phrases if you click
on the numbers category it shows a list
of numbers and for the number one we
have the English and Miwok words as well
as an image and a button to play the
Miwok pronunciation aloud and the same
applies for the family colors and
phrases categories so phrases such as
what's your name and how are you feeling
don't really have an intuitive image to
go along with them as a result we decide
to show the English and Miwok
translations with option to play the
sound as well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
