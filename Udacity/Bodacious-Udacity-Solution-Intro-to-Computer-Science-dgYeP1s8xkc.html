out you daesh's without using any quotes
we're gonna do that by using the
subsequence operator the colon let's say
we want to get the first five characters
from s in the last three from T since we
want to print a result out
we need the print statement and let's
print our S part first you want to go
from the beginning so we're just going
to put the coal in there and we want to
go 0 1 2 3 4 since you want to include
the 4th character
we're gonna go end it at 5 now we want
the rest that come from T which is the
last three characters so we're not going
to want to start at the beginning we're
going to start at 0 1 2 3 4 5 6
character and we want to go to the end
this will print out you Daysha s--
without using any quotes as you can see
but there's another solution if you're a
true Python guru let's go to the
interpreter to try that out so we have
our two strings s and T let's say you're
like me and you don't like counting
above the number 4 and we still want to
solve this problem without using any
quotes so we're going to have our print
and we're going to use everything but
the last 2 characters and s as we did
before since we know all we want is
everything but the last 2 characters we
can just type in negative 2 this gives
us the first part we had an S but
without having the count one character
at a time until the end let's do the
same thing with T here we have a little
different problem we want to start with
the last three characters we're going to
use the same negative notation and go
all the way to the end this gives us our
two parts so all we have to do is
combine them and we get this result
without having count really at all</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
