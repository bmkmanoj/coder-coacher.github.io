happy Friday happy coffee break I'm
Chelsey Glasson I am in course developer
for design of everyday things I'm also
lead user researcher here at Udacity and
I'm happy to report that we're making
some great progress with design of
everyday things and last week done and I
spent some time at the home of tog tog
Mazzini a very famous designer and he
and Dawn had a very messy fun example
concerning conceptual models that I
thought I'd share with you so enjoy you
know one of the things we both of us
have talked about for a long time is the
importance of a conceptual bottle the
fact that you know the designer has some
model of what this thing is and the
person using it is trying to figure out
what the model is and the only thing to
go on is the device itself and you said
you had trouble with this and it looks
to me like it's a pretty straightforward
Bowl so what's the story well I came
across this at a hotel in Stockholm
Sweden they had a whole big stack of
them jumbled up for us to put our
breakfast cereal in and so I made the
mistake of putting my breakfast cereal
in it I poured the cereal into the bowl
and then I added some milk and I do like
my milk so all the way after the rim
yeah
coz that's just the way I like it and
then I put it down on the table yeah now
that does not require an a warning
notice that requires a redesign so the
conceptual model of a pose that is flat
yes horizontally that's what pin is
you're holding it this way it looks like
it is right yes and particularly the way
it was jumbled One Bowl on top of the
other now what was it it was intended
for was to make a nice presentation for
having the chef fill this bowl and then
a waiter bring it out to your table so
they'd pressed it into a different
service so Amy you found this in a hotel
in Sweden yes how do you have it in your
home in California
I bought it from them they didn't want
they didn't want to sell it to me and I
insist upon it if you do this often
spill it you find of guests no no my
wife does not allow me to do that very
often at all and I see it's continuing
to pour I can see why she doesn't yell I
think I'll be cleaning it up now great I
hope you guys enjoyed that please sign
up for the course if you haven't already
and like us on facebook for updates
we've also recently uploaded some fun
photographs from various aspects of
filming so feel free to check those out
as well Cheers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
