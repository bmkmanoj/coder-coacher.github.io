where 20 falls on this distribution it's
here between seven point eight one
standard deviation away from the mean
and twenty two point six so the z-score
will be somewhere between one and two
let's find out what it is exactly so we
find the distance from the mean which is
now going to be positive and divided by
the standard deviation we get that
twenty is one point four six standard
deviations away from the mean now let's
bring up our Z table so like I said
before if we have our z-score we'll find
the proportion less than that z-score so
let's start with that
the proportion less than one point four
six is 0.92 seventy nine here at one
point four and then the top of this
column is 0.06 so if the proportion less
than twenty is 0.92 seventy-nine then
the area above it must be one minus
point nine two seven nine because
remember the total area under the curve
will always be one this is point zero
seven to one so about seven point two
one percent of students have gotten more
than twenty points per post on average
if you've gotten more than twenty points
per post on average then you're in the
93rd percentile of students
congratulations
before we move on I'm going to show you
one more way to look at this since the
data is symmetrical then that means that
the amount greater than one point four
six is equal to the amount less than
negative one point four six that means
that we don't necessarily have to
calculate the proportion less than one
point four six and then subtract it from
one we could just find the proportion
less than negative one point four six
and we find that the proportion less
than negative one point four six is the
same thing that we calculated before
point zero seven to one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
