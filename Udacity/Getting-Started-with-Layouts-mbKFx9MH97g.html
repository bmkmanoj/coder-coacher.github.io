development then you'll be familiar with
the box model in CSS layouts if you
haven't let's take a quick tour now all
UI elements in Android take up a
rectangular space equal to the minimum
rectangle needed to enclose the object
we call this the content bounds take
this avatar placeholder image for
example even though the image is a
circle its content bounds are this
enclosing rectangle well that's not
entirely accurate the object's bounds
also include any padding that is any
space that's considered to be part of
the object that push its bounds outwards
so in our example the bounds would be
equal to the content area plus any
padding applied to it when positioning
an element relative to other elements
you might also want to leave some space
between them this is where we can use
margins to add extra space between
objects that critically isn't considered
to be part of the element so we've seen
how both padding and margins can be used
to add extra space around an element so
you might be wondering when to use one
or the other
or perhaps even a combination of both
now the key thing to remember is that if
you want the space to be part of the
object then you should use padding and
if you don't want to be part of the
object then you should use margin so
when do you want it to be part of the
object becomes the question the answer
is if you want the touchable area or the
background of the objects to be enlarged
then use padding otherwise use margin so
in our example if you want this avatar
to be clickable of a nice big touch
target but we don't want any touch
highlight to extend to 5 towards the
other items we could use a combination
of padding around the element to enlarge
the touch area and their margin between
the elements to separate them out
without that being part of the clickable
zone for those familiar with the web box
model notice that there is no concept of
borders or you can still apply borders
these are typically achieved using
background images</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
