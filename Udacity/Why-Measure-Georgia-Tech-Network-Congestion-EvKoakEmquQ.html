on the network one reason might be
billing so for example we might want to
charge a customer based on how much
traffic they've sent on the network in
order to do so we need to passively
measure how much traffic that customer
is sending here's an example of
measurements of inbound and outbound
traffic volumes on a link on the Georgia
Tech campus network the y-axis is shown
in bits per second and the x-axis is the
time of day now a user might be billed
based on how much traffic they send on
the network a common mode of billing is
called 95th percentile billing where a
customer pays for what's called a
committed information rate or a Cir and
throughput is measured every five
minutes the customer then may be build
on the 95th percentile of these five
minute samples so if we were to bill on
the 95th percentile of inbound traffic
we might approximate that 95th
percentile by the orange line I've drawn
here and the customer might be billed at
this rate even though they're allowed to
sometimes burst at higher rates another
common reason to measure is security for
example network operators may want to
know the type of traffic that's being
sent on the network so they can detect
rogue behavior a network operator may
want to measure traffic on the network
to detect compromised hosts or the
presence of botnets or denial of service
attacks two phenomena that we'll talk
about later on in the course for the
rest of this lesson since we focused a
lot on performance measurement already I
will mainly focus on passive traffic
data measurement</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
