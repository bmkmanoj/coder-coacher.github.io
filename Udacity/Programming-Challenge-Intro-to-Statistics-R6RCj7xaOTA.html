this is completely optional and is
fairly challenging and requires a decent
knowledge of programming but if you're
up for a challenge
and want to learn to do something fun
let's dive in we have a bag filled with
coins each of these coins may be a bit
different this coin may have a
probability of landing on heads of 0.5
and this coin might have a probability
of 0.1 now I'm going to draw one coin
from this bag and I'm going to flip it
repeatedly and each time I flip it I'd
like you to tell me what your best guess
is for the probability of it being heads
on the next flip to do this we're going
to write a program in Python what we're
going to ask you to write is a Python
class called flip predictor that's going
to take the set of coins in the bag in
this case coins with probabilities of
landing on heads of 0.5 0.4 and 0.3 then
we're going to flip the coin several
times in this case the results were
heads heads tails and heads after every
flip will tell you what the result was
and then we'll ask you to tell us what
the probability of heads will be the
next time we flip the coin so to solve
this remember that Bayes rule tells us
that the probability of the coin
selected being a given coin is equal to
the probability of the flip being what
it was that it's heads or tails given
coin I times the probability of coin I
being the coin divided by the
probability of the flip either heads or
tails so now let's look at the code
you're going to have to write
so here we are back in our editor with
an outline of the program you're going
have to write first we just make
division work the way you would expect
it to work that is 1/2 equals 0.5 so you
don't have to think about it then we
define this thing called a class if you
aren't familiar with what a class is
don't worry you're not going to actually
have to do anything with the class we
set up the class right here for you a
class is just a way of grouping
functions and data those functions can
use so here we just set up our data and
that is we're given a set of coins in
our bag and we just call that self dot
coins and so in these functions down
here you're going to be able to access
the coins in your bag as self dot coins
and that's going to be a Python list and
then we create this new list called self
dot probz and that's just going to be a
list with the same number of items as in
coins giving the probability at each
point in time of a coin being the coin
selected at first since the coin was
selected at random that probability is
simply 1 over N so if there are three
coins it's a third if there are ten
coins it's a tenth so what I'd like you
to do is fill in these two functions P
heads is a function that just returns
the probability of heads right now so
given your best guess of the current
probabilities what's the probability of
coming up with hats and you can compute
this using self dot probs and self coins
then for the slightly trickier part I
want you to write an update function and
that's going to take a result either an
H or a T and based on that result you're
going to update self dot probs so that P
heads will return the correct value in
the future good luck
this is a very challenging problem
I hope you enjoy it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
