single function which has a embedded
function that it calls and so there's
two parts to this we we have to first
iterate over all the squares in the
board and then for each of the squares
of the board we want to find all the
paths that generate words and follow all
possible paths but cut them off when we
have to stop so here I said we can
enumerate over the locations and the
letters that are in the board numerate
over them if the letter is not a border
character then we want to extend the
path starting with that letter and that
location so extend path says I have a
prefix so far which may or may not be a
word and I have a path where the path is
defined as a list of locations that I
visited so far and I need that because I
can't have a pen a circle back on itself
I can't use a location twice so I need
to know where I've been before and this
is similar to the structure of fine
words but it's constrained to looking on
the board through the neighbors so what
do I do I say if the prefix is in the
words I've already found a word and the
length of that prefix is greater than
the minimum length that I'm looking for
then I add it to the results here that
won't have happened because I'm just
looking at the first letter say the
letter P in location I that's not going
to be a word it's not going to be
greater than the min length so I keep
going if the prefix is in my list of my
set of prefixes and then I look for
every neighboring square J which is a
neighbor of the last element of my path
so my path is going to be I start in
this location go to the next location go
the next location the last element of
the path is where I was last I want to
expand out from there to all the
neighbors and if that J is not in the
path if I haven't circled back yet
and if the contents of that J is not a
border square if it is a valid letter
then I just extend the path I add that
letter on to the prefix I add that
location on to the path and continue
recursively call
and eventually I'll add all the possible
words now part of the Zen of Python is
that flat is better than nested why did
I nest here well it's a judgement call
you certainly could have pulled this out
but if I did pull it out I would need to
pass in this parameter n the board and
the result so to be three more
parameters that I had to pass in and I
just thought it seemed a little bit
simpler to only have to call it with two
here and here and only receive two here
rather than add in those three
additional arguments and I guess I
should say you know because extend path
is only seven lines long I felt it was
justified to have it be nested if it
grew much more than ten lines then I'd
be very reluctant to have it be nested I
would probably pull it out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
