the right most value of the picture to
the left we'll add 10 and then we
translate pick by that amount that's the
statement now we need to do that for all
of the pictures so i need to add the
loop header I've done that often enough
that my fingers can do it on autopilot
here goes pretty soon your fingers will
be able to do that too let's go and
compile and let's run the program hmm
that did not seem to work now did it
let's see the program crashed and I'm
told that there is an array index out of
bounds exception and the index there was
out of bounds was minus 1 well minus 1
is not a valid array index but why would
have gotten a minus 1 i'll look at this
i is 0 so over here this i is 0 and then
the i minus 1 is 0-1 and that's bad now
the problem is that when i'm at the 0th
picture that's the initial picture in
the sequence there is nothing to the
left so the remedy is to start here with
i equals 1 the zeros picture that stays
word was picture at index 1 then gets
moved to the right of the one at index 0
and that's all great so in this case my
fingers shouldn't have been on autopilot
but I should have thought through what
values for I I actually want it's very
very common in actual programming to get
these kinds of errors and I wanted to
show you how it looks like when you do
now let's try this and look at that our
pictures are finally arranged in a neat
sequence</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
