it's a procedure that takes in one input
and we'll name the input P as the name
for our parameter and I tend to use P as
the name for a list there's no really
good reason for that I don't want to use
the letter L because L looks too much
like a 1 I don't want to use M N or O
because m and n are used usually to
represent numbers and oh looks too much
like a 0 so the first good letter to use
after L is P of course you could use any
name you want for your parameter name to
define some list we're going to
introduce a variable to keep track of
the sum so far let's call that result
and initially the value of the result is
zero next we'll use a for loop to go
through the elements so we're going to
go through the elements of P each time
we execute the block of the for loop the
value of e will be the current element
of P and we'll go through the loop once
for each element of P in order so what
we want to do is add that value to
result when we get to the end of the for
loop that means we've gone through all
the elements and we should return the
results let's try this in the Python
interpreter so we've defined some list
let's try running it we do get the value
12 what do you think would happen if we
run some lists like this passing in the
empty list
the answer is we get the value 0 which
is what we expect right the sum of no
elements is 0 and if we look at the code
that's exactly what happens initially we
set the result to 0 the for loop goes
through all the elements of P but if
there are no elements of P it doesn't
execute at all and so we go to the next
statement which returns the result which
has the value 0</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
