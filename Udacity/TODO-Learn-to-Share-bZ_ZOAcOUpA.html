can effectively guide the users
attention in ways at both inform and
delight use motion to smoothly transport
users between navigational contexts
explain changes in the arrangement of
elements on the screen and reinforce
element hierarchy we aren't really doing
that yet but we can add something that
does a shared element transition when we
talk about shared elements we're really
talking about Android views that contain
content that is shared between two
different activities we animate the
transition between the activities by
moving and scaling the element into
place which draws the eye to the element
and creates continuity between the two
activities it's relatively easy to add a
shared element to the transition we've
already created we first need to tell
Android which views in both activities
are paired up we start by adding a
transition name to the view in the
destination layout will also want to add
a transition named any view that we're
transitioning from so that the system
can find it again in case it has to tear
down the activity thanks to rotating the
device or some other hardware change if
the shared view is filled out when the
activity is first created that's all
we'd have to do however many activities
do things like create a fragment to then
need to go to the database to fetch the
shared element both of which typically
involve asynchronous tasks and we are
using best Android practices we also
want to wait for any layout to be
complete fortunately there's a solution
for that we can ask Android to wait
before beginning the transition using
support postponed enter transition and
Teller we're ready by using support
start postpone to enter transition we
have to be a bit careful here about how
long we postpone things as we've pretty
much stopped the world in motion let me
do this ie going out to the network
while we've postponed things isn't going
to work well since I try very hard to
keep display related logic in layouts
I'm going to create an attribute to
enable postponing the enter transition
in forecast fragment I then read the
attribute in the on inflate method for
the detail fragment i'll add a flag is
an argument and read it during the
oncreate view method</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
