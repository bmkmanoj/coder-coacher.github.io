of the angle between them is computed by
the dot product operation so this is the
dot it's a big dot and these are denoted
as vectors by putting arrows over them
the dot product is equivalent to
multiplying the x value of a times the x
value of B and so on with y and z and
then adding these up together say I have
these two normalized vectors and I want
to find the cosine of the angle between
them the dot product is then 0 times 0.8
and so on the next two values multiplied
and so on this comes out to be these
three terms added together which equals
0.6 so this is the cosine of the angle
between these two vectors out of
curiosity if we take the arc cosine of
this value zero point six we get fifty
three point one three degrees however we
don't really care about the angle we
truly want the cosine as this is how
much will scale the light's contribution
to the surface the dot product is a
little mysterious and is so fundamental
to a large part of computer graphics
that it's worth building up some
understanding of what it really means
why does this operation have any
connection with cosine</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
