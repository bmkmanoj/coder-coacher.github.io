scan that was popularized in a 1986
paper by Danny Hillis and guy Steele who
are two really interesting people Danny
Hillis founded a company that built a
massively parallel computer called the
thinking machine which had scan as one
of its core primitives and
awesome-looking blinky lights he
designed it for AI applications and said
that his goal was to build a computer
that was proud of him at Thinking
Machines he worked with guy Steele who
developed the scheme programming
language at MIT and later was one of the
core developers of java anyway back to
scan and this particular algorithm the
easiest way to show it is simply to draw
it so we're going to start with an input
array that's simply the numbers 1 to 8
so the first stage of this algorithm
involves adding yourself to your name or
one away so for instance 1 plus 2 is
going to give you 3 2 plus 3 is going to
give you 5 and so on let me come back to
the beginning and anything that doesn't
have a left neighbor we just copy its
value down Stage two is going to involve
adding yourself to your neighbor 2 to
the left so let's see how that's going
to work 1 plus 5 gives you 6 3 plus 7
gives you 10 and so on and again if you
don't have a neighbor 2 to the left then
you just copy your value down final
stage now you're going to add yourself
to your neighbor 4 to the left so we add
1 in 14 giving us 15 add 3 18 and give
us 21 and so on and again if you don't
have a neighbor 4 to the left then
you'll just copy your own value down and
now take a look at what we got this
bottom row here is the inclusive scan of
the top row here so what's the algorithm
that we used here starting with step 0
there's the steps here on step I your
job at each location is to add yourself
to your neighbor to the left 2 to the I
hops away so here one hop away your two
hops away and here four humps away and
if you don't have a neighbor that far to
the left you just copy yourself from the
previous iteration so as a quiz let's
analyze the complexity of this
computation so as a function of n the
input size how much work are we going to
do in this algorithm and how many steps
is it going to take</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
