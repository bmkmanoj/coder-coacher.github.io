privacy policy other than collection use
and sharing which is now what do they
how hard do they work to address the
security of that information many of its
services actually use HTTPS or use
encryption I mentioned that they do
stronger authentication they do
two-factor authentication now password
and then they send you a on your phone
they send you a code that that you use
and they use other safeguards we talked
about a lot of technical safeguards for
protecting information or securing
information so they they do all these
things so the private information that
they have about you is not doesn't get
into the hands of malicious actors they
do have something about changing the
privacy all these things we are talking
about if they want to change any aspect
of these they will not change them and
change in a way where that reduces your
rights without your consent so the idea
the privacy policy says well if we ever
want to go to a more lacks privacy
policy okay which is what reducing your
rights is we would ask you and only if
you can send to that we will change the
policy in such a way that you know you
can view it as more lacks than what they
had before ok so we repeating the policy
says what we collect how we use it are
we share it are we secured and if
anything changes about the policy what
would it take to do that it's a that
sort of quick brief overview of what a
privacy policy should look like we use
this example on google but you can go
study somebody else's privacy policy and
see what aspects of that of the things
that we discussed here are covered in
that policy and what is not covered</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
