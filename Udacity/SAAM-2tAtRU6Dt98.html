have already gone through an
architectural design process and if we
produce some artifacts like diagrams so
we generate that architecture we also
generate some scenarios now these are
not primarily usage scenarios or we can
think of them as elaborated usage
scenarios where instead of looking at it
from the outside external view we're
looking at it more internally so for
example if if the external request is by
the user to compute some result the
generated scenario here that we the team
provides is which elements of the
architecture are required to be involved
in providing that functionality and in
what order that is we essentially are
going to walk through the diagram and
see how that particular usage of the
system impacts the architecture this is
particularly important if what we're
talking about is a new scenario that is
imagine a system that was architected
one way and we want to add a new new new
functionality to it imagine also that
maybe there are thoughts on different
ways of doing this so if we had
alternative proposals each provided in
the form of some kind of diagram we
could walk through the two diagrams and
see which one in which one there's more
impact of the change we might want to go
with the solution which has the the
lesser impact and so imagine this all
happening in some kind of design review
meeting in which we systematically go
through the proposed changes to proposed
architectural responses to them and use
the gathered information to come to come
to some kind of conclusion about the way
forward</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
