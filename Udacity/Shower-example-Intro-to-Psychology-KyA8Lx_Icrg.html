you're in the shower and as you turn the
shower handle off and the water stops
the shower handle breaks off now you
immediately assess what this event means
to you you might become very stressed
out when you realize that you're going
to have to call a plumber that's going
to be expensive you're going to have to
make time to meet the plumber can have
to clean your apartment to make it
presentable can have to find a place to
put your cat so the cat doesn't talk the
plumber when the plumber comes in and
the list goes on and on and on about
what stress results just from breaking
off your shower handle this was a
primary appraisal you quickly assess
what happened and your emotional
response to it which most certainly
would have been a negative emotional
response because you're stressed about
everything you have to do just to fix
the shower handle however when this
actually did happen to me I stopped took
a second to think about it and my stress
level actually decreased first I thought
this is a great opportunity to get a new
shower handle and new showerhead second
I thought how lucky I was that the
shower handle didn't break off when the
water was still running because I don't
know how to try the water off in my
apartment so I would have just been
standing there with a broken shower
handle in my hand and the water just
running I would have known what to do
third I thought that I needed to clean
my apartment anyway so this is a great
opportunity to make it nice and
presentable</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
