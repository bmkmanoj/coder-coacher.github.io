what's the answer walk me through I will
walk you through all right so let's
let's do this let's write the Euclidean
distance well let's write the Manhattan
distance because I don't want to take
square roots in my head okay let's write
the Manhattan distances next to the X's
okay or the Y's anyway let's do it next
to the XS so this is the Manhattan
distance or MD as the cool kids call it
is that you yeah the cool kids called it
l1 no no no no no have you ever heard a
cool kid ever say something like l1 well
to me the cool kids are the people at
nips who know more math than I do yeah
do you think any of them are gonna watch
this video actually I'm afraid all of
them are gonna watch this video and now
I'm really afraid mmm so you better get
it right
everyone's watching all right well let
me do let me compute the Manhattan
distances so the first one what you do
is you take the 1 minus 4 mm-hmm and
that's 3 and you take the 6 minus 2 and
that's 4 and you add those two together
then you get 7 which interestingly is
the same as Y but I think that's a
coincidence okay so yeah and now I'll do
all the rest of them because I pre
computed them four six eight four six
all right so now we've got it set up so
we can do one and three nearest neighbor
relatively quickly so the one nearest
neighbor the closest distance is four
mm-hmm and but unfortunately there are
two points that have that 2 comma 4 and
7 combo one we have outputs of 8 and 50
because they almost agree with each
other
uh-huh and if we take the average of
those two things we get 29 yep
that is correct Michael great now in
terms of the three nearest neighbors we
have the forest and the sixes mmm so
there's four three nearest neighbors yep
somewhat awkwardly and then we have the
average of those things which is what 8
+ 50 + 16 + 68 which gets us thirty five
point five great obviously okay all
right so that was pretty straightforward
and those answers aren't too far off
from one another so what about the
Euclidian case all right so one thing to
point out I was worried about computing
square roots but it occurs to me that I
actually don't have to compute square
roots
because that's a monotonic
transformation and we only care about
the orders hmm so for Euclidean distance
or as I like to call him casually Edie
mm-hmm we can just take the square
differences some done okay so this would
be head squared yes it would be at
squared okay
I did good so the first one it'll be the
1 minus 4 is 3 squared is 9 and the 6
minus 2 is 4 squared is 16 and 9 plus 16
is 25 so the first one will be 25 and
those the square root of 25 is pretty
easy to compute yeah but at the other
ones aren't gonna be it just so happens
that we've got a Pythagorean triple on
our hands hmm
I love those all right so the remaining
ones the ED squares are 8 26 40 10 and
20 none of those are easily square root
of all exactly though 40 feels like it
really was trying and failed yeah an 8 8
overshot and now it's a perfect cube so
8 is the smallest distance yep and again
seemingly coincidentally the Y value
associated with that is 8 so an 8 is 8
is our answer
good and that's correct all right and
the three closest are 8 10 and 20 mm-hmm
and if we average the Y values for those
that's 850 and 68 which gives us an
average of 42 the meaning of life the
universe and pretty much everything yes
and that is absolutely correct so that's
kind of a that's kind of cool that you
get completely different answers
depending upon what you do yeah it does
seem very different doesn't it I mean
there's like several orders of magnitude
spread here well maybe not order the
magnitude but orders of doubling yes
they're orders of doubling spread well
you know what Michael I actually had a
specific function in mind when I did
this okay let's find out which one is
the right one well the function I had
was Y was equal to the first dimension
squared plus the second dimension so
let's call those X 1 and X 2 and this
was actually the function that I had in
place so you square the first term and
you had the second one okay and so like
looking at the second the last one for
example 7 squared is 49 plus 1 is 5
that's cool yeah it's very consistent
thank you so what would be the actual
answer for 4 comma 2
okay so 4 squared is 16 plus 2 is 18
which is close to none of them right so
there's a lesson here there's several
lessons here and one lesson I don't want
you to take away so here's a here the
lesson so I actually had a real function
here there was no noise it was fairly
well represented the proper answer was
18 and basically none of these are right
but the first thing I want you to notice
is you get completely different answers
depending upon exactly whether you do
one versus three whether you Zook Lydian
versus Manhattan and that's because
these things make assumptions about your
domain that might not be particularly
relevant and this sort of suggests that
maybe this thing doesn't do very well
kanan doesn't do very well because none
of these are close to 18 that seems a
little sad but I've got good news for
you Michael okay the good news is that
actually K&amp;amp;N tends to work really really
well especially given its simplicity it
just doesn't in this particular case and
there's really a reason for that and it
has to do with the sort of fundamental
assumptions and bias of K and n I happen
to pick an example that sort of violates
some of that bias so I think it's
worthwhile to take a moment to think
about what the preference bias is for K
n and to see if that can lead us to
understanding why we didn't get anything
close to 18 here okay that sounds useful
okay so let's do that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
