algorithm to achieve what's called a
maximum matching conceptually we have a
router with n inputs and outputs but of
course the inputs are also outputs it's
just easier to think about the inputs
and outputs being separate when we talk
about the switching problem now in each
time slot we would like to achieve a
one-to-one mapping between inputs and
outputs which is a matching and our goal
is that the matching should be maximal
so in a particular time slot we might
have a certain set of traffic demands or
traffic at certain input ports that is
destined for certain output ports and
our goal is given these demands to
produce a matching that is maximal and
fair now given demands for a particular
time slot and the resulting matching
notice that certain demands were not
satisfied these packets that arrived at
inputs must wait until the next time
slot to be forwarded to the appropriate
output port because they couldn't be
matched in the same time slot as those
shown here remember that there must be
exactly a one-to-one matching between
any inputs and outputs in a particular
time slot most router crossbars have a
notion of speed up where by multiple
matchings can be performed in the same
time slot so for example if the line
cards are running at say 10 gigabits per
second then running the interconnect
twice as fast would allow matchings to
occur twice as fast as packets would
arrive on the inputs or be forwarded
from the outputs it is thus common
practice to run the interconnect at a
higher speed than the input and output
ports just speeding up the interconnect
does not solve all problems note for
example that in this set of demands we
have packets arriving at this input port
destined for this output port but if
there's only a single queue at this
input the packets that are destined for
the output port circled in orange might
actually be blocked behind a set of
packets that are destined for other
output ports so even if we could induce
a speed up at the interconnect certain
packets may be blocked in the queue by
packets
ahead of them destined for other output
ports</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
