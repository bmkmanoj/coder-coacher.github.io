algorithm to achieve what's called a
maximal matching
conceptually we have a router with n
inputs and outputs but of course the
inputs are also outputs it's just easier
to think about the inputs and outputs
being separate when we talk about the
switching problem now in each time slot
we would like to achieve a one-to-one
mapping between inputs and outputs which
is a matching and our goal is that the
matching should be maximal so in a
particular time slot we might have a
certain set of traffic demands or
traffic at certain input ports that is
destined for certain output ports and
our goal is given these demands to
produce a matching that is maximal and
fair
now given demands for a particular time
slot and the resulting matching notice
that certain demands were not satisfied
these packets that arrived at inputs
must wait until the next time slot to be
forwarded to the appropriate output port
because they couldn't be matched in the
same time slot as those shown here
remember that there must be exactly a
one-to-one matching between any inputs
and outputs in a particular time slot
most router crossbars have a notion of
speed-up whereby multiple matchings can
be performed in the same time slot so
for example if the line cards are
running at say 10 gigabits per second
then running the interconnect twice as
fast would allow matchings to occur
twice as fast as packets would arrive on
the inputs or be forwarded from the
outputs it is thus common practice to
run the interconnect at a higher speed
than the input and output ports just
speeding up the interconnect does not
solve all problems note for example that
in this set of demands
we have packets arriving at this input
port destined for this output port but
if there's only a single queue at this
input the packets that are destined for
the output port circled in orange might
actually be blocked behind a set of
packets that are destined for other
output ports so even if we could induce
a speed up at the interconnect
certain packets may be blocked in the
queue by packets
ahead of them destined for other output
ports</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
