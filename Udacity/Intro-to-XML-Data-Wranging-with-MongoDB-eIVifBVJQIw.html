course of my career I've used XML in a
number of different data science
projects one of these was working with a
large collection of research articles so
just as an example here's the original
Google paper from Brin and page when
they were still grad students at
Stanford now what I was doing in this
project is what's known as citation
analysis in citation analysis what we're
doing is comparing the relative
importance of papers based on how many
other research articles cite them so for
example you could compare the Google
paper with some of my work which
receives a much more modest number of
citations compared to the eleven
thousand that brynan pages paper got now
when I was doing my work most of the
data that I used was not publicly
available but nowadays the same type of
data is available and it's encoded as
XML there are quite a few open access
publishers like biomed central these
publishers produce every article they
publish both in a print form like this
and in XML now in order to do something
like citation analysis what we need to
do is access the bibliography for each
article so what I want to look at as an
example is how easy it is when you have
your data encoded as XML to pull out
that type of data and use it
programmatically so let's take a look at
the references for this paper here are
all of the other papers that this
particular research article cites now
let's take a look at the XML version of
this paper here is that exact same paper
only here instead of being designed for
reading it is instead encoded as data
let's jump down to the bibliography for
this paper and here it is the very
beginning of the bibliography if we take
a look at the print version of the
article again we can see that it does in
fact align with what we're seeing here
so this type of use of XML is very much
what the designers of XML had in mind
where you have documents that have lots
of text but text that you want to encode
so that portions of it at least can be
used programmatically like we might want
to do with the bibliography of a
research article or the author list and
other data that occurs throughout a
document like this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
