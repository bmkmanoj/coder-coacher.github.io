purpose of standards the final dimension
is technology and this is particularly
applicable to messaging standards where
the messages must be constructed from
data standards in a manner that can be
understood by the systems that receive
them we just discussed why departments
in a hospital that want to share
information with each other so for
example an order can flow from the
physician caring for the patient to the
lab and the results of the tests can
come back messaging standards serve that
purpose but now we're looking at the
technology in which those standards are
implemented and formatted early
messaging standards were created using
EDI x12 a standard that evolved in other
industries to automate business
processes such as ordering invoicing and
payment EDI x12 was developed in the
early days of computing when memory and
storage were still dere so it is quite
cryptic and compact as you can see here
note that with some effort we can tell
that this involves a clinical lab and a
glucose test but most of the details are
not obvious in fact understand each
specific field typically requires a
reference guide more recently messaging
and document standards have been
developed using XML a modern syntax that
is verbose but has the advantages of
being more human readable and easily
rendered in a browser this is the same
lab test result we just looked at while
it's still not easy to read we can much
more easily tell that it was a blood
glucose level that its value is 182 it
says value right there and we can see
the normal ranges for the test are 72
