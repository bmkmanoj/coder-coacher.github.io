against code or procedures that we write
so this is a tough question figuring out
how to test code is something that
requires a lot of experience and it's
something we will have an entire course
on software testing I'm fairly soon the
way that thing about testing is
definitely to think about what all the
inputs are so any procedure has they've
currently many inputs so you definitely
can't try them all and that means you
need to think about the different kinds
of inputs and boundary cases are usually
good things to test for so if the inputs
are things like strings the boundary
taste is an empty string so you might
want to test the procedure with an empty
string with a long string with some
other strings if it's something where
the content of the string matters like
the fine last question for number two
well then you've also got to think about
different kinds of content in the string
where maybe there's no matches all where
there's lots of matches where there's
one match so it's definitely requires
some creativity to think of all the
boundary cases and test them but that's
really what you're trying to do this to
think of all the things that might make
your code behave differently and all the
things that maybe if you didn't think
about them your code wouldn't behave
correctly for ya boundary cases are a
good place to start yeah make sure even
if you think your procedure will only
take in negative numbers or positive I
mean if you've only if you think your
procedures only take some positive
number it doesn't hurt to design the
case where it handles things outside
right and often for the hell marks for
this class we're trying to specify
fairly limited sets of inputs that you
have to think about that it only has to
work for positive integers but as you're
writing code especially if you write
code that goes up on the web you have no
control over what inputs people's into
it so that's often where that the
problems happen not yeah I came back we
plan on trying to be as clear as
possible in the future what kind of
inputs what kind of expect we that was
something we could have done better on
early on
we try to make sure there's no nothing
surprising in there but sometimes there
were some tricky test cases for
definitely that the fine last question s
fine last figure test cases vent and
might have been fair for them yeah so
that was some difficult not probably
shouldn't have tested empty strings
right testing the empty string I mean
the Deaf and what it does is even kind
of undefined when you're searching for
an empty string and an empty string
right um and one of the error cases for
that was your code runs forever if there
were lots of pretty close solution to
this that on the empty string example
your code would run forever which
unfortunately the way the server is
working out made us look like I couldn't
tell the difference between that and
when the server was goes down so so that
definitely was not not the ideal way for
that question to work we had a lot of
heaven enjoying uh who has a question
yes would you like to introduce yourself
in each course I was a bunch of lost in
the forums yeah so we've seen this
question and we understand people
wanting to know these numbers we are a
little reluctant to release them when we
actually don't have numbers specific for
courses right now and part of the
reluctance to release them is there is a
lot of noise about sort of numbers of
students enrolled in classes and those
really aren't the numbers that we care
about or that we should care about and
if people start competing for numbers of
students in courses that's really
measuring the wrong thing and it's sort
of the same reason that in the early
days on Google search engine they said
the number of pages they index on the
web and they keep increasing that number
and having you know we've indexed
billions and billions of pages and then
other search engines started competing
by trying to have higher numbers and
then Google decided to remove that that
it's not a good measure of how good a
search engine is just the number of
pages you index and if your goal is to
increase that number there are lots of
ways to index more pages that make your
search engine work
that you're indexing the same page
multiple times so it's actually quite
hard to get an accurate count of how
many people are really taking the class
and we want to do that we're trying to
figure out good ways to do that but we
want to be a little careful not to
beliefs meaningless numbers just based
on the number of email addresses we have
or the number of people that come the
website I mean the answer your question
is right now we don't really know okay
good will that be something you'll
figure once the course ends I'm gonna
track I will probably go well definitely
you know know at the end of the course
how many people have completed the
course and I think that's probably stat
number that'll be something with you
know that's really but in terms of our
what matters to us is the number of
students that are getting a lot of value
out of the course and you know we should
have those numbers than in the course
and I think I'd certainly like to
release them I think we'll be able to at
this point we don't really have a
meaningful number that we can delete and
the course isn't over yet I mean we
really still new students joining at and
and we hope new students will keep
joining and still be able to catch up in
course um so we have a text question
so okay so there's a text with can they
see the check question right I all Amish
and say this is from y-dna yba I'm not
sure how to pronounce that if they're
actually here maybe they can tell us and
the question is about could we cover
some debugging topics and approaches in
the recorded office hours and that's
definitely an important question is how
do you do bug code and I think it's
pretty hard to learn debugging so the
best way I can think of to learn
debugging is to do things so you can
observe what your codes doing so to
figure out what's wrong often just
printing out what's going on to see you
know if the problems get more complex
like they did in homework 2 there are
many stages along the way the way to
debug is to test each stage one part at
a time and that could be done just with
Prince if you print out what you want to
be there you can check that you have to
be careful to remember to remove those
prints when you submit the homework at
least for problems where the goal is to
print something out that will prevent it
from being graded correct if you forget
to remove them but just to do things
where you know you're really thinking
like a detective that you're trying to
do observations and set up things where
you can learn as much about what's going
right and what's going wrong about your
code to isolate what the problem is
figure out you know be confident that
you know this is correct and then you're
looking at the next step often where
things take the most time is when you
assume the first step is correct and
spend all your time trying to figure out
what's wrong with the second step but
really the first step wasn't correct and
the second step was fine so that's where
you know being careful in testing as you
go and doing things in small steps is
really what makes it easier and as the
problems get more complex it's really
necessary to bring him the keys isolates
the problem I mean we see a lot of
people starting to program they write
the function it doesn't work and the
response as well it doesn't work and the
their intuition is to start over kind of
just become frustrated which it is
frustrating and so you really got to
start printing out your variables as
thick as you go through i know that this
should equal this and yet having look
they want to be cinematic like like
where people get frustrated and it
doesn't work to solve the problem is
usually if you
start trying random things and seeing if
it works and that's tempting because you
it is frustrating when it doesn't work
but that rarely helps you solve the
problem that it's much better to try to
be systematic and do things in small
steps</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
