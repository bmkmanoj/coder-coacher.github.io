difference learning it helps to have a
little bit of context about
reinforcement learning in a more general
way so we can see how the the different
methods for doing reinforcement learning
fit together okay so I'm going to think
about reinforcement learning this way
remember we talked about SARS is right
the state action reward sequence so I'm
in a state I take an action I get a
reward back I end up in a new state I've
taken new action I get a new reward and
this just continues so I put a little
clean e star after it to indicate that
this is some sequence of state action
rewards that's what comes as input to a
reinforcement learning algorithm and
what the reinforcement learning
algorithm produces as output is a policy
sure that makes it got a quick
notational question for you though sure
should I really be a cleaning star
should it be a plus well I'm being a
little bit laxed with notation here but
I'm imagining that even if you give a
reinforcement learning algorithm no
history at all it could still come out
with an initial policy sure that makes
sense in fact I guess that's true for
every algorithm we've ever talked about
I think so I mean it sorted just be a
default policy like in all state to take
whatever the first action is but but the
fact the matter is over time and the
interesting case is when we've had some
amount of history and we're trying to
map that to some behavior okay I'm on
the same page</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
