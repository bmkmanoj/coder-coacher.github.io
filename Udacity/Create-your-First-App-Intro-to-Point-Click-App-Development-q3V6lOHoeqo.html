things you were talking about those are
the extra tabs for us to be able to you
know load some files runs make some
reports on festivals if we want to but
what about in the upper right hand
corner you can see that we are in our
festival application if we were to
toggle between any of the other apps it
would change the different tabs that we
see because what are these other apps
those are just the standard ones that
come out of the box with your developer
edition account sure are we gonna use
those here we're not gonna use them no
probably not but you can see how you can
track different types of data relevant
to that app so in sales its accounts
contacts that kind of stuff okay so a
festival app right stay focused let's
create any festival okay how oh right
 the new button yeah good there's a
lot of button sorry festival name what
do you think any good idea for a fake
festival name clouds doc cloud stack
that's a good one okay say quit stack
and clouds save so that's pretty awesome
you know it's it's storing information
about cloud stock already has some other
fields that we didn't even create
ourselves like who was it created by and
who was the last modified by I don't see
so he created by oh yeah over here owner
or last modified might got you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
