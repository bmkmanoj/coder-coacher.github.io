recognized value at least in the u.s.
essentially everyone accepts it but even
in other parts of the world many people
accept us cash it is easy to transfer
you don't need to go to a bank or even
interact with a bank in order to be able
to transfer cash between individuals
it's sort of anonymous and untraceable
and I didn't check this one it's
definitely not designed to be
untraceable right each bill has a unique
number in it and you could trace that
number it's untraceable in practice
because people don't tend to record
those bill numbers but it's not
untraceable technically and it's really
the case when banks are robbed and
there's a sequence of bills that were
marked in the same order well that's one
of the ways those bills might be
detected it's not light and portable the
largest currency in the u.s. is a
100-dollar bill and that weighs the same
as a one-dollar bill which weighs about
a third of a gram that means if you can
carry one kilogram that's only 2740
bills which will be over a quarter
million dollars not a bad amount of
money for an individual to carry around
but it certainly could become a factor
if you're talking about large corporate
transactions where one kilogram weighs a
quarter of a million dollars this is one
of many reasons why very few large cash
transactions are done and you see scenes
in movies where someone needs a whole
briefcase full of money in order to do
things the last question whether it's
hard to copy or Forge and I think the
answer this is also really know that
it's just paper the reason that it works
is that the penalties for getting caught
copying or forging are high so the real
answer is that it is hard to copy our
forge in large quantities without
getting caught enforcement of
counterfeiting is taken very seriously
it's done by the Secret Service that's
also responsible for protecting the
president and the only people who can
get away with forging US currency and
large quantities are hostile countries
where US law doesn't reach</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
