profile through the eyes of a recruiter
this is Scott mosses profile he's a
software engineer here at Udacity over
on the left is the personal information
a picture with a friendly smile can help
recruiters make a connection with you
but it isn't mandatory if you aren't
using a picture of yourself be sure to
include a picture that somehow captures
your personality but nothing crude below
is some general information and a link
to Scotts Twitter account recruiters can
look through Scott's tweets to get a
sense of the things he's interested in
similarly I have a link to my personal
blog also make sure your username is
something professional like your name
it's not a good idea to name yourself
after your favorite pop star okay back
to Scotts profile over here we see a
list of Scott's most popular
repositories these are ranked by the
number of stars which are given by other
github users that like the repository
the descriptions are nice so that we
know what these repositories are for to
the right is a list of other
repositories that Scott has contributed
to this is a clear indication that he is
involved in collaborating with others on
open source software employers can look
through Scott's contributions to judge
how well he works on a team we can see
that in GFX is really popular we'll take
a look at it later down here is the
contribution chart this is one of the
first things the hiring manager is going
to look at each square is a day the
darkness of the green indicates how many
contributions were made on that day you
can see that Scott is very active making
at least one contribution most days it's
pretty clear that Scott spends a lot of
time working with code a good sign to a
recruiter</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
