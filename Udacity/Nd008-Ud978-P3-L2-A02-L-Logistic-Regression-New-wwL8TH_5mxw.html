basic forms of regression modeling is
part of a family of generalized linear
models our GLM for short which basically
means that the formula is very similar
to that of a linear regression however
since the target variable is in
categories instead of a continuous
numeric variable the target variable has
to be modified to fit this GLM formula
let's go back and revisit that formula
from less than 1 for a moment
Patrick presented the linear regression
formula that you see on the screen here
as a reminder in this equation Y is the
target variable beta naught is the
intercept or the baseline value and B 1
or beta 1 beta 2 beta 3 all the way to
beta n represents the coefficients for
the different variables X 1 X 2 X 3 all
the way to X and as well so let's
compare this formula to one of the
logistic regression formulas and yep
there are actually more than one of them
let's first focus on the right hand side
of the equation the right hand side of
the equation is actually identical to
that of a linear regression where again
beta naught represents the intercept or
the baseline value beta 1 beta 2 beta 3
all the way up to beta and again
represents the coefficients of the
variables X 1 X 2 X 3 again all the way
to xn now what is going on the left-hand
side of the equation
well don't be scared this is clearly
where the logistic regression separates
from that of a linear regression but
actually it is conceptually very similar
what we are trying to do is find the
probability of P which represents an
outcome like in our example P represents
the probability of yes they will redeem
the natural log is also in this equation
to deal with the binary nature of this
problem</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
