and use gamma correction on it as a post
process I mentioned that there's a
problem with trying to gamma correct if
you have just 8 bits per channel
let's put a number on it your job is to
figure out that number say we walk
through all possible channel levels 0
through 255 and gamma correct each value
here's an example for an input of 1
there are a few steps to convert a
channel first you convert to a
floating-point number by dividing by 255
then use the gamma correction value to
raise it to a power convert back to the
range 0 through 255 by multiplying by
255 then round the fraction to get the
channel number if the input is 0 this
converts to 0 on output no surprises
there with 1 we jumped up to a level of
21 on output level 2 jumps to 28 at
these lower levels we have to boost the
output considerably to get the
equivalent gamma corrected value for
display out of the first 29 output
levels 0 through 28 we've used only 3
already there are 26 levels out of 255
we'll never use
on the low end some levels are never
used on the high end you can have the
opposite that a number of different
input levels mapped to a single output
level the question to you is how many
unique output levels are there I'm
expecting an integer value and it's
clearly less than 256 use whatever means
you like to figure out this answer any
programming language you like this is an
actual real live programming assignment
I personally wrote a little JavaScript
program I used this bit of code to show
me in the debug console the answer it
computed</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
