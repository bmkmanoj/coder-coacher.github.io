new browser technologies cannot break
old websites once the site has been
built with stable web standard
technologies it should continue to work
forever HTML CSS and JavaScript have
evolved quite a bit we're currently on
HTML version 5 hence the five there and
we're also on CSS version 3 notice the
three and we usually call these html5
and css3 each new version has added new
features to the markup languages but few
if any at all features have been removed
so any website written for browsers in
94-95 or really anytime should look
exactly the same on browsers developed
in 2016 as a result of adding more and
more features to these languages there
are lots of ways to solve problems on
the web and here are just a few that
you'll be learning about soon but over
time best practices change but that
doesn't mean that yesterday's best
practices just stop working overnight
part of being a web developer is staying
up-to-date and being able to discern old
from new or last year's gold standard
from tomorrow's tech now to be fair with
these examples in particular all of
these are very very valid ways to
develop websites but there are some
differences and some features are newer
than others in fact web technologies are
constantly changing new ones are popping
up all the time and even the stable ones
are changing on a scale of weeks it
seems like and as I said before we can't
possibly teach you everything that there
is to know about the worldwide web
technologies instead we want to teach
you how to stay up-to-date we want you
to develop opinions about new
technologies as they come out and we
want you to keep learning so that you
keep having fun and you keep building
websites</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
