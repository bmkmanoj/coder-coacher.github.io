controllers and storyboard we're going
to build and make your own adventure app
it will look like this it begins with
the first line of a story and the user
gets to choose what happens next so here
we've got a tiger and I think she should
stalk to the door and peek down the
Holloway so we pressed that button and
it leads to the next part of the story
let's work through the steps to make
this app even though this app will have
multiple views I'm starting with the
single view template because it's the
simplest the first thing I'll do is
delete this view controller that was
automatically generated then I'll drag
in a navigation controller if you look
in this automatically generated root
view controller you'll see that it has a
table view but we don't need a table
view for this app so let's go ahead and
delete that as well then drag in another
view controller and we're going to set
that to be the root view controller I do
that by bringing up the pop-up menu for
the navigation controller and dragging
this root view controller property to
this view controller I just brought in
then I drag in a text view for the story
text and two buttons for the choices
making sure to set the appropriate
constraints of course this view is the
first in a series that have the same UI
components so once I've got this text
view and these buttons set up the way I
like them I'm just going to copy and
paste the whole view controller I can do
that by drawing a rectangle around the
view controller like this
careful that second view controller
appears right on top but it is there
once we have our two new view
controllers we can add some more text
for the next part of the story to segue
from one screen to the next I bring up
the connections menu for each button and
add a triggered segue like this
let's run it and see what we've got so
far hmm I'm getting a black screen
that's not what I want but I have a
guess at why it's happening I need to
make sure my navigation controller is
set as the initial view controller so I
go into my attributes inspector and I
click this is initial view controller
let's try it again okay much better so
you can see I need to adjust my
constraints a little bit on the buttons
but we've got a good start to our story
now repeat these steps on your own and
for more details and notes on how to
polish up the app consult the upcoming
