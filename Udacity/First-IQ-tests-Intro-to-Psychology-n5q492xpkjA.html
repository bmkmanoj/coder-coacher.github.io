is it's hard to both define and measure
but it has been measured and tested for
over a hundred years the first person to
do this was alfred Binet in 1903 he was
looking for a measure that he could give
to all students in the Paris School
District to assess who was struggling
Binet did some things are still used
today
he started with simple problems that got
more difficult as the test went on now
he gave this test of thousands of
children to see what was the normal or
average score for the different age
groups now years later in the 1920s
other psychologists built and developed
two the first intelligence quotient the
IQ this is when the IQ actually got its
name they started with the mental age of
each child they were looking at what age
most children stopped solving problems
of a certain difficulty so if you solve
problems that most seven-year-old solve
but not most six-year-olds then you have
a mental age of seven this is regardless
of your chronological age but they did
also look at your chronological age or
how old you are in years taking these
two things together your mental age and
chronological age made up the first IQ
ratios so your IQ was defined as your
mental age over your chronological age
times 100 which was the average and that
gave you your IQ score so for example if
a child had a mental age of 10 in a
chronological age of 10 then their IQ
would be 100 and this is the average for
her age in fact 100 is always the
average of IQ but if a ten-year-old was
solving problems at a twelve-year-old
level then his or her IQ would be a
hundred and twenty which is above the
normal IQ score likewise if a
ten-year-old child could only solve
problems at an eight-year-olds level
their IQ would be eighty which is just
below the norm people who are scoring
above 100 are scoring at a higher
intellectual level than most of the
population people that are scoring less
than 100 are scoring at a lower
intellectual level than most of the
popular</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
