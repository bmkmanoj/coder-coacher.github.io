architecture that I'd like to mention
for a minute just so that if we come
across them later you know what I was
intending the first one is conceptual
architecture obviously there were
conceptual connotes that it's vague or
high-level the reason it's vague or
high-level is that it's often produced
very early in the development process in
fact before you may even have a complete
idea of what the requirements are
conceptual architectures are often
produces a way to begin the planning
process okay by having an idea of what
at a very high level the components and
connectors are going to be you can begin
to block out what the teams might look
like and how long it's going to take to
produce the ultimate program a pair of
other terms to be aware of is the as
intended versus the as built
architecture during the planning process
the architectural planning process in
which the architectural team decides on
what the architecture is going to be and
produces some documentation for that the
result is the as intended architecture
however during the course of actual
construction of the program something
else may be built and we'll call that
the as-built architecture there are
several reasons why the ads built may
not match ideally with the as intended
it may be the case for example that
during the course of refinement the
development team comes across a
available component whether it's open
source or from another group that can
shortcut the development process by
providing some new functionality but
that additional piece may not match
identically with what was intended in
the architectural plan this process by
which the as intended becomes the
as-built it's sometimes called
architectural drift and if it happens
during software maintenance that is
after the program is released and the
maintenance team then is dealing with
bugs and enhancement suggestions the
term is sometimes called architectural
erosion this may arise because the
maintenance team under time pressure to
get the fixes out to the customers
may not make the ideal fix that would be
done if the original development were
done in a way that was aware of this
particular problem or enhancement and
perhaps also didn't go back and make the
appropriate changes to the architectural
documentation</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
