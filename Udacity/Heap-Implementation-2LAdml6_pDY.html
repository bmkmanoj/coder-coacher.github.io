implementation of a heap though heaps
are represented as trees they are
actually often stored as a race how is
that possible well since we know how
many children each parent has - and thus
how many notes will be at each level we
can use a little math to figure out
where the next node will fall in the
array and then traverse the tree let's
convert this sorted array into a tree we
know that the first element is going to
be the root since it's the biggest the
next two elements in the array are the
children of the root by convention I
insert them from left to right however
that doesn't really matter as long as
they're on the second level again each
level on the tree is twice as big as the
one before it so we know the next level
has four elements we can do this
programmatically by tracking the size of
each level in a variable then doubling
it each time we move to a new level and
everything left over fills in the left
side of the last level now you're done
just a quick note not every array can be
represented as a heap this one could
because it was sorted in descending
order
in general the numbers need to be in an
order that will make sense on a heap
storing our data in an array can save us
some space if we use an array we just
need to store the node value and index
in the array slot however if we created
some kind of node object for a tree each
would need pointers to children and
parents so we need to store values and a
bunch of pointers for every element
since the array saves us the pointers it
saves a space</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
