analysis in a little more detail as I
said earlier traditional analysis and
design techniques were functionally
oriented what that means is that it
concentrated on the functions to be
performed where's the data upon which
the functions operated were secondary to
the functions themselves
conversely object-oriented analysis is
primarily concerned with the data
objects so we went from a functional
oriented view to a data oriented view
what the means is that during the
analysis phase with the finest system
first in terms of the data types in
their relationships and the functions or
methods are defined only later and
associated with specific objects which
are sets of data so let's see how we can
perform object-oriented analysis in
practice so the basic idea is to be
focused on the objects of the real world
so to go from a real world object to a
set of requirements and we can describe
this as a fourth step process the first
step is to obtain or prepare a textual
description of the problem to be solved
so obviously we need to start from some
description of the system that we need
to build and this is a very practical
oriented approach so that the next thing
we do is that we take the description
and we underline nouns in this
description and the announced that we
underlined will become classes in my
analysis we then look at the objectives
in the document we underline those and
we use that information to identify the
attributes of the classes that we
previously identified at this point we
focus on active verbs in the description
and the analysis of the active verbs
will give us the operations that we need
to define for our classes so again
underlined nouns and those will become
the classes in my system then adjectives
and those will be the attributes of the
classes and finally active verbs that
will become the operations on my classes
and of course this is a high-level view
to take this with a grain of salt but we
will see that it's a very good pragmatic
approach to identifying requirements
starting from a description of the
system to be built</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
