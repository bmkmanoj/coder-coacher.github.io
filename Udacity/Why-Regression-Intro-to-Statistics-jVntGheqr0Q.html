question about regression that will
straight why regression got its name why
is this thing that gets us the best fit
of a line what does that have to do with
regression going backwards so I'd like
you to tell me for any two variables x
and y if they're not perfectly related
that is if the absolute value of their
correlation is not one how extreme is
our Y prediction compared to X and by
extreme to be a little more precise I
mean this if we have X so we have some
observation in the X's say right here
and we have a total probability that's
denoted by this little shaded region
that a given X I is either at that value
or above farther away from the mean or
here farther away in this direction and
we can map that to a Y using a
regression equation and we'll get a
value in the Y distribution and it will
have again some probability of being
that value or more extreme and the
smallness of that probability is what we
mean by extremity so 1% chance is more
extreme than a 40% chance one in a
million is more extreme than one in a
thousand so what I'd like you to tell me
is will Y be more extreme will Y be as
extreme will Y be less extreme or it
depends on the data
please check the right answer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
