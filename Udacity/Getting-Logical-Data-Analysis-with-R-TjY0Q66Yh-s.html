visualizations to examine the
distribution of a single variable and we
also looked at transforming a variable
to get a better look at the data now
there are other ways that we can
transform a variable besides using
something like the square root or a log
you often want to convert variables that
have a lot of 0 values to a new binary
variable that has only true or false
this is helpful because we may want to
know whether our user has used a certain
feature at all instead of the number of
times that the user says actually use
that feature for example it may not
matter how many times a person checked
in using a mobile device but whether the
person has ever used mobile check in
here's what I mean here's a summary of
the mobile likes in our data set
the median is 4 which means that we have
a lot of zeros in our data set if I run
this summary I'm gonna get a different
type of table notice that in the table I
get logical counts because I use this
comparison operator I wanted to see
whether or not someone had actually
checked in so instead of tracking the
count of mobile likes let's create a new
variable that tracks mobile check-ins
we'll call this variable mobile check-in
the first thing I'll do is assign it a
bunch of n/a values next we can use the
if-else function to assign a value of 1
if the user has checked in using mobile
and a value of 0 if the user has not
checked in
so in this if-else statement if this
condition is true we'll assign our user
a value of 1 otherwise we'll give them a
value of 0 and the last thing I'll do is
convert it to a factor variable running
this code I get my new variable saved
and then taking a summary of the results
I can see that about 64,000 just shy of
that have checked in using mobile or
35,000 have not so using this data can
you tell me what percent of users check
in using mobile try to use actual code
here instead of using these raw numbers
round your answer to the nearest percent
and don't include the percent sign when
you enter it here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
