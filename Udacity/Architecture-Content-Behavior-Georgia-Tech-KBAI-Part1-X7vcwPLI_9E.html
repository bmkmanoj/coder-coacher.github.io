behind work on cognitive architectures
by a simple equation architecture +
content equals behavior let us look at
this equation from two different
perspectives first imagine that you want
to design an intelligent machine that
exhibits a particular kind of behavior
this equation says that in order to do
that you have to design the right
architecture and then put the right kind
of knowledge content into that
architecture to get the behavior that
you want from it that's a complicated
thing but suppose that I could fix the
architecture for you in that case if the
architecture is fixed I simply have to
change in knowledge content to get
different behaviors which is a very
powerful idea from a different direction
suppose that we are trying to understand
human behavior now we could say again if
the architecture is fixed we could say
that this behavior is arising because
the knowledge content is different we
can map now behavior to content because
the architecture is fixed that
simplifies our understanding of how to
design machines or how to understand
human cognition by the way the same
thing happens in computer architecture
I'm sure your family with computer
architecture computer architecture has
stored program Senate District content
and that running of the short program
gives you different behaviors the
computer architecture doesn't change the
stored program keeps on changing give
you different kind of behaviors same
idea with cognitive architectures give
the architecture constant change the
content now of course the big question
will become what is a good architecture
and that's what we'll examine later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
