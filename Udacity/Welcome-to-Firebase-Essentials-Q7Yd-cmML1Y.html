well thanks I was actually super nervous
when they called shopping list plus plus
I just kind of panicked may I yeah sure
how is this now I can personalize
everything this is amazing yeah it's a
lot heavier than you'd think it'd be
yeah hey have you had one of these
macaroons no I actually haven't eaten
anything all day I would kill for an
instigator right now well I think
Walters at the store if it was always
some way we could contact him oh hey we
could use the app of course here my
phone open and I'll just go ahead and
scroll through my shopping list and
Walter is in the story that's awesome so
let's go ahead and add instead delicious
insta read oh wow looks like he picked
it up yeah that's super fast oh hey and
what about right let's teach this class
yeah hey hello there and welcome to
firebase essentials for Android my name
is JP and I'm a program manager for
Google with developer training more
recently I've been involved with
Google's cloud courses on Udacity and hi
I'm Lila I'm an Android course developer
at Udacity I've worked on developing
Android apps as well as Android for
beginners so by now you probably guessed
that Lila and her team are the creators
of shopping lists plus plus the wildly
successful collaborative shopping list
app written in firebase you've recently
seen it in action when Walter Lila's
roommate ordered us a mr. Ito right but
what you don't know is how we got here
in this five lesson course you will take
on the role of shopping list plus pluses
first developer higher and in doing so
you're gonna help us integrate the
Android app with a firebase back-end
if you don't know what firebase is it's
a platform for building mobile and web
applications where you can read data
create authentication methods and also
configure security and permissions for
your data when you're done you're gonna
know how to create a app with a back-end
that can support something like a chat
application or Google Docs or even the
backend for a multi-user game
yeah and I'll be collaborating with Lila
discussing firebase theory I'll also
introduce some examples and you can use
when you're building your project and
I'm the courses app architect which
means that I'll be walking you through
the code examples and talking about sort
of design issues with you I'll also ask
you to do implement features for the app
so you might be wondering what exactly
do you need to know to begin this course
well basically you need to be able to
build Android apps to connect to the
internet and read data you also need to
understand the Android lifecycle and UI
specifically elements of responsive
design and you should know github and
get repos basically if you've completed
the developing Android apps and
completed the project for that course
you should be fine
mm-hmm and there's actually a couple of
things that you do not need to know for
this course for example you don't need
to know how to configure servers or do
anything with backends so if I have one
question what if students want to know
if this course is really for them well
that's a great question and actually we
thought of that so we typed up a full
list of prerequisites and you can go
ahead and check out the instructor notes
for those so I think with that maybe
this is a good time to take a trip down
memory lane and go back in time and see
how everything began</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
