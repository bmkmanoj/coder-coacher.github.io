will use the same test bed throughout
this lesson which is based on the screen
saver we built last level now instead of
the ball just moving in a straight line
forever will control its movement with
key prices touches and the accelerometer
let's explore the testbed a bit first
our application listener is called input
test bed and it extends game the only
thing we have to do in this file is set
the game screen which we set to a new
instance of ball screen let's check that
out next ball screen is responsible for
setting up a place to draw and then
delegates all the logic about what the
ball actually does to this bouncing ball
class ball screen extends screen adapter
which is a convenience implementation of
the screen interface screen adapter
provides blank implementations of all
the screens required methods which means
we can just override the ones that were
interested in there's a few new things
here the first of which is this auto
shape type when shape renderer is in
auto shape type mode that means we can
change shape types in the middle of a
batch this is incredibly convenient when
you are passing your shape renderer into
other objects to use for drawing note we
use an extend viewport to make the
shortest axis of the world equal to
world size also note that every time the
window is resized we just reset the ball
then down here and render we do all the
normal stuff applying the viewport
clearing the screen setting the
projection matrix then we tell the ball
to update itself we start a shape
renderer batch and we tell the ball to
go ahead and draw itself using our shape
renderer let's check out what the ball
is doing so this bouncing ball class is
quite long and i encourage you to just
open up this demo in the course code and
check it out for yourself the behavior
of this ball should be pretty familiar
from the screensaver example there are
two new things drag and the periodic
kicks that the ball receives to show off
that drag down here and update if it's
been sufficiently long since we last
gave the ball a kick then we go ahead
and give the ball a new cake and here's
where we apply drag every frame the
velocity is reduced by an amount
proportional to the current velocity
let's see all this in action so we see
we've got a little red ball
occasionally gets kicked in a random
direction then it slowly comes to a stop
it kind of looks like an air hockey
table and if we resize it it just resets
itself to the middle all right so this
is fun but it's not interactive yet well
let's fix that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
