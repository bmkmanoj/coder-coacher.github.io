first of all assertions take time if for
every single operation are large data
structure you traverse the entire tree
in order to check it for consistency
these operations will no longer
algorithmic time but at least linear
time a check on a square root result
will not matter that much but if you
need to traverse large data structures
it will this is why assertions can be
turned off the way assertions are being
turned on and off differs from the
language you use in Python there's a
minus Big O option which turns
assertions of minus big o stands for
optimized in c c++ the compiler option-
Big D and debug for no debugging also
turns assertion of in Java there's an
option minus EA for enabled assertion
which turns assertions on Java special
by having assertions turned off by
default not very surprisingly the assert
keyword in Java is the least frequently
used of all keywords in Java which in my
view is a big big shame the fact that
assertions can be turned off and
frequently will also implies that that
assertions must not change the program
semantics whether assertions are turned
on or turned off the behavior of the
program should be the same suppose
you're developing this cool map
application which also supports setting
pins for individual locations now you
want to make sure that if you remove a
location the appropriate function
returns the right value so just remove
it it now if you write assert map remove
location equals to true in order to make
sure that remove location returns a true
value that's dangerous because if the
assertion is turned off here then not
only does the check go away but actually
also the call to remove generally
speaking if anything in your assertion
has side effects such as this one don't
put it into the assertion what you do
instead is you put the functionality
into code that is outside of the
assertion and then use the assertion
only for checking the result this way if
the assertion is turned off has no
effect then the semantics of the pro
will so be unchanged except that the
checks will be gone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
