bivariate relationship between price and
carat weight but there's much more to
this data set and I'd like to give it a
proper introduction the diamonds data
set chips with ggplot2 and contains the
prices and the specs for more than 50
thousand diamonds collected in 2008 from
diamond SC info now analyzing this data
is particularly useful because diamonds
are unique in a way that just isn't true
of most manufactured products that were
used to buying you can't just plug in
the model number and look up the price
the of the diamonds data set is full of
prices and fairly esoteric certification
ratings hidden in the data are
reflections of how a legendary marketing
campaign permeated and was subsumed by
our culture hints about how different
social strata responded and how the
diamond market functions today as a
result the story starts in 1870 when
many tons of diamonds were discovered in
South Africa near the Orange River until
then the diamond market had been small
only a few pounds of diamonds were mined
each year from India and Brazil at the
time there was no use for diamonds
outside of jewelry so price depended
only on scarce supply
hence the project's investors formed the
DeBeers cartel in 1888 to try to control
the global price of diamonds by most
accounts this has been the most
successful cartel in history but World
War one and the Great Depression saw
diamond sales plummet in 1938 the De
Beers cartel contacted Philadelphia ad
agency and W iron son to inquire whether
quote the use of propaganda in various
forms might help jump-start diamond
sales in the US which looked like the
only potentially viable market for
diamonds at the time survey showed hover
that among couples contemplating
marriage diamonds were low on the list
of priorities a luxury for the rich
money down the drain
Frances Gerety took on the De Beers
account at MW iron son and worked toward
the company's goal to quote create a
situation in which every couple
contemplating marriage feels the need to
acquire a diamond engagement ring a few
years later she would coin a famous
slogan</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
