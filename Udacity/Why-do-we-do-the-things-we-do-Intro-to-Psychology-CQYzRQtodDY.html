general psychology course or why did I
take 12 months of training to try to get
to the top of Half Dome at Yosemite
National Park why did you wait line for
3 hours to see the new Star Trek film or
why did I order a double cheeseburger
and chocalate shake even though I know
they're not good for me
well maybe the cheeseburger makes me
feel good so emotion can play a role or
maybe I ordered it because I was just
plain hungry well in order to do all the
things that student just talks about
you're going to need motivation and
that's exactly what we're going to talk
about in this lesson first we're going
to start with talking about the theories
of motivation then we'll talk about how
motivations actually drive our behaviors
and we're going to end the lesson by
talking about emotion that's right now
the word motivation comes from the Latin
verb which means to move and so here
we're interested in our movements and
actions and what determines those
movements and actions and now Lauren is
going to start talking a little bit
about motivation in depth let's go do
that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
