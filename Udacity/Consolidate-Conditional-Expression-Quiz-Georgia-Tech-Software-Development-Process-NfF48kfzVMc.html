consolidate conditional expression
refactoring a common situation in coda
is that you have a set of conditioners
with the same result what that means
that sometimes the code contains a
series of conditional checks in which
each check is different yet the result
in action is the same in these cases the
code could be improved that by combining
the conditionals using for example and
an ORS connectors so as to have a single
conditional check with a single result
at that point you can also extract those
conditional into a metal and replace the
conditional with a call to that method
consolidating the conditional code in
this way can make the checks clearer by
showing that you're really making a
single check rather than multiple checks
and extracted that condition and having
a metal instead of a condition can
clarify your code by explaining why you
are doing a given check rather than how
you're doing it
you can see an example of that situation
in this code which is the disability
amount method as the name of the method
says the purpose of this code is to
compute a disability amount for a given
for example employee and there is a set
of initial checks in the method whose
goal is to decide whether there's this
disability amount should be instead 0
and as you can see there's multiple
conditions for example there's a check
about the seniority level about the
number of months that the employee is
being disabled so far whether the
employee is part-time and the outcome of
all this check is always the same if
they're true if the check is satisfied
then there's no disability math so the
disability amount is zero so what I will
do if I apply the consolidate
conditional expression to this method is
that I will take this three conditionals
I will put them together by saying
basically that if seniority is less than
two or months disabled is greater than
12 or is per time is true then the
return should be zero and once have this
combined conditional as I say here I
will just extract that into a method</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
