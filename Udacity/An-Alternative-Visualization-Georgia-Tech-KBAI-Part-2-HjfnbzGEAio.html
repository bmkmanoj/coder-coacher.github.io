concept learning makes sense to you here
it is under the way of visualizing that
algorithm imagine that an AI agent was
given a positive example and the AI
agent may come up with a concept
definition that covers a positive
example now let us suppose that the air
agent is given a negative example and
this negative example is covered by the
current concept definition well in that
case the current concept definition must
be defined in such a way then the
negative example is excluded while still
including the positive example so you
can visualize a new concept definition
which includes a positive example it
excludes the negative example now let a
supposedly AI agent is given another
positive example in which case the AI
agent must revise its definition of the
concept so that the new positive example
is also included so let's also covered
so we may revise this concept definition
something like this we can repeat this
exercise many times imagine there is a
negative example and the current concept
definition covers it where we can refine
it in such a way to the new negative
example is excluded and so on we can
imagine going through several of these
iterations of positive and negative
examples eventually we will get a
concept definition that includes that
covers all the positive examples and
excludes all the negative examples so
again the problem is the same given a
small set of positive negative examples
the number of dimensions in which the
algorithm can do generalization of
specializations is very large how do how
do we constrain the learning in this
complex learning space this will lose
heuristics and background knowledge come
in those heuristics guide the algorithm
so that revises the concept definition
in a efficient manner and the background
knowledge helps in that process</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
