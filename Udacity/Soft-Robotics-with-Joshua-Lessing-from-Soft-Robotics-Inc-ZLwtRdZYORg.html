director of research and development at
soft robotics so I have a rather
unconventional start in robotics I'm
actually a chemist by training and I
came into robotics when I started my
post doctoral work with Professor George
Whitesides at Harvard University and
George Whitesides he is one of the
world's most famous chemists and he not
only does work in chemistry he really
just does work in anything that he finds
interesting he's very very innovative
and so when when I was in his lab he was
you know doing robotics he was doing
composites molecular electronics water
protein interactions the origins of life
even anything that that he finds
interesting he works on and he builds
these cross-functional teams that are
designed to come up with new ways of
thinking about age-old problems so in
the case of soft robotics he had people
who were chemists like myself chemical
engineers people who understood
biomechanics you name it most of which
were not conventional roboticists try to
think about what would be a new way of
building a robot and where we got to was
you know if you build robots out of
rubbers and plastics and and other kind
of squishy materials liquids you get
robots that you know astoundingly have
all these new properties that are very
very interesting so that was some of the
stuff that I worked on in his in his lab
and when it came time to commercialize
the technology I left - to start that
here with soft robotics I've spent my
career trying to do bio-inspired
research so early in my career it was
trying to develop biomimetic catalysts
so that the oil and gas industry could
turn methane into a ways of making nylon
you know later on in my career it was
trying to study the fundamental
molecular properties behind elastin
which is the the rubber that makes up
the soft robots that are peoples and
people and animals and Durham Arcola
materials so you know nature made the
best rubber how do
we how do we replicate it and so moving
here to the work at soft robotics you
know Nature has made the best gripper
ever conceived you know what can we
learn about these biological systems and
how can we incorporate their design
principles and the things that we make
just because you know they're they're
remarkable there there isn't an
incredible amount of computation that
goes into the use of your hand not the
kinds of computations that that most
robot assists are accustomed to in the
systems they built but yet miraculously
you can do far more that with this then
you could with a normal robotic gripper
and part of that is is embedded in the
mechanical design you know the muscles
and the tendons and the bones all the
stuff that's in you know compression all
the stuff that's in in tension you know
that whole mechanical structure a lot of
the smarts are just built into how it
innately responds the environment even
without you know active controls of
moving your muscles so you know what's
exciting for me is having this
possibility of delivering this
astonishing capability of you know
getting ever closer to this style of
grasping through the technology that we
work here to build everyday</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
