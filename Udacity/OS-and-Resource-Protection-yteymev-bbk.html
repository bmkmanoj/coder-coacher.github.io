does is protect resources that need to
be protected how does that work well the
way it works is because we give control
of the resources to the operating system
we say you can directly untrusted
applications can directly access it so
operating system is has control and it's
actually going to control access to
these resources and we know it can do
that because of the complete mediation
requirement we had so anybody who wants
access to such a resource actually has
to come through the operating system and
when they come through the operating
system the operating system is going to
be able to say yeah this is ok or I'm
not going to allow or grant access or
I'm going to deny this particular
request so how does the operating system
actually sort of mediate these requests
that we're going to have for various
resources and that need to be protected
first it must establish who is making
the request what is the source of the
request request always has a source the
entity that is making the request and it
has a target which is the resource that
is being requested so the operating
system has to know who is making the
request and what is being requested so
the who part is typically answered by
this thing we call authentication we're
going to talk more about it in a future
lesson but authentication essentially
establishes on whose behalf a certain
application or the process is running
and so that's the user who's making the
request once we know who is making the
request then we have this thing called
authorization or access control this is
really checking looking up if this
source of the request is allowed to
access the resource for which the
request is being made you may be allowed
to access a certain file or you may not
be able to access a file because it
doesn't belong to you so the check that
we're going to do is called the access
control check so what the trusted
computing base where the operating
system really does it doesn't decide who
accesses a given resource or not that's
called sort of policy you have to decide
who you going to share your
horses with or what other applications
can share a given file that you have so
that's the policy but the fact that when
a request for a resource comes being
able to do that access check the
mechanisms are essentially that part
which intervene between the source of
the request and the check that we're
going to do to determine if the policy
that we have in place is going to tell
us whether the resource can be granted
or not so the mechanism is essentially
this this check that we are performing
and the goal of a trusted computing base
is to implement and do that in a trusted
fashion the checks or have the
mechanisms for doing these checks that
going to allow a variety of policies to
be implemented or supported in the
system the protection of the resources
when you talk about it always we have to
know where the request is coming from
whether the requester is allowed to
access it and that's what the trusted
computing base has to do and it does it
by providing these mechanisms to support
a variety of access control policies</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
