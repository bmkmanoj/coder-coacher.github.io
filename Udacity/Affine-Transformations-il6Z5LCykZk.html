transformation as an example of
something we want to understand and
figure out all the parameters for this
would be an equation we would basically
have these eight parameters that would
change to create an affine warp which
basically means is now have an image
like this which after transformation or
warping would appear to be this way so
now find transformation basically we are
combining linear transformations ones we
looked at that will be you know the
rotation scaling and all of that stuff
with translations so in essence this up
this image is now moved over here and
it's also been warped the properties of
an affine transformation are that origin
does not necessarily map to origin for
example this could be the original
origin of this image we've translated it
and then warped it lines map the lines
if you notice all lines are still lines
here they just changed a little bit but
they're still lines and similarly
parallel lines all remain parallel these
are the basic properties of affine
transformations and one thing if you
notice this could be achieved by
actually modeling these six parameters
so parameters a b c d e f are six
parameters so in essence this is a six
degree of freedom or a presentation and
once we do this now we can actually
figure out the transformation of going
from here to that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
