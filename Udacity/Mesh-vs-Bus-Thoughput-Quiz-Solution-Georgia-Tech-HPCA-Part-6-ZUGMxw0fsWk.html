mesh versus bus throughput quiz where we
had four cores with a totally random and
even distribution of traffic among the
course we are given what each core is
sending we are getting what the bus can
do and what the link in a mesh can do
and now we are asked how much faster is
it on the bus versus on the mesh our bus
cannot sustain the forty million
messages per second that the cores are
trying to give it so the cores are
really gonna slow down to half of their
speed so that the bus bandwidth demand
matches what it can provide so on the
bus
we get to X the execution time that each
core is capable of providing on the mesh
we can support twenty million messages
per second per link so now the question
is do our links get saturated so let's
see what we get on a mesh like this in
terms of traffic each core is generating
ten million messages 3.3 million are
going to each other core so all the ten
million messages sent here one-third are
going to this core one third are going
through this link and then one-third are
going here let's say that one sixth go
this way one sixth go this way so this
link will be used for one sixth of the
messages sent by this core and this one
for another one sixth and then we add
one sixth to each of these which brings
us to one half of ten million messages
so now we are done with this core what
happens from this core same thing this
link gets one half of the messages one
third are going here one sixth are going
here so this link suffers one half of
this traffic again now this link gets
one half of the traffic from this core
and these two links get one sixth each
and now we're done with this core now
what happens when this core is sending
one half of the messages go this way one
half going go this way one sixth of them
go through this link and one sixth go
through this link done with this core
and finally this core sends messages
half here half here and then one sixth
year
and 1/6 year now we are done with this
course so as you can see our links are
actually evenly used each of them gets
to times 1/2 plus 2/6 so we get 1 and
1/3 times the traffic generated by one
core that was what the 1/2 was off the
traffic from one core is 10 million
messages a second so we're really
getting ten plus three point three so
this is thirteen point three million of
messages per second which is available
order on our mesh so the mesh doesn't
slow down the processors so really the
speed-up of using the mesh versus the
bus is two because the bus requires the
course to slow down so that it can
support the traffic that they're
generating while the mesh allows the
course to proceed at full speed at 10
million max messages per second and
still has some traffic left over if we
went to a larger network and four cores
the bus would have to proportionally
slow down while the mesh would get more
links and it will be awhile until any of
the mesh links becomes saturated so
clearly the mesh is far superior to the
bus in terms of the traffic it can
support when we go to more coarse</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
