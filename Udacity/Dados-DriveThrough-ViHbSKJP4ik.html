with the data that we need but to get
that data it looks like we need to
download a complicated form then we
don't result off a map or download a
spreadsheet I'm not sure how we're going
to use this service well why can't we
just embed the spreadsheet into our app
well I think we could but it being an
updating nightmare especially for users
I mean every single time there's new
data we'd have to redownload the
spreadsheet recompile the app and
republish it to Google Play not to
mention every single time there was new
data users would also have to update
their apps every single time we updated
which was like daily yeah talk about a
poor experience hmm that is a problem
well perhaps we'll just have our appt
pick up some drive through data what do
you mean get this you can think of a
data source like a fast-food restaurant
you know the kind with indoor seating
and a drive-through okay you see when
you're not sure what you want at a
restaurant you play want to go inside
look at the menu talk to the staff and
they'll take care of bringing the food
to you okay but when you know exactly
what food you want you're probably okay
going through the drive through making a
precise order and getting your food
returned to you all nicely packaged up
at the pickup window are you sir we're
still talking about earthquakes
absolutely for example when you navigate
to the usgs website and fill out the
form querying for what earthquakes you
want that's like going in and sitting
down at the restaurant you're getting
the human from the experience okay I got
you but if you're another computer
program or an app that wants to use data
from USGS then there's the drive-thru
window you see you can customize a
request for data and it gets returned to
you in a simple format that a program
can easily understand hmm let me think
about that so you mean there's dinan
data for humans and drive through data
for apps absolutely and the drive-thru
window is kind of like an application
programming interface oh right an API so
it's basically a way for another
application to talk to a service via
code yeah so burgers absolutely let me
call let's do it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
