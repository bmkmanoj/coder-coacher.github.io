with a subset of leaf case prescription
as I mentioned just now in the sense
that nucleus managers only threads and
IPC the abstractions available in
nucleus are the following there is this
domain a domain is similar to UNIX
process it's a container or an address
space and threads can execute in a
particular domain these threads are
similar in semantics to P thread that we
have seen before and this abstraction
called door is a software capability to
a domain it's you can think of it as
this real-life analogy of opening a door
in order to get into a room in a similar
manner if you have a handle to the door
you can open the door and enter a target
domain so that's the idea behind door so
any domain can create these nucleus
entities called doors which are
essentially entry points for entering
the target domain with the object
orientation I told you that the only
thing that you can do is make
invocations on objects and the entry
points available in the objects that are
contained in a domain are represented by
this abstraction called door that's
provided by nucleus let's say I'm a file
server what will I do well I have entry
points in my file server such as opening
a file or reading a file writing a file
and so on basically I will create those
entry points as doors into my domain and
now if I'm a client how do I get access
to the entry points that's available in
a target domain
well the way I do that is exactly
similar to how you may be opening a file
in a UNIX file system what you do is an
F open and when you do that you get a
file descriptor which is a small integer
that is a handle for you to access the
file in a similar manner if I'm a client
and if I want the ability to invoke a
target domain a particular entry point
then what I want is an access to this
door and the way I get that is by
getting a door handle so I get a door
handle so every domain will
door table which is similar to the file
descriptors that you may have in a UNIX
process and every door ID that you have
in this door table points to a
particular door if I have a door handle
in my door table for a particular door
what that tells me is that oh I have the
ability to make an invocation in the
target domain that this particular door
corresponds to so the possessor of a
door handle is able to make object
invocations on the target domain using
this door handle and as you can see a
particular client domain can have a door
table that has access to several
different target domains so in this case
these two entries in my door table
points to this door which probably our
entry points into this target domain
another door which are a different set
of entry points and I have access to
them as well and multiple clients may
have access to the same door because if
it's a file system for instance you may
be able to access the file system I may
be able to access a file system and so
on so the door table is something that
is unique to every domain and it gives
that domain an ability to access the
entry points in the target domain so
that they can make object invitations so
the way to think about this door it's
basically a software capability to a
domain since we are using object
orientation it is represented by a
pointer to a C++ object that represents
the target domain and door can be passed
from domain to domain which is a
software capability and it can be passed
from domain to domain and when it is
passed from domain to domain it gives
the ability for those domains to
actually get access to the entry points
specified through this door to the
target domain when the spring kernel
itself is a composition of the nucleus
plus the memory management that is
inherent in the fact that these domains
represent an address space now how do
you go about making an object invocation
that is you want to make a protect
procedure call into a target domain from
a client domain how do I do that well
the nucleus is involved in every door
call so I want to open the door
I need the permission of the nucleus and
what I do is when I make the invocation
using the small descriptor that I have
which is the door handle the nucleus
looks at it says okay this domain has
the ability to do this invocation and it
allocates a server thread in the target
domain and executes the invocation that
is indicated by this particular door
handle it's a protected procedure call
and since it is procedure called
semantics the client thread is
deactivated and the thread is allocated
to the target domain so that it can
execute the invocation for the method
that is indicated by this door handle
and on return from this target domain
once that protected procedure call is
complete the thread is deactivated and
the client thread is reactivated so that
the client can continue with whatever it
was doing before so this is very very
similar to the communication mechanism
that we discussed in the lightweight
remote RPC paper before in the sense
that we are doing very fast cross
address based calls using this door
mechanism this protected procedure call
is an illustration of how nucleus make
sure that even though it has an object
based design and it is using object
orientation in the building of the in
this it is using object orientation in
the structuring of the operating system
kernel it ensures that it'll still be
performant in the sense that you can do
this cross domain calls very quickly
through this idea of deactivating the
client thread and quickly activating the
thread to execute the entry point
procedure in the target domain and
unreturned
reactivating the client thread and all
of this results in very fast cross
address based calls through this door
mechanism that's how you make sure that
you get all the good attributes of
object orientation and not sacrifice
on performance at the same time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
