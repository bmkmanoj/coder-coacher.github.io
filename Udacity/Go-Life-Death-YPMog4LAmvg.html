go together
each player may only play one stone at a
time and a group is only captured when
all of their liberties have been
occupied this group of stones has two
inside liberties which might seem okay
for now but if the white player throws
in a stone the group is down to one
Liberty even if the black player
captures the white stone the white
player can immediately play back in that
space to capture all of the black stones
however if we shift half of the stone so
that the two liberties are separated
white can no longer capture any of the
black stones if white tries to play an
ether of the two spots the black stones
will each have one Liberty open and
avoid capture since white can only play
one stone at a time and with suicide by
playing in either spot the black stones
as a whole are considered alive the two
separated territory regions are called
eyes and so the derived rule follows a
group is alive if it has or can make two
eyes consider this black group with
three inside liberties is this group
dead or alive if black plays in the
middle point we can clearly see that
black has created two eyes but what if
it's White's turn to play if white plays
on that same vital point then black
can't react black has no way of dividing
up the region into two separate eyes
white doesn't need to play any further
and will capture all the stones at the
end of the game the fate of this group
with the three size eyespace depends on
who is able to place the first stone if
it's blacks turn it's alive and if it's
White's turn it is dead
what about this case where the black
group has 4 liberties in a straight line
as before black clearly creates two
distinct eyes by placing a stone on
either of these middle points but black
doesn't need to be proactive like before
if white had the first action and placed
a stone on one of these points black
could immediately place their stone on
the other middle point to create two
eyes the only way that white could kill
the black group is
got two turns in a row since players
alternate moves the original position
should be considered alive for black at
the end of the game no further play
needed of course the open space could
still be used as a threat if there is a
KO somewhere on the board if black has
just taken a stone in ko white might
play a stone inside of the eye space to
induce black to play and reaction white
could then go back to the KO and push it
back in their direction
if black ignores the threat instead then
white can play a second move inside the
black group to kill it gaining
compensation for whatever they may have
lost from the KO when it comes to KO
fights it's important to evaluate the
threats available in order to get a good
result good evaluation of ko fights is
difficult because of how difficult it
can be to evaluate how many points a
position is worth positional evaluation
in general is a big consideration when
playing the game when you see your
opponent's move you need to consider if
you need to react to it locally does the
opponent's move threaten the life of a
group if you ignore the move how much
will a second move in the same area hurt
can you make a move that the opponent
needs to react to first before coming
back to the original area getting a good
intuition for the value of each move
will help you take the initiative with
your moves rather than always following
your opponent around alphago has shown a
strong ability to make moves that help
it keep the initiative contributing
greatly to its success in games before
ending this video there is one special
case of life that you should know about
this is an example of dual life or Seki
in this situation the white and black
stones are each surrounded on the
outside and their two inside liberties
are shared by the two groups neither
player actually wants to play a stone on
either Liberty since while it does put
the opponent into Atari it puts the
player's own stones into the same state
since neither player will want to play
inside the space the game will end with
neither of the points counting for
either player
