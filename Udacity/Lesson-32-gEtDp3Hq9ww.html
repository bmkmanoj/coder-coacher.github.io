iconoclast named Danny Hillis was trying
to build a new supercomputer he called
it the connection machine look something
like this you can tell it's a
supercomputer because it's covered in
blinky lights fun fact about these
lights they would actually blink
according to where communication was
happening in the system I don't know why
we don't make computers anymore with
blinky lights we really should anyway
Hilla says PhD dissertation on the
connection machine is one of my all-time
favorites in fact it even won the
doctoral dissertation award from the
Association computing machinery in 1985
that's one of the highest honors a CS
PhD can receive now the kicker is that
it won this award despite its concluding
chapter new computer architectures and
their relationship to physics or why
computer science is no good that's right
the best CS PhD of 1985 poo-pooed the
entire discipline now hillis was
critiquing parallel algorithms research
of the time he argued that at the end of
the day an algorithm has to run on a
physical machine which has to obey the
laws of physics yet algorithms
researchers were in his opinion
abstracting away way too many details
about the physical cost of computation
now hillis was worried about the speed
of light which fundamentally limits how
fast information can travel but today
you could easily imagine the melting
butter experiment as a physical cost
that we largely ignore but should we the
answer is a resounding I don't know but
I do think hillis might have been on to
something so what I want to do in this
lesson is to start from this line of
thinking and ask what would it mean to
consider physical costs in designing an
algorithm</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
