software developers there's already a
Java development kit usually called the
JDK available for download by any
developer on Oracle's website Oracle is
the company that owns Java and their
development kit includes two main tools
one the Java Runtime environment and two
a Java compiler called Java C the Java
runtime environment includes the code
behind all the variable types and
functions that Java has built-in like
the print line function the runtime
environment also includes a java virtual
machine which is basically a
downloadable machine that allows java
code to run on any computer whether it's
a Windows a Mac or another platform and
lots of computers already have the
runtime environment installed because
it's needed to run any java applications
that appear on webpages but to develop
our own programs and java apps we need a
second tool the java compiler a compiler
is a special type of program it
translates code written in a particular
programming language like java into a
form that a computer can actually
understand and run computers at their
most basic level only react to
electronic signals and so seeing code
like a print line statement doesn't mean
much to them the code developers write
has to be translated into machine code
which is usually a series of zeros and
ones that our computer circuitry can
respond to and the compiler is the first
step in translating our java code into
machine code for example the main
compiler for java is called java c and
it's job is to read the java code that
we write and translate it into a
different more compact code called
bytecode and here's the whole
translation pipeline any java code you
write like this hello world print line
statement will get compiled into
bytecode by our Java compiler Java C and
then this bytecode gets passed to the
java virtual machine which does the
final translation step and translates
this into machine code and this is the
code that your computer understands so
then you see the execution of your code
on your computer screen this print
output but you might be wondering why
the compiler doesn't translate your Java
code to machine code
straight away why is there this extra
virtual machine translation step
well the java virtual machine is one of
the coolest things about java because it
works differently depending on the type
of operating system it's on so if it's
on Windows Mac or even a mobile device
all these platforms need slightly
different machine code to work and the
virtual machine will translate bytecode
into the correct machine code for any
platform it's on so Java programs can
run on any device and again the Java
development kit contains both this
virtual machine and a Java compiler Java
C so next you'll see how to download and
install this kit so that you'll have all
you need to start programming on your
own computer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
