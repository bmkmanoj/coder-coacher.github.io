cake problem if 16 of a cake is frosted
with strawberry icing and three-eighths
is frosted with blueberry icing what
fraction of cake is not frosted to set
up this problem let's give ourselves a
picture of what's going on here are two
rectangular cakes and I have 16 of it
frosted and strawberry icing for this
other cake I'm going to frost three
eighths of it in blueberry I seen notice
I've split up the cake into eight equal
parts and I have three of those eight
frosted or three eighths I'm not working
with two cakes tho i'm working with 1k
so let's visualize these two cakes on 1
i'm going to show that here so notice i
have 16 of the cake frosted and
strawberry icing and three eighths of it
frosted in blueberry icing and we're
trying to figure out what fraction is
not frosted the chocolate part to set up
this problem we know we're going to
start with one whole cake then i need to
subtract off 16 of the cake and three
eighths of the cake so i'll have 1 minus
16 minus three eighths I can't compare 6
2 eights right now there are different
sized pieces so I can't just subtract
these numbers I need to get a common
denominator just like we did when adding
fractions so let's try this with a quiz
and see if we can remember how to find a
common denominator what do you think the
common denominator would be for these
fractions remember you can list the
multiples or use the factor tree you
don't have to worry about the one when
finding the common denominator this is
because we can change the one into two
halves three thirds 12 12 or even 100
707 all of these numbers are still equal
to one so what's the common denominator
for these fractions you can put your
answer in this box here remember to find
the common denominator you can list the
multiples or use the factor tree</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
