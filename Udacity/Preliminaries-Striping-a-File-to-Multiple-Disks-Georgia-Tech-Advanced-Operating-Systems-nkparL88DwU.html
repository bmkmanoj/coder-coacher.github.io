discussed in this distributed file
system lesson I have to introduce you to
a lot of background technologies the
first background technology that I'm
going to introduce you to is what is
called RAID storage raid stands for
redundant array of inexpensive disks the
idea is a given disk may have a certain
IO bandwidth available now if I can
string together a number of disks in
parallel then cumulatively
I can get much more IO bandwidth coming
out of all of these disks that's the
idea of the raid technology which is
redundant array of inexpensive disks
since we have an array of disks we're
also increasing the probability of
failures and that is why in the raid
technology they also use an
error-correcting technology associated
with raid and the basic idea is that
when you write a file you're going to do
the following you take a file let's say
this file has 4 parts to it what I'm
going to do is when I write this file
I'm going to write part 1 to this disk
part 2 to this disk 3 to this and for
this because my data is on multiple disk
I am also increasing the chance that
they may be failures that can hurt me
and therefore what we do is we compute a
checksum for this particular data that
I've stored on these disks and store
that in a fifth disk and this is what is
called error correcting code so an error
correcting code allows errors to be
detected when I read things from the
disk and I see or something is wrong I
can correct it using this extra
information that I'm writing on the
fifth desk here so that's the big
picture of how striping of file to
multiple disks works basically what we
do is we take a file and decide that if
it is going to be striped over four
disks
we stripe it on the four discs and we
also write an error correcting code for
the data that we have striped across
these discs so that if in fact there is
an error that manifests itself in the
future with any one of these discs that
error can be corrected using this error
correcting data that we have written to
augment the original data so failure
protection is being achieved through
this error correction code that's the
idea of striping a file in the raid
system the drawback in the raid
technology is first of all the cost the
fact that we have to have multiple
Hardware drives in order to store a
single file and the second problem is
what is called a small write problem and
that is if my file is really really
small then I'm saying that a part of
this file is going to be written on each
one of these disks and that's
inefficient in terms of how you store
data and the reason why it is
inefficient of course is the fact that
if it is a small file and I have striped
it across multiple disks in order to
read that small file I have to get data
from all of these disks and that's
inefficient and that's the thing that is
detrimental about the hardware aid in
terms of handling a normal file system
that may have a population of small
files and large files and so on and so
forth but the idea of having an array of
disks to serve the file system is a good
one because it increases the overall IO
bandwidth that's available in the server
so how can we solve the small write
problem</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
