we need to operate a network so we need
a way to encode and interpret messages
so we saw that we can encode any message
we want in bits and then we can encode
the bits on the wire how that encoding
actually works is pretty complicated or
not something we're going to talk about
in this class but there are lots of
different ways to do it but we're
figuring out ways for each 0 and 1 to
encode that as something that we send
along a wire or it could be Wireless
what we haven't talked about which we
are going to talk about soon is what
these high-level messages are we need
ways to send messages that can be
interpreted and understood at the other
side and so what we'll talk about next
is how that works on the Internet as far
as a way to route messages for the
internet all of the routers along that
path well a message comes in it has a
destination the routers have to figure
out the next destination to go to and
that's also quite a challenging problem
it's something we're not going to get
into more detail in this class but you
can imagine different ways you might do
this a router might have a table that
says well if you're in California and
you want to send a message to Boston you
should first send it to Nevada because
that's going in the right direction
that's not quite the way things work
because we saw that there was actually
just one message that really what you
want to do was send it to San Jose we've
got a big strong pipe that goes all the
way to Boston finally you need ways to
decide who gets resources and on our
Greek network we assume that the general
could decide dinner it is much more of a
Wild West than that in the internet
there aren't any real rules for who gets
resources everywhere along the network
gets to decide on its own how to do that
and what we really get on the internet
is just what we call best effort service
if your message needs to go over the
same link as some other message the
router can only send one message at a
time it's up to the router decide what
to do there are different policies that
different routers fall there's no
general rule that is enforced on the
whole internet and this means that
sometimes your packet might just get
dropped there's no guarantee when you
send a message on the internet that it
actually gets to where you want it to so
we're not gonna talk more about these
two in this class I will encourage you
to take a future networking class that
will get into those details we are going
to talk a little bit about how the
messages work for the web</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
