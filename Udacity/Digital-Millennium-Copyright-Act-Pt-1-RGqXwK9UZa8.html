talk about is the Digital Millennium
Copyright Act or popularly known as the
DMCA and this has to do with we
discussed intellectual property so
content digital content software and the
problem it helps to address is piracy
illegal copying for example or theft of
these kind of digital objects that's
what our DMCA covers so first of all it
says that digital objects the kind I was
talking about actually can be
copyrighted so you have protections that
you get when you able to obtain a
copyright on something well the same
thing now applies to that was the non
digital world the same thing now applies
to digital objects
well the MCs has it is a crime for you
to circumvent and disable any measures
that are there that have to do with anti
with copy protection and anti anti
piracy so if these are built into the
object you sort of can't reverse
engineer and undo that and and that act
is is considered illegal if you do that
it also not only can do that it makes it
criminal for you to actually whatever
idea that you had to produce something
based on that manufacture it and then
sell and distribute it so somebody else
can defeat the the copy protection or
the anti-piracy measures that are in
place so essentially what we're saying
is that you know we need to protect
those and illegal to undo those
protections and sort of indulge in
commerce that allows you to you know let
all of other people do the same</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
