applications so at the end of your last
homework you should have Google App
Engine running on your machine and you
should have a basic site online we're
gonna start with basically the simple
hello world example that Google has on
their site which I have this is the main
hello world Python file from the from
the Google App Engine example page and
it's got two main sections we'll start
with this section down here at the
bottom this is the URL mapping section
and in this case we have one URL slash
and it maps to a handler called main
page main page is defined in this class
called main page it inherits from web
app to request handler which is kind of
the which is the generic you know
request handler from from Google if you
don't know what classes are you can
learn about them offline it's basically
a convenient way for you know grouping
together functions and data that all
related to the same thing we're not
gonna spend a whole lot of time on it
here but you should be able to keep up
just fine our class is a function called
get which takes a parameter called self
which is the common way the common first
parameter to most Python methods so if
this function does two things first it
takes self dot response which is the
kind of global response object that will
be handling or that this framework uses
and it sets a header
it sets the content type header to equal
text plane by default the content type
is text HTML but in this case is setting
at the text plane and then it's writing
the string hello web app world so if we
start off Google App Engine I'll start
Google App Engine in my terminal here
and then I'll go to my browser and load
the page and this is what we see we see
that string that our that our program
was writing out in our browser hello web
app world pretty neat</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
