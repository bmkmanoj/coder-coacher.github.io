strategy for my solution and then i'm
going to show you the code now i said
before that a bad strategy would be to
start at the front and then when we find
a palindrome try to extend it by
extending on to the end why is that bad
because just knowing that the first
characters of a substring is a
palindrome doesn't tell you anything
about expanding it by adding characters
onto one end but there's another way to
look at it where it does work if we
start in the middle then we can expand
and and then every time we move out we
are gaining some information so let's
say if instead of starting here we
started here and we say is C by itself a
palindrome well yes it is because every
one character string is a palindrome and
then instead of going only forward we go
one character in both directions and now
we're looking at b CB and say is that a
palindrome yes it is now we can go out
again in both directions ABC ba is that
a palindrome yes and we keep on growing
we keep on growing in the solution out
from the middle in both directions and
we keep on going as long as we can and
find the longest palindrome that's
centered on one of these positions and
as soon as we find something that's not
a palindrome let's say if instead of a
here there was an X then we can stop and
no matter how long the string is no
matter how many characters are here and
here we know that nothing centered on
the sea it's going to be a palindrome
that's any longer than that and so we
can eliminate a lot of the work and
that's the advantage of doing this now
what about the starting positions well
we got to start with every character
being the center and then we also have
to start with between every character
being the center so you know maybe the
longest palindrome in the string is just
a two character sequence if we only
looked at the first one and then went
out to the side we wouldn't find it if
we start by looking in between them in
other words start not with be but with
the empty string then when we move out
in both directions from the empty string
then we check
be so that's my approach for the
strategy if you didn't get the question
right why don't you try it again try to
implement this strategy before you look
at my solution now I'll show you what I
did so the key to this function is the
Grove function how do you grow a
potential palindrome from the middle out
and so grow is going to take a text a
start and an end position which are
either the ends going to be either 0 or
1 more than the start then we keep on
going until we hit the end so while the
start is greater than the than 0 the
start of the string and while the end is
less than the the end of the string and
while they match while the character one
to the left is equal to the character
one to the right but we allow for one of
them to be in different case if that's
true then we grow by expanding the start
to the left and expanding the end to the
right we keep on doing that as long as
we can and then we return the start in
the end so that's the Grove function
that will find you the longest sequence
that is centered on a particular text
with a particular start and end and then
longest sub palindrome slice just goes
through all the possibilities so it
tries to grow for every possible start
and end location and then we just take
the maximum length of out of all those
candidates where the length of a slice
is just the difference between the two
now we do that we have our tests we hit
run and it says test pass</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
