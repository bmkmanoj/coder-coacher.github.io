with is special
we call it the global environment by
default everyone gets a chance to see it
whenever we make a function call we make
a new environment that officially has
parent this environment knows that it
was created in defined in this global
environment so when we're interpreting
JavaScript we're going to use this
nested or chained notion of environments
to keep track of the values of variables
an environment is just a mapping from
variable names to values except
environments may also have parent
pointers every environment that's not
the global one has a parent beyond
having a parent pointer environments
just map variables to values B is 5 5 5
X is 2 to give you another way to think
about this notion of chained
environments we're gonna reason by an
analogy let's say that you're going on
vacation so you leave your home and you
go to stay at a hotel by the seashore
you don't bring everything in your home
with you but you bring a few things and
then eventually you're going to leave
your hotel room and go out on the beach
maybe you'll bring your swimming suit
pack a lunch that sort of thing you'll
bring a few items with you but not
everything that was in your hotel room
and certainly not everything that was in
your home now let's say that you've
forgotten your keys oh my gosh where are
they first place to check might be in
your pocket or around with you on the
beach did I bring them all the way to
the beach if not maybe they're back at
the hotel if they're not back in the
hotel maybe you left them at home and if
they're not at home
there isn't a lottery course maybe you
can call a locksmith or do something
else sort of generically hopefully you
can get new keys but ultimately there's
just nowhere else to check so this is
analogous of having a global environment
too big market place where you could buy
new keys and then some nested
environments on top of it your home your
hotel whatever you brought with you to
the beach so let's test our knowledge of
this idyllic tropics een with a quiz
suppose you are currently in the hotel
environment and we have a is six and B
is seven that points back to the home
environment where a is 44 and X is 55
and that points all the way to the
global environment where a is 1 B is 2
and C is 3 you're in the hotel and you
want to evaluate
BC and X what are the values of these
variables fill in the blanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
