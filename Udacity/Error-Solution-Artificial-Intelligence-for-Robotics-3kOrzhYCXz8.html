command as print evil my robot piano it
wasn't very hard but it gets you a kind
of fun to play with it so here's a
sequence of numbers I get out it turns
out we don't always get the same number
sometimes it doesn't work here's the
second run these are small values again
another one another one he's been this
interesting so we can look at these
errors 5 5 7 1 3 5 6 7 7 6
it is a good one so the arrow is down to
6 compared to whatever it would be if he
didn't do particle feel doesn't had a
random set of particles in fact to
understand this let me just take the
print evil command and move it to the
very beginning we've done no particle
Phaedrus so he'd run and will you find
this goes from 38 to 4 3 3 in just one
step of particle filtering which is a
drastic reduction of arrow now one did
many times there will be cases very
fails where this was no particle nearby
strangely this right now when I was
testing it in programming it I actually
got one of those he had an arrow of like
15 or 20 whenever I wanted them with
something it just doesn't work well this
particle filter is just too good it just
gets the answer relatively right really
really quickly</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
