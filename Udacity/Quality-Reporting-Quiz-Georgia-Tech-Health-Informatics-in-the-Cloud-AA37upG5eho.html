interesting and challenging area
generally done by reporting process
and/or outcome measures while outcome
measures are usually preferable we often
don't have practical ones available
hemoglobin a1c is a test done on a blood
sample that can serve both as a process
and an outcome measure for diabetes care
hemoglobin the red stuff in your blood
cells is the oxygen carrying molecule
the level of its a1c variant tracts with
the amount of glucose out in the blood
glucose is the molecule that is not
properly regulated in diabetes so the
more that's out in the blood the more of
it that enters the red blood cells the
more glucose in the cells the higher the
a1c level as we can see here not much
glucose a low a1c level lots of glucose
an unhappy red blood cell because it's
a1c is very high but this increase
occurs over time so hemoglobin a1c is
proportional to the average blood
glucose level over the prior couple of
months this is great since the goal of
diabetes therapy is to keep the same
average glucose level within normal
ranges over time as you can see here the
blood glucose level goes up and down
depending upon what's eaten exercise and
other factors however while it may go up
and down here the hemoglobin a1c level
remains constant at seven indicating
good control in fact good control is
defined as an a1c under nine by most
organizations but the highly regarded
Mayo Clinic uses this number seven as
its benchmark which of these would be an
outcome measure for diabetes recording
of key data testing for hemoglobin a1c
level on a regular basis heyhe will open
a1c level under nine</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
