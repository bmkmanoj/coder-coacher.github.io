be thinking okay come on we're in the
last unit why are we even discussing
this the thing is this when we talk
about problems that no computer can
solve I do not want to be talking about
these problems here beauty of a painting
or predicting soccer matches or
forecasting the lottery I want to talk
about problems that meet these three
requirements here and where we can still
prove that no computer will be able to
solve them although these requirements
here might sound very simple at first
it's easy to miss some of the details
here which is of course why we are now
going to have our first quiz I'm going
to give you a number of problems and I
want you to tell me if this is a
computer problem according to these
three rules here or if we would not
consider this as a computer problem and
you have to be very careful here so some
of them are a little bit tricky but then
again you're already in the final unit
so you've learned how to deal with
tricky questions by now hi hope so here
are eight problems for which I would
like you to determine if they are
computer problems according to these
rules here and again some of them are a
bit tricky so you have to be really
really careful in checking it the first
three problems given an essay written by
a student first problem does that sa
have at least ten thousand characters
second question which grade does this
essay deserve and third question does
the essay contain any misspelled words a
second set of potential computer
problems would be the following here
given two integers larger than zero what
is the sum of these two numbers second
potential problem does the smaller
integer divide the larger one so is it a
factor of the larger one so to say third
question given those two integers please
output a random integer between these
two so between the smaller one and the
larger one and finally I have two more
problems for you to check one problem is
given a string of zeros and ones check
if that string is randomly generated and
finally calculate the square root of
five so please for each of these
problems if you think that this is a
computer problem according to these
three rules here then make a check mark
otherwise leave the box blank again some
of them are a little tricky so you need
to check carefully and if you get stuck
then of course you can also skip to the
answer give this some thought first</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
