demonstration of the sampling
distribution of the mean otherwise known
as the distribution of sample means
we've laid out 48 plates each with a bag
of an mms on it we're going to dump out
these mms there's dr. Rogers doing so
across all 48 plates this is a very
tedious process so we've sped things up
a little bit to make it go faster once
we have all of the mm's dumped out we're
going to separate them by color we are
interested in the blue M&amp;amp;MS of course
you could pick any color if you wanted
you could use orange or green or yellow
but we've chosen blue once we've
separated out the blue M &amp;amp; M's we're
going to count them there I am helping
along dr. Rogers got tired me sitting
over the corner just watching so you
recruited my help once we have the blue
M&amp;amp;M sorted we're going to be interested
in the average number of blue eminem's
per bag or per plate in this case and
what we're going to do then is take
random samples of N equals 5 and compute
an average once we've done that we're
going to do that 50 times taking 50
random samples each with N equals 5
plates then we're going to construct a
histogram that histogram will be the
distribution of sample means remember
that the central limit theorem says that
the distribution of sample means will be
approximately normal and we'll have an
expected value of the mean equal to the
population mean now the true population
mean we've computed by taking all blue
M&amp;amp;MS across all plates and dividing by
48 the number of plates remember the
central limit theorem also says that the
standard deviation of the distribution
of sample means is equal to Sigma the
population standard deviation divided by
the square root of the sample size let's
see how the data turned out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
