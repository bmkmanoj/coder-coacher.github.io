like if you have the right knowledge
representation problem-solving becomes
very easy let's see whether that old saw
works here we now have $1 representation
for this problem of guards and prisoners
the SIS knowledge representation
immediately afford effective problem
solving so here we are in the first node
the first state there are three guards
and three prisoners in the boat all on
the left-hand side let us see what moves
are possible from this initial state now
using this representation we can quickly
figure out that there are five possible
moves from the initial state and the
first move we move only one guard to the
right on the second move we move a guard
and a prisoner to the right and it's
hard move we can move two guards or two
prisoners or in the fifth move just one
prisoner to the right five possible
moves of course we know that some of
these moves are illegal and some of them
are likely to be not very productive
will this semantic network allow us to
make inferences about which moves are
productive and which moves are not
productive
let's see further so let's look at the
legal moves first so we can immediately
make out from this representation that
the first move is not legal because we
are not allowed to have more prisoners
than guards on one side of the river
similarly we know that the third move
was illegal for the same reason so we
can immediately rule out the force in
the third moves the fifth move too can
be ruled out let's see how we have one
prisoner on the other side but the only
way to go back would be to take the
prisoner to the back to the previous
side and if we do that we reach the
initial state so we did not make any
forward progress therefore we can rule
out this move as well this leaves us
with two possible moves that are both
legal and productive the we have already
removed the moves that were not legal
not productive later we will see how a I
programs can use various methods to
figure out what moves are productive and
what moves are unproductive for the time
being
let's go along with our problem-solving</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
