is really minimal compared to what you
already implemented and with this
modification you've implemented a star
which is around the most powerful search
I wouldn't that be used to the present
day to drive self-driving cars through
unstructured environments the very first
thing we do is we expand elements in the
open list to not just contain GS before
but also F and I also included H over
here that isn't necessary but I did it
anyhow
so now we have five to blitz where G is
the values before H is the heuristic
value of the cell XY and F is the sum of
the two the reason why would F left is I
need this for my sort trick so I can
sort according to F when I sort the list
so notice this has become two elements
longer and by moving F to the left side
I've implemented that the element I
remove will be the vamper the lowest F
value not the lowest G value as I go
further down and expand the note has
happened in this lines over here I now
need to modify the index into the next
structure a little bit X is now element
number three which is technically the
fourth element in the list but we start
indexing with zero why is element number
four G's element number one F and H I
don't need to pop here because I compute
them from scratch in just a minute
so as I go further down where I expand a
node from the list and compute of all
possible actions what the successor
state is and test whether these are
legal states to expand I now as before
increment G by the cost function but
here are two new lines of code first I
compute the heuristic function for the
new expanded note that's very
straightforward I'll call it h 2 and
then in the next line of code I compute
the new sum of the G value and the H
value and I use those five things the
new F value the new G value the new H
value and the X&amp;amp;Y of the expanded nodes
to append to the open list so new here
is most importantly the F value but also
the H value
and that's all there is to implementing
a star so all I've done is I've just
changed the logic according to which I
remove notes from the stack to pick the
one the head zoom F value as opposed to
the minimum G value and I have a star so
let me run it this is for the maize feed
up Ted before let me move the open spot
to the top over here and put a wall back
here it turned in this case a star is
not so efficient in the area over here
it has no preference to go either way if
it finally finds the the goal node that
however changes when I put a big
obstacle horizontally over here at which
point is really interesting to see a
star can I decide whether the horizontal
path is best or the vertical path so it
alternative pops nodes from either one
of those but the moments over here the
same trick applies as before
it doesn't expend anything in the center
anymore and goes straight to the goal
and reaches the goal over here that
would not happen without a star in fact
the way to revert back to the old search
is to just give it an empty heuristic
function so here is a definition of the
aristocrat and initialized age all with
zeros everywhere instead of the
heuristic function over here which I
won't use for a second was called
heuristic old and this is the current
heuristic function if I run it with a
realistic function of all zeros I get
back my original search algorithm and
you can see this search algorithm
explores into the interior a little bit
the result expands more nodes than a
star this might look very insignificant
but if you get to very large
environments it can make a huge
difference especially if there's a huge
dead end somewhere that can't reach the
goal then a star performs much much more
efficiently than the simple search</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
