somewhere else that if I've got some
point that's at a vector R from the
origin let's say I'm the origin or the
origins of the middle of the object
doesn't matter if that point is rotating
about the origin with some angular
rotation Omega and it's also translating
with some translational velocity T ok
the overall velocity of that point I
hope you remember this from physics was
V is equal to Omega cross R plus T it's
just true you can work it out and here's
what that looks like written out
remember we did that crossing operator
could be written as a matrix
multiplication we did that for essential
and fundamental matrices so that's all
this is we've just written out the cross
operator as a matrix where these are the
components of the rotational velocity
and these are the components of the
translational velocity in fact that's
what it says here so VX v sub X V sub y
v sub Z are the velocity vectors in the
world in the world in the XYZ direction
vtx vty vtz are the translational
components in the world and omega x
omega by omega z are the angular
velocity components in the world all
right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
