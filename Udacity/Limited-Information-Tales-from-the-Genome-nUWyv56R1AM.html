generations let's say four dominant and
recessive trait in a pedigree we could
really be missing information take this
example here I have two very small
pedigrees of just an immediate family
and they showed the same affected
inheritance pattern where one child one
daughter is affected but one of these
pedigrees is for a recessive trait that
both parents have an allele for but
they're unaffected and then they pass
both of those recessive alleles onto the
daughter and the other pedigree is from
a very new spontaneous mutation that's
causing a dominant trait but the
question is can you tell the difference
I can't the only way to distinguish
these two possibilities would be to zoom
out on both pedigrees and fill in as
much family information as we can this
family history is going to be able to
help us figure out which one of these is
a recessive trait pedigree in which of
these is a spontaneous mutation that's
caused a new dominant trait for example
this pedigree on the right is most
likely the pedigree of a recessive trait
because we now see that there's a family
history unaffected parents with affected
offspring the trait skips generations
and we see it on both sides of the
family where's the other pedigrees most
likely caused from our spontaneous
mutation and the new dominant trait
because we don't have any family history
of it whatsoever although again this
could still possibly be a result of
limited information and maybe we just
need to zoom out even further to tell if
it's actually another possibility of it
being a recessive pedigree as well the
point is is that any time we're really
doing this in real life we try to get as
much information as possible and
specifically when we're trying to
distinguish these two scenarios what
we're looking for is a family history of
the condition meaning that you've got
maybe more than one affected sibling or
parent or close relative or even
possibilities of consanguineous
relationships effectively reproduction
with close relatives</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
