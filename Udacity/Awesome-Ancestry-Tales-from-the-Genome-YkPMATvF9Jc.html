of ancestry composition I mean I feel
like it's pretty homogeneous I'd love
you you to pull up the the results for
friend of mine Roy King whole week who
now Roy understands that his ancestry
traces to Europe to Africa and that he
has some Native American ancestry and
when we look at his results here we see
look even chromosome one has multiple
colors it has the Red the light blue and
a darker blue and the darker blue there
refers to an Aussie Jewish ancestry and
Roy knows that his father's father was
was Jewish mhm and so if we go back to
map view will see that about getting
close to a quarter of Roy's ancestry
traces back to the Ashkenazi Jewish
population and and that fits with his
one of his grandfather's being Ashkenazi
Jewish and if we look at the rest of his
ancestry almost half traces back to
sub-saharan Africa the red ring here and
the rest traces back to Northern Europe
specifically Britain and Ireland now
what is really cool is that we have
these bars right here if we look over if
you click on the Native American so
those orange and deep red bars refer to
parts of the genome that traced back to
a native americans and and intriguingly
Roy King knows on his mother's side he
has ancestors a creek and Choctaw
ancestors so that is showing up in his
DNA so basically you know his
understanding of where his ancestors
come from really shows up very
beautifully in his DNA right he has a
much more interesting genetic background
than I've from many different parts and
that is important even when we go to
look at the health results the Health
reports are all done in the context of a
particular population so
is very important to kind of be clear on
the ancestral background of someone as
we go to look at the other parts of the
results great</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
