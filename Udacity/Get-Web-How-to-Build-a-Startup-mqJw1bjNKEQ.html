web/mobile funnel now what's really
interesting is in the web/mobile funnel
the getting customers part of the funnel
it's actually quite simple at least on
first glance we still have earned and
paid media driving customers into the
funnel if you remember we understood who
the customer archetype was we're running
search engine marketing or search engine
optimization but in the web we just
really have to do two things first one
is we got to acquire customers and then
we activate them
well what's acquire me acquire on the
web is I want to get them to my site or
to my mobile app or to my cloud app how
do I do that as we sit learned and paid
media will drive customers somehow to be
looking at a place that you're at but
the next step is much harder after i
acquire them I want them to do something
I just don't want them to look and go
away I want them to either pay for the
product or sign up for something or
become a user that is the word activate
means I want you to engage with my
website or my app and do something I
have planned for you to do now in the
simple world is what I would plan for
you to do is open your wallet and give
me all your money in a non perfect world
you might just be a user and I'm going
to monetize you by getting payers to pay
for the fact that I have lots of users
but acquisition that is acquire and
activation is a two-part strategy so in
theory understanding acquisition and
activation seems pretty simple I get it
I understand who my customers are and
then I figure out what earned and paid
media I want to use and on the web that
might be paying Google for Adwords and I
want to acquire them and I want to
activate them how hard could this be
well it actually gets kind of fun
because the real metric the way we kind
of measure things the language we use on
the web is customer acquisition cost and
what we want to do is figure out how
much is it really going to cost us to
get an activated customer out here on
the right hand of the get funnel so
let's kind of do an exercise and see
what it feels like and how does it work
to get an activated customer and how
much it cost</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
