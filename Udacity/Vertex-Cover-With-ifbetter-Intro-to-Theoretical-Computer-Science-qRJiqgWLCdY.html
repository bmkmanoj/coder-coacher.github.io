if-better function available then we can
solve vertex cover in polynomial time
because as we said the if-better
function works in polynomial time and
we're calling it once for each vertex in
the graph so we're calling it end times
it works in polynomial time so this part
here of finding the best possible
assignment of zeros and ones to the
vertices that works in polynomial time
and as you know from before checking if
an assignment is valid and checking the
size of an assignment that's also doable
in polynomial time so the total running
time of the algorithm is polynomial in n
the number of vertices and the way thing
is that although you shouldn't probably
anthropomorphize list the if-better
function always knows what will help us
so if we were trying to solve click or
independent set instead of vertex cover
the if-better function would somehow
know this and give us a different
assignment of zeros and ones to the
vertices which would however still be
guaranteed to be optimal and that is
what makes this function so extremely
powerful</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
