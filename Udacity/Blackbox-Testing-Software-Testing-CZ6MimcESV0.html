looking through all of the incorrect
implementations of the queue and then
we'll see how we actually caught all of
the bugs so the first queue has an error
where you end Q and it only stores
integers up to 2 to the 16th and that's
roughly 32,000 so when you and Q things
it just silently wraps it back around to
0 if you go over that the second queue
silently fails to create queues with
more than 15 elements so in the
initializer if if the max size is
greater than 15 then it just sets it to
15 and doesn't tell you about it at all
the third queue is a little tricky it
implements the empty method by trying to
DQ an element and checking if the DQ is
none it is then it returns true if it
isn't then it returns false and because
the empty method changes the state of
the queue when it shouldn't this is
going to cause buggy behavior the fourth
queue has a bug in the DQ method when
you try to DQ from an empty queue he
returns false where it should according
to the specification returned none the
final queue just holds one less element
then you tell it hold so it just
decrement size max when you pass it in
by one and then stores that many
elements instead of how many you told it
to so now let's try to catch all these
bugs the first queue can be caught by
just trying to NQ a value greater than
two to the 16th and then D queueing it
and check the value is correct the
second queue you try to and queue more
than 15 elements because remember that
was the one that only stored 15 without
telling you so as soon as you go past 15
this assertion should fail third queue
is a little bit trickier we create a
queue with two elements then we try to
include 10 which should succeed fine
we check that then we assert that the
queue is not empty which it shouldn't be
but remember that this empty function
checks that it's empty by trying to DQ
which removes ten from the queue now
when we try to DQ a second time
now the queue is empty so it's not going
to return ten it's going to return none
so this assertion is going to fail the
fourth queue returns false instead of
none when you try to DQ from an empty
queue so to test this we instantiate a
2-element queue and we try to
immediately DQ from that empty queue and
we should get none which is what we're
checking but instead we get false so
this assertion will fail now the final
queue just holds one less item than
intended so we created 2-element queue
and we try to and q2 elements and this
will fail for the second since this
queue will only hold one element not two
so this second attempt will fail okay I
hope you enjoyed catching all those bugs
this is something that comes up fairly
frequently when you have to do blackbox
testing when you don't actually know the
code that you're running against you
don't have access to it so we'll talk a
bit more about that in unit 2 and I hope
to see you there Thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
