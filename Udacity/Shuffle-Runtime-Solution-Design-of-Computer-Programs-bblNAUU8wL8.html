squared on average will be more time
proportional to N squared and the way
you can see that is to think about how
long it's going to take to get the very
last item of this swapped array filled
in so say all the items are true all the
way through except there's one holdout
that we haven't got yet this one still
false about how long will it take until
we randomly choose a number so that we
can make this one be true and the answer
is there's n of these and each time
we're going through and we're generating
indices so it's going to take about n
random numbers before we get that so for
each of these n elements of the array we
can expect on average to take n or less
for the first one it'll be easy second
one will be a little bit harder the last
few it'll be hard as still but in the
average case the complexity is going to
be on the order of n times generating a
random number for each of the N elements
of the array or at order N squared all
together</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
