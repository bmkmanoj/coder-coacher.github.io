values in the URL the value we submitted
and the value we hard-coded in our code
so let's take a quick look at this again
we call that in our code I added this
extra input type hidden' name equals
food which matches this name and the
value eggs hard coded and then in our
browser when I clicks take the URL
updates to have both steak the one we
just added and eggs in the URL and let's
try a few more examples while we're here
let me try adding pizza we can see steak
the one that came from us change the
pizza and eggs remained and let's see
also what happens if i type in eggs now
we get eggs twice so you can see we
always have the value that was in our
hidden elements in the URL and then what
came from the user is also there but we
can't add multiple things quite yet to
be honest with you I was on he's
actually sure what was going to happen
when I was writing this lesson plan just
happened to work out in a way that I
could make a nice example it just goes
to show you you know some of the stuff
is a little tricky but it's very easy to
just play around in your editor and in
your browser to actually you know see
what happens</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
