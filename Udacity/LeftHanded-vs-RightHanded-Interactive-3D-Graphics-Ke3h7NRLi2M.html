both have five fingers but look
different coordinate systems also have
an orientation to them we need to find a
set of axes you also need to specify one
other fact whether the axes are in
right-handed or left-handed system
here's an example of a right-handed
coordinate system say I want to build a
building I define the x axis as going
east and the y axis is going north now
my floor plan shows X pointing right Y
pointing up this is the standard 2d
Cartesian coordinate system if I define
altitude as the z axis with the arrow
coming out of the diagram towards the
viewer this is a right-handed coordinate
system why is this right-handed well if
you place your thumb along the x axis
and the index finger along the y axis
the middle finger is the z axis and
points towards you you'll notice if you
try to do the same thing with your left
hand you can't match up all three axes
at least not comfortably this is a
left-handed coordinate system the key
thing to realize is that the left-handed
coordinate system is equally valid it
does not change the underlying reality
of the situation for example intelligent
rabbits might agree that X is east and Y
is north that's fine however they might
decide that the z axis points down into
the page the rabbits care more about how
far down a tunnel is dug from ground
level and want to say five feet instead
of negative five feet when they're
digging this is a left handed coordinate
system the underlying reality is the
same in both cases nothing has changed
place just how we and the rabbits refer
to location differs when we say 12
meters the rabbits would say negative 12
meters and vice versa to convert between
these particular two systems is simply a
matter of negating the Z coordinate
value</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
