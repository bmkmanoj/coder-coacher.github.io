assessments of this course all mentioned
the idea of contributing to the field of
educational technology so it's really
important that we ask what is
educational technology is educational
technology only the use of technology in
the context of learning as far as we're
concerned no for us educational
technology is any place for education
and technology intersect even if it
occurs far away from the actual learning
process so for example we could use
technology to help the admissions
process to identify what students are
more likely to succeed we could use
technology to facilitate registration
and in fact we already do but we can use
it to make it better we could use
technology to help load balance or
anticipate what classes are going to
draw more students so we can allocate
our resources more intelligently we've
used technology to facilitate
collaboration at a distance to help
students work on group projects together
even when they're not located in same
place and there's also a big field
that's not the education using
technology but it's the education of
Technology teaching students to use
technology or to program or things like
that so there are a lot of places where
education and technology intersect that
aren't right there in the context of
learning and as far as we're concerned
they all fall under the umbrella of
educational technology</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
