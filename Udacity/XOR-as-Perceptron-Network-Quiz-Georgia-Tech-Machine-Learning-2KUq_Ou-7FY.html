do we're going to try to figure out how
to draw
sorry compute X or AZ instead of a
single perceptron which we know is
impossible we can do it as a network of
perceptron and just to make it easier
for you here's how we're going to set it
up that we're we've got X 1 and X 2 as
our inputs we've got two units this
first unit is just going to compute an
ad and we already know how to do that
we've already figured out what weights
need to be here and here and what the
threshold needs to be so that the output
will be the end of those two inputs so
that's all good but what we don't know
what it turns out to be the case that
the second unit with now three inputs x1
x2 and the end of x1 and x2 can also be
made to or can be can be now we can set
the weights on that so that the output
is going to be X or so what we'd like
you to do is figure out how to do that
how do you set this weight that is the
input of x1 this weight which is the and
input and this weight which is the x2
input and the threshold so that it's
going to actually compute an X right and
and just so you know this is not a trick
question you really can do it this time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
