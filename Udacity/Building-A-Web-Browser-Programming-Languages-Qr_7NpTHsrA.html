Weimer and together we're going to learn
the theory and practice of programming
languages culminating in the
construction of a web browser our web
browser will accept as input HTML and
JavaScript the primary languages of the
web and use that to produce an image of
the web page you may already be familiar
with HTML which describes the basics of
web pages and will certainly go over it
in this course later on but you may be a
little less familiar with JavaScript
which allows one to describe
computations that take place on webpages
this gives us a lot of power and also a
lot of flashy graphics let's see some
examples this particular web page chosen
more or less at random uses JavaScript
to animate these tabs for its title bar
at the top this is a second example of a
web page that uses JavaScript both here
at the top for this sort of floating
tooltip but also down here at the bottom
to animate the differences between these
textual boxes if we look at the source
for one of these webpages we can see
that it contains both HTML and
JavaScript right from the start so let
me give you a brief overview in pictures
more or less of how this course and the
overarching project will go we start
with the source to a web page which is
in HTML and JavaScript our next main
step is to break that source into
important words just like we could break
an English sentence in two important
words then we'll understand the
structure of the words that we found for
example focusing on this part down here
it may be easier to understand one plus
two plus three as a tree showing all of
the computations and then finally we'll
figure out the meaning of that structure
for example in this case maybe all of
that adds up to 6 and that's what we'll
display in our resulting webpage
building a web browser will be a lot of
fun but the overall goal of this course
is not actually to build a production
quality browser but instead to use the
goal of building a browser as a way of
structuring our exploration of computer
science so let's get started right here
