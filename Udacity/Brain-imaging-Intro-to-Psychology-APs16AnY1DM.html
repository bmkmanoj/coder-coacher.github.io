information and it is but that's why you
have this PDF come back to it whenever
you need to it should really help now
the last section of this lesson that
we're going to go over is how you can
measure brain activity I'm going to pass
it to Susan to explain it to you many of
the advances and understanding the link
between behavior and brain have occurred
in the last 20 years because of better
techniques for measuring brain activity
for example how do we know that spatial
ability is related to the parietal area
or that the frontal lobe is responsible
for impulse control how do we know the
hippocampus is associated with learning
and memory historically we learned about
the brain function through accidents
such as we saw with Phineas Gage since
the 1940s we have been able to measure
brain activity but it's really been
since the 1990s that we've seen better
techniques that allow us to look at
precise areas of the brain that are
being activated this has been such a
revolution that some people call it the
neuroscience revolution</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
