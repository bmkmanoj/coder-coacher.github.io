cognitive system notice that I'm using
the term cognitive system and not the
term knowledge-based AI agent I could
have used that term also when we talk
about knowledge-based AI agent then we
can take two views one view is that we
are going to build a knowledge-based AI
system which need not be human-like
another view is that the knowledge-based
AI agent that we will build will be
human-like the cognitive system is
situated in the world here by the world
I mean the physical world for example
the world that I am interacting with
right now with this screen in front of
me in this microphone this world has
perception it there's an example the
percept of something being a straight
line or a color of some object or the
smoothness of some texture of some
object this perception in the world and
the cognitive system is using sensors to
perceive these percept that's the input
the cognitive system the cognitive
system also has some actuators so for
example I have fingers that I'm using
right now to point to things and a
cognitive system uses actuators to carry
on actions in the world the cognitive
system then is taking perception input
and giving actions as output so far we
have talked about a single cognitive
system but of course one can have
multiple cognitive systems these
multiple cognitive systems can interact
with each other just like a cognitive
system is situated in a physical world
it is also situated in a social world
that is now zoom into the inside of a
cognitive system what is the
architecture of a cognitive system so
the cognitive system takes as input
certain percepts about the world it has
a task of giving as output actions of
the world the question then becomes how
can these percept we've mapped into
actions one way of mapping them is that
we will do a direct mapping this percept
will be directly mapped into actions
let's take an example imagine that
you're driving a car and the brake
lights of the car in front of you become
bright red should that happen you will
then
on the brakes of your car but that is an
example of a reactive system the
percepts were the brake lights of the
car in front of you became bright red
and the action was that you pressed on
your own brakes in doing so you may not
have planned this is now a direct
mapping of percepts into actions
alternatively considered a slightly
different problem again you're driving
your car on the highway but as you're
trying to drive on the highway your task
this time is to change lanes now in
order to change lanes again you may look
around and look at the percepts of the
world there are other cars on the road
for example and you predict some action
that will help you change lanes this
time you may actually deliberate you may
actually look at the goal that you have
as well as the percepts of the
environment and come up with a plan that
will tell you what action to take as we
discussed in the last lesson the
deliberation itself has a number of
components in it three of the major
components that we'll be studying in
this class are learning reasoning and
memory these three components interact
with each other in many interesting ways
that we will decipher as we go along now
deliberation was reasoning about the
world around us so if I take that
example again of changing lanes as I'm
driving on the highway
then I'm reasoning about the world
around me where are the other cars
should I change lanes to the left or to
the right
metacognition on the other hand the
third layer here has to do with
reasoning about the internal mental
world so metacognition reasons about the
deliberation or metacognition can also
reason about reaction let us take an
example of the metacognition also
imagine again that I have to change
lanes and I did as I change lanes to the
left the cars behind me honk because I
did not leave enough space for the car
that was already moving on the left lane
in that case I know that the lane
changing did not go very smoothly I may
not think about my own actions in the
world about the deliberation that led to
those actions and may then decide to
change or reconfigure or
repaired the deliberation that led to
that sub-optimal plan for changing the
lanes there is an example of
metacognition so now I have this three
layered architecture reaction
deliberation metacognition note that we
have defined intelligence in a way
intelligence here is about mapping
perception the world into actions in the
world intelligence is about selecting
the right kind of action given a
particular state of the world but there
are many different ways in we can map
the percepts into actions purely
reactive deliberative or also entailing
metacognition
on the deliberation and reaction this
then is the overall architecture of the
cognitive system this is called three
layered architecture we'll be returning
to this architecture many times in this
course</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
