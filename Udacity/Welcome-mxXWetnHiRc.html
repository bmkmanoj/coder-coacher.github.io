have you ever felt like building a web
application is like making something
with tiny pieces and no instructions at
all
javascript is flexible so is the Dom
which makes browser application
development feel like assembling a
million tiny pieces you don't have to do
this alone though front-end frameworks
such as backbone angular and ember
handle the common details so you can
focus on what makes your app special so
welcome i'm richard killeth a course
developer at Udacity and a front-end
application developer I'm excited that
you've decided to come on this journey
with me
let's discover the amazing capabilities
that front-end frameworks provide us
developers in this course we'll be
taking a look at the major features of
client-side single page applications and
some s.p.a frameworks we'll work our way
up from backbone underscore then build
the applications with other popular
frameworks by the way people have asked
us why we're not covering react rect is
an incredibly popular library for
quickly updating the Dom but it only
really handles the view not the whole
application we're focusing on the
complete application framework once
you've completed this course you'll be
in a great place to learn react when you
finish this course what will you be able
to do you'll be able to slip right into
working with popular JavaScript
frameworks and you'll also be able to
evaluate frameworks to see if they meet
the needs of your new project</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
