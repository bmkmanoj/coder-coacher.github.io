this consideration of variance and
covariance between individual stocks and
the recognition that you want to blend
those together that have anti
correlation so you can have a much lower
risk portfolio if you combine assets
that are anti correlated or anti
variants if that is a word because when
one moves up the other moves down they
cancel each other out and you have much
less volatility now of course you want
over all these assets to in general move
up together so often what we're looking
for is anti correlation in the short
term and positive correlation and a
longer term but out of this work grew a
number of algorithms one of the key ones
being mean variance optimization which
is a way of taking a potential set of
assets and figuring out how they should
be blended together by looking at their
covariance among other things so let's
consider this group of assets here and
how we might combine them or allocate
funds to them to provide a good
portfolio one thing I didn't point out
before that I want to mention now is it
generally the higher return stocks or
assets whatever they might be
tend to also be the highest risk so as
we roll down the risk we tend to also
look at lower return now again how do we
combine these into a good portfolio
here's what goes into a mean variance
optimizer these are the factors that it
considers so for each stock you have to
provide an expected return in other
words what do we think in the future
it's going to provide in terms of return
you also provide volatility and
covariance volatility is simply
historically how volatile has each one
of these assets been covariance is a
matrix which shows between each assets
and every other asset what is the
correlation of daily returns so it takes
all
these into account when it is searching
for the right waiting for each of these
stocks in a portfolio so the last and
perhaps one of the most important inputs
to this is the target return we can
target a return anywhere from the max
return asset to the men return asset and
then anything else between those of
course we can accomplish by blending so
let's suppose this is the level of our
target return so I'll just put a dotted
line here so we can mark that for later
so the output of an optimizer is a set
of weights one weight for each asset
that provides the target return but
minimizes risk so in the end we're
looking for a portfolio that's out here
in other words it's got risk that's even
lower than any of the individual assets
but it meets the target return and this
is possible because we consider
covariance we're only looking at
individual risk we wouldn't be able to
find the right blend that would bring us
out here now that's it for optimization
and the insights from Markowitz but
there's one more thing to look at with
regard to optimizers that I'm going to
show you next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
