grammars for well balanced expressions
in arithmetic and well balanced web page
tags in HTML we're going to return our
attention to javascript javascript is
actually very similar to python and just
like I showed you a formal grammar for
HTML we're going to work our way up to
seeing a formal grammar for javascript
but before we get there just want to
make sure that we really understand how
JavaScript programs are interpreted so
I'm going to show you a few more in
Python and in JavaScript for comparison
over here on the Left I have a Python
function that computes the absolute
value of its integer argument if you
give me a negative number like negative
5 I will return positive 5 if you give
me a positive number like positive 9
million i will return 9 million so the
return value of this function is always
either a 0 or a positive number and i'm
going to write the same thing in
javascript to provide for a comparison
everything i've drawn in blue is a
special keyword or punctuation mark used
by the language so for example to define
a function in Python we use d e f in
javascript we write out the word
function but then it's still our choice
what to call it i'm calling it abs eval
in both cases and how many parameters it
should receive and what their names are
in both cases we have one parameter
named X in Python we use colons and
tabbing to tell what the body of a
function is what the then branch for an
if is what the else branch for an F is
in JavaScript we use curly braces and
closing curly braces to denote this sort
of lexical or syntactic scope so this is
sort of curly brace one and it matches
up with close curly brace one over here
two matches up with two three matches up
with three but in general the logical
structure the flow where the meaning is
the same in both cases we check to see
if X is less than zero and we return 0
minus X in that case or just X alone in
the other case one of the most important
operations in any language is printing
out information displaying it to the
screen so that we can see the result of
a computation or just to help us debug
in Python we
use the print procedure we pass it a
bunch of strings here I'm adding
together the strings hello and ! to make
a very enthusiastic greeting hello over
here on the right I'm showing the same
thing in JavaScript the equivalent of
print is document dot write or perhaps
just write in this class will almost
always abbreviate it down to just write
to a safe space if you're familiar with
object-oriented programming which is not
required for this class you might guess
what the dot is about you might talk
more about that later one of the key
differences though is that all of our
JavaScript functions have to have these
open and closed parenthesis like a
mathematical function has parenthesis
around its argument</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
