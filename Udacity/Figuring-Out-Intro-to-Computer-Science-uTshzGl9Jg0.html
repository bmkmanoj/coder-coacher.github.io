to figure out what set does is first do
experiments this is probably really the
most pleasant and the way that most
programmers would want to understand new
things experiments are limited so if you
really want to understand things you
probably need to read some documentation
as well or at least look for documents
on the web that might give you more
insight playing tennis probably fun and
you'll learn something about sets but a
different kind of set then we're using
in Python for the fourth choice well I
think the course forms are very valuable
and I definitely encourage you to use
them and to take advantage of other
people learning the same things but it's
not a great way to start it's really
good to try some things on your own
before you go to the course form and ask
for help</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
