blackbox testing or functional testing
which is the kind of testing to perform
when you just look at the description of
the software today we're going to cover
white box testing which is the kind of
testing that we perform when we open up
the box we look inside the program and
we actually test it based on its code
and there is one basic assumption behind
the idea of white box testing which is a
very intuitive one and the assumption is
that executing the faulty statement is a
necessary condition for revealing a
fault in other words if there is a bug
in the program there is no way we're
going to be able to find this bug or
this fault if we don't execute the
statement that contains it which makes a
lot of sense as we did for black box
testing we're going to start by
summarizing what are the main advantages
of white box testing the main advantage
is that it's based on the code and as
such the quality of white box testing
can be measured objectively and what I
mean here by objectively is that if you
think about black box testing in many
cases there were subjective decisions
that were had to be made in order to
define tests in a black box fashion in
the case of white box testing because
everything is based on the code we don't
have to make such subjective decisions
and similarly because white box testing
is based on the code it can be measured
automatically so we can build tools and
actually there are tools and there's
plenty of tools that can be measured the
level of white box testing achieved in a
fully automated way
and we're going to see some of them in
the course of the class another
advantage of white box testing is that
it can be used to compare test Suites so
if you have two alternative sets of
tests that you can use to assess the
quality of your software white box
testing techniques can tell you which
one of these two test Suites is likely
to be more effective in testing your
code and finally white box testing
allows for covering the coded behavior
of the software what that means is that
if there is some mistake in the code and
is not obvious by looking at the
specification of the code white box
testing might be able to catch it
because it tries to exercise the code
there's many different kinds of white
box testing
there are contraflow based techniques
data flow based techniques and fault
based techniques and for each one of
these family of techniques there are
many variations so this field is very
very broad in this lesson we will talk
about white box testing by focusing
mainly on control flow based testing
techniques</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
