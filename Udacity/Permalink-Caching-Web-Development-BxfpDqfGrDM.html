is add the same caching for the
permalink pages specifically on the same
way we did on the front page display the
age of the query that generated that
page on the page somewhere and I'll give
you a demo of how this works on my site
okay so if we go to one of these posts
we can see that this was queried zero
seconds ago and as I reload this page
this timer increments that's how it
should work and if I were to click on a
part to go to a different post we see
that this one is zero seconds ago and as
I reload this page this one increments
as well now in order for us to test this
we're probably going to submit some new
posts so make sure the slash new post
still works
ah and mine I've made it so you have to
log in as spez to submit your post so
you guys would quit submitting a spam to
my site but the rest of you should make
this accessible and if we submit a new
post like so this redirects to the
permalink page where we see we are zero
seconds old and when we when we go to
the front page we see our post here and
if we scroll down we can see how old our
caches which is 55 seconds and which is
about how much time it took me to go out
and ask Shawn to stop submitting spam to
my block while I'm recording and if we
go back to this permalink we can see
that it updates accordingly so when
you've got that working submit a URL to
your blog here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
