two-and-a-half years ago the biggest
thing that surprised me was that this
even existed honestly when I heard about
it I was just blown away I was like wait
people are putting this stuff online and
I can just take it I can just learn
computer science I really think that
being somebody who loves to learn is the
only way you could be a teacher I think
that my excitement for trying to learn
definitely comes across in my classes
the main thing we think about is
students first that's our motto it has
to be fun to learn or how can we expect
our students to enjoy our classes making
a class can be something that seems very
simple very straightforward but there's
actually a lot of people involved it's a
lot of thought a lot a lot of hard work
behind making a good class the most
important part of the course development
process to me is the first step where
you decide what you're going to teach
how do you approach will have you
choosing it so right now we're in the
planning phase and we're trying to
outline the class to get a really
holistic view of what's actually going
to go in the class so we're cutting
material we're adding material we're
trying to get a sense of what the
students actually going to see it's a
really fun creative part of the process
figuring out fun interactions that the
students can do like programming
exercises that the students will do or
even just like fun thought questions to
get them thinking what we're really
trying to do is make the class that has
the most relevance to the real world for
the students really trying to empathize
with who your target learner is going to
be and trying to understand where are
they were they in this you know
development towards being a computer
program or whatever their goal happens
to be where am I trying to take them and
really thinking what are the big
milestones from where they are to where
I'm trying to take them I think it's
really important to actually start by
thinking about the interactions from the
student rather than starting with you
know what dialog you want to say and
then throw in the interactions it feels
a lot more natural when when you know
what your goal is so you start by making
assumptions say this is my learner
is how she's feeling this is what she
knows then you try to empathize with her
based on your own personal experiences
and then you check all of those
hypotheses and assumptions by finding
representative learners like that and
creating paper prototypes of the course
that you've designed and bringing it to
them and letting them demolish your
ideas a little bit and learning from it
iterating and then bringing them back
with new versions of your ideas this is
what we did early on in the course which
is a lot of back-and-forth in terms of
acquiring feedback and iterating to
create a better product and I think we
do a really good job of supporting each
other and offering feedback when asked
for and asking for feedback proactively
all these sorts of things to just help
each other make the best stuff that we
can I'm always collaborating with my
fellow course developers we all sit
pretty close together in the office and
we're constantly bouncing ideas off each
other I will reach out to them NSA what
do you think about this is this
reasonable how would you improve upon
this after we have a good outline and a
good plan for the course we go in and
start drilling down the details until
we're ready for the production phase and
the production phase we start to record
so what we are going to do in this video
is work together to get Twilio the
things I enjoy most have to be the
collaboration the creativity if I like
the recording - we have a lot of fun
when we're recording it's pretty funny
in the recording studio thanks Oprah
hello hello my name is Cameron Pittman
and this is me talking okay well we're
tired it was a funny noise what was
supposed to be a recording session
turned into a surprise planning session
I guess like most other creative
processes everything takes a little bit
longer and requires a little bit more
review than you might originally think
so what you saw previously was
essentially the last bout of headshots
that we had to do and then
the next couple of weeks all we do is
just polish before the class actually
goes out and just going to start ticking
students are going to write some code
and then we have to write code that will
evaluate that and determine whether they
were correct it's really important to
give people feedback that actually is
sort of targeted at what they answered
rather than just being really generic I
often like to put in something that's
you know actually tailored to what they
did answer once the class launches
because you've been working really hard
you're done with the production and now
you have this thing online that people
are taking and they're in the forums and
they're you see them learning you see
them asking questions that are perfect
you see them asking questions that are
indicative of somewhere where you might
messed up and that's okay you go back
and you fix it but it's cool to see you
know after all this time and effort that
like 10,000 people are now learning
physics or computer science because of
all that work if you get it right then
the scale is just tremendous ah we're
talking about thousands of students
hundreds of thousands of students you
know I started just blown away at the
the existence of it and now having been
deep into the making of it for the last
two years oh it's not nearly enough that
things like this exist we have to do it
right like how do we use this amazing
thing the internet to make education
amazing and relevant and and accessible
like these are big questions and it's
very exciting to work on them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
