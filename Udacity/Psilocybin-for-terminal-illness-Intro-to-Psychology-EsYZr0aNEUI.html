tryptamine alkaloid it's the principal
psychoactive component of so-called
magic mushrooms philosophy genus of
mushrooms about a hundred species of
those mushrooms have been identified and
they've been used for literally for
thousands of years was in some cultures
for structured manners and for
divinatory and religious purposes
so recently research has been
reinitiated with psilocybin as a classic
hallucinogen and exploring some of its
potential for therapeutic application
and this work points back to research
done in the 1950s and 60s for two
different kinds of indications one was
in cancer patients primarily terminally
ill and the other was in the addictions
area primarily alcoholism and we
currently have studies in both those
areas going on at Johns Hopkins so in
the cancer patients we're investigating
the effects of a single psilocybin
session on the existential anxiety or
depressed mood that some patients
experience as a consequence of their
cancer diagnosis so as you may
appreciate any terminal diagnosis can be
very psychologically disruptive and a
fairly good percentage of people
confronted with such a diagnosis really
end up in despair and in reduced quality
of life we bring those individuals in
there very carefully screened prior to
participation and if they qualify for
the for the study then we give them an
opportunity to have a guided and
supported psilocybin session in our
laboratory the context is that people
lay down on
on a couch they have headphones and eye
shades they're asked to turn their
attention in on their inner experience
they're in the presence of two guides
our monitors four with whom they've
already developed a secure and
supportive relationship and those people
are there for the eight-hour session
just to provide a context of safety and
support under these conditions with very
high probability as we've seen in both
cancer patients and other studies that
we've run in healthy volunteers the
majority of people have what we call a
transcendent or mystical type experience
these are experiences that have actually
been well characterized in the general
research literature on religion they
occur naturally and they're
transformative in that they can alter
very dramatically someone's entire sense
of self and and attitudes towards life
and meaning the characteristics of these
experiences include a sense of unity or
a sense of the interconnectedness of all
people and things a sense of sacredness
reverence noetic sense that there's
something more true and more real about
this experience in everyday waking
consciousness positive mood often
accompanies these experiences often
experienced as deep gratitude or
sometimes the universal love a
transcendence of time and space occurs
that time collapses into the present
moment there's no past there's no future
it's it's beingness now finally these
experiences are said to be ineffable
people the first thing they say about
this kind of experience is you know I
can't even put it into words but with
these kinds of experiences can come
great psychological healing there's been
one recent published pilot study out of
UCLA we have this
while going at Johns Hopkins currently
and why you also has a cancer trial
going and we're really quite hopeful
that very systematic application of
psilocybin in this context could
transform end-of-life care not only for
cancer patients but ultimately for us
all for the cancer patients did they
report helping their relationship with
their family or to their families report
that the person was ready to pass on or
was there any family input on that yeah
so with the cancer patients one of the
really interesting outcomes is their
relationship to family in their in their
caregivers people come through these
kinds of experiences with a altered core
sense of self and their beingness in in
the world
it gives them deep inner strength and
and what's really remarkable and
touching is when then that deep inner
strength is communicated to their
caretakers so people can come through
this kind of experience and and be able
to say clear-eyed and emotionally open
you know I'm dying and and it's sad and
I am upset to be leaving and and leaving
you but it's also okay and and there's
something beautiful about this and
there's something absolutely okay and I
want you to know that right and and when
that's it it actually gets to me just
describing it but but when someone can
say that to their loved ones it has
remarkable healing direction both ways I
can imagine</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
