blocks that an SM can run let me digress
a bit to answer this question which
leads into the related topic of
occupancy you'll hear this term a lot if
you pay attention to the CUDA forums or
if you watch presentations on optimizing
CUDA code each SM has a limited number
of resources there's a maximum number of
thread blocks allowed on an SM turns out
to be eight on current GPUs there's a
maximum number of threads that a single
SM can run across all of the thread
blocks on it this number ranges on
modern GPUs from about 1,500 threads on
for example the fermi based GPUs that
you use on Amazon or up to 2048 threads
on the Kepler GPU in my laptop every
thread running a given kernel takes a
certain number of registers and there's
a total number of registers for all of
the threads on the sm equal to 64 K on
most GPUs and finally there's a limited
number of bytes of shared memory this is
going to be either 16 K or 48 K on
modern GPUs there's a maximum number of
8 thread blocks usually one of these
other things is going to get in the way
first the total number of threads that
you want to run across all the thread
blocks the total number of registers
that each thread is going to take and
the total number of bytes of shared
memory that each thread block wants to
use so for example if I'm running on a
GPU with 48 kilobytes of shared memory
and a single thread block in my kernel
requires 16 kilobytes of shared memory
then I can run at most 3 blocks on that
SM now if that same GPU has a maximum
number of threads of 1536 but my kernel
takes 1024 threads then I can only run
one block per SM so in this case even
though my kernel took a little enough
shared memory that I'd be able to get 3
blocks per SM the sheer number of
threads in my kernel is preventing me
from running more than one block per SM</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
