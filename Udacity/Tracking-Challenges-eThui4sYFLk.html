flow estimations in pairs of images now
one way of thinking about doing tracking
is if you had more than two images you
could do some form of optical flow or
some sort motion between one image in
the next and then you could just do it
between the second image and third and
Thermage to the fourth basically you
would just sort of follow the arrows
connect the dots so there are a couple
of challenges to just doing that one as
we saw it's hard to compute optical flow
everywhere you have to have just kind of
the right types of behavior for the
gradient in terms of being able to track
these features second there might be
large displacement so between one frame
in the next something may have moved a
lot and so there's a lot of search that
has to be done and so one way of doing
that is you might want to take the
dynamics into account how is this thing
moving make a prediction and in fact
that's what we're going to spend a lot
of time talking about over the next
couple lessons the other problem would
sort of connecting the dots is things
will drift that is you know I make a
little mistake and then a little Morris
take little own and eventually i'm no
longer tracking the thing that i have
started wanted to keep track of and then
finally another problem is what are
called occlusions or dis occlusions
right occlusion is when something gets
occluded dis occlusion maybe on
occlusions a better word basically it
appears from something so something
appears was it something that I lost
before or is it something new and how do
I do that kind of track</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
