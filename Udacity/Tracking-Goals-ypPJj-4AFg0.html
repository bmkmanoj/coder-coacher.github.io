goals you probably have some personal
goals for yourself by getting fit well
you can also set goals for your app for
example you might set a goal for users
to click the donate button or reach a
certain level in the game or stay
engaged with the app for a certain
amount of time hopefully not that long
to set goals for the app you go to the
admin interface and then in the view you
click goals and then create new goal
when you're setting up a goal you'll see
a list of templates if you choose a
template it fills in the name and the
type for you like this but even if you
choose a template you can change the
name and type anyway so I'm going to
start out by creating a custom goal and
you enter whatever name you want and
then you choose the type of goal so you
can specify a screen that you want the
users to reach or duration how long you
want them to stay engaged with your app
you can specify how many screens you
want them to visit in a session and you
can also specify an event like viewed
product or show recipe so I'm going for
five screens per session min so after
you set the name on the type you can add
more detail for the goals the details
you can set depend on the type of the
goal if the typist number of screens per
session well you choose how many you
want I want at least five that would be
greater than four if the type its
duration then you could specify criteria
for the duration how many hours minutes
seconds do you want the users to stay
engaged as a minimum if the goal type is
destination then you specified the
screen name and as you see there's some
flexibility around how you specify the
screen name you can give a regular
expression if you want and notice the
funnel option if you enable this you can
specify the progression through your app
that you want users to take to reach the
destination my advice is to start out
with the simpler options as you build
your understanding of an
to add in more complex tracking so for
now I'm not going to set up a funnel and
if the goal type is event then you
specify the category the action the
label and the value of the event and
actually you can specify any or all of
these starting with the category you
could just set the category and leave
the other values bank if you wanted so
i'm going to set up a goal called 5
screen so my users to visit 5 screens
per session so I've chosen the type
pages / screens per session and I want
them to go to at least 5 so that would
be greater than 4 then create the goal
so now my goal is listed in the list of
goals now you might be wondering do you
need to write code for the goals well it
depends is order activity tracking
enabled for your app if it is then you
don't need to write any code for screen
related goals analytics will get hits
for all screen views but if the goal
depends on other kinds of hits such as
event hits then your app must include
the code to send those hits if Otto
activity tracking is not enabled you
then your app must have the code to send
the hits that analytics needs to figure
out the goals are met or not and that
includes screen view hits because of
order activity tracking is not enabled
analytics won't get screen view hits
other than the ones get explicitly sent
by the app so I've created one golf my
app so far but each app has a limit to
how many goals it can have after you
create a goal you can't delete it
there's no point hunting rounds the
delete button because it isn't there
however you can edit an existing goal
and change it completely so I'm going to
change my goal my new goal is for users
to read the recipe for dinner suggestion
there are two ways to express this goal
either I can set a goal for users to
click the show recipe button or I can
set a goal for users to go to the show
recipe activity or screen so i'm going
to set a goal
for my users to go to show recipe as a
destination now my app sends a screen
view hit through the code in the onstart
method of the show recipe activity so I
need to make sure that the screen name
in the goal is the same as the one that
gets set in the code and see here how it
sets verify this goal you can click on
this to see what the conversion rate
would have been for the data for the
past seven days so this is only going to
be helpful if you actually have a bunch
of data from the past seven days and it
has to be exactly the past seven days
but not including today so now I'm going
to save my goal and there it is now my
app already sends a screen view hit for
the show recipe activity so I don't need
to make any changes in my code so i
already have the app running on the
phone and I didn't even need to redeploy
it I'm going to go ahead and show if you
the recipe a few times then I'm going to
need to wait a while for the goals to
show up in the analytics dashboard the
real-time view in analytics doesn't show
goal conversion so you may need to wait
a while for the goals to show up</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
