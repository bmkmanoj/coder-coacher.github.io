take really smart people and you define
a set of problems and you throw them at
the problem and you really empower them
amazing things can happen so I learned
that from Google the importance of like
creating great culture that empowers
people the importance of hiring really
smart people I think I also learned some
anti patterns though which is funny that
don't work as well at startups the great
thing about Google and one reason it's
able to be this engineering playground
is it discovered early on search and how
to monetize search so it has this money
printing machine in the form of search
ads Adwords and that funds everything
else wouldn't you want the same as oh
yeah except you don't you don't have
that you have you know a runway from
your venture capitalists or the revenue
that you generate and for us at Polyvore
you know that was something I always
thought about and I really wanted to
build a sustainable company that was a
real business so I was you know we
actually got to profitability it was
really proud of that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
