it was built by a company called Jenga
to power a website called live journal
and before Facebook took over the world
live journal was a very popular site
where people had um you know their own
blocks kind of like Tumblr or blogspot I
don't know a bunch of bunch of things
that have have risen to take the place
of live journal but live journal is a
very popular site back in the day and
when I say back in the day I mean 2003
is when memcached was released now just
about every website on the internet uses
memcache these days I don't know about
Google but certainly it's used by
Facebook juice by Reddit you know it's
used by YouTube Twitter it is an
essential piece of software when you're
writing web applications and in fact
other than then Linux itself memcache is
probably the piece of software that's
most in common between every website
online it's pretty astounding home it's
very very simple and it's very very
effective at what it does
okay so to draw a bigger version of that
picture I did on the quiz how men cached
if it's in it looks something like this
memcache is a process often you run it
on its own machine but you can also run
it on the machines with your app servers
and it's it's a very simple system the
algorithm doesn't change you know a
request comes in you know we check
memcached if our response is there we
you know sent it back to the user if it
isn't there you know we check our
database instead and right to memcache
you know as we've been doing that the
algorithm should be pretty familiar to
you by now
what's handy about it is all of these
app servers can interact with memcached
memcache is fast enough and can support
many many sockets that it works very
well in the scenario also most memcache
libraries have built into it this notion
of having multiple memcache machines
because memcached is just a key value
store just it's like basically a giant
hash table you can hash on the keys to
decide which server to send your data to
and because it's a cache it's okay if
you you know lose data from time to time
because you'll just get it you'll get
the authoritative copy out of the
database and this distribution of keys
over multiple servers is generally
handled by the library you know
sometimes you have to do it yourself but
most libraries in the Python library
will be using in this class
this abstract solve this for you so you
don't have to deal with it it's very
common to actually run a little memcache
server on each machine and then have
each app server you know communicate to
all of the caches and you kind of get
this big ball of this big ball of
connections but everything works out
okay so none cache is a very simple
protocol and the operations it does are
very simple so ultimately we're gonna be
storing you know keys to values where
the keys and values are both strings in
the operations looks something like this
we've got set and this takes a key and a
value we've got get this takes a key and
returns a value and we've got delete
which takes a key and deletes the key
there are other operations and they're
actually a few other parameters here but
these are the basic ones and you can see
with these three main operations set get
and delete we could actually implement
all the caching we've been doing an
ASCII Chan in a system that will scale a
lot better than having you know just a
dictionary in our process it also means
that if the advantage we get from using
memcache is if our process restarts we
don't have an empty dictionary anymore
we have our memcached and our content
lives on so what I'd like you to do
first is implement a fake version of
memcached</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
