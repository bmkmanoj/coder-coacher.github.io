of the virtual memory manager it looks
like this that you have a process object
that is equivalent to a PCB in the
traditional setting and of course as a
TLB on the processor that's going to be
maintained either in hardware or
software depending on the architecture
because some architectures do it in
Hardware some architectures leave it up
to the software to manage the TLB and
the region object is as I said a portion
of the address space so essentially the
page table data structure is split into
these region objects and the region
object there is a file cache manager
that knows the location of the files on
the backing store that corresponds to a
particular region so the file cache
manager is responsible for backing this
region and this file cache manager
interacts with the dealer manager in
order to get a physical frame because
when there is a page fault in a
particular region the file cache manager
has to contact the drm object in order
to get a physical page frame and once it
gets the physical page frame it kicks
off this cor which we said is the cached
object representation of a page its
kicks off this CEO or object to say well
here is a page frame for you and here is
the page on the disk go do it and it is
a responsibility of the cached object
representation to populate the physical
page frame by doing io with the disc in
order to move this page from the disk
representation into a memory
representation so this is sort of the
structure of the object heist virtual
memory manager and depending on the
region of the virtual memory space that
you are accessing the path that a
particular page fault may take may be
different if you are accessing a page
that is in the green region then this is
a path that is going to be taken by the
page fault handler and similarly if the
page fault happens to be in the purple
region then this is a path that is going
to be taken by the page fault handler so
logically given the structure let's
think
what is the workflow in handling a page
fault with this object I structure of
the virtual memory manager the thread t1
is executing poor guy it incurs a page
fault and when it incurs a page fault it
goes to the process object and the
process object is able to say given the
virtual page number what region is that
particular page fault falling into so
that's the region that we want to go to
in order to serve as the page fault so
that region object is then going to
contact the file cache manager that
corresponds to this region object and to
the file and the file cache manager is
going to do two things one it's going to
see what exactly is the backing file for
that particular virtual page that is
missing so it may be that it is a file
that contains multiple pages and so it's
going to say file and offset and that is
going to be the information that has to
be passed on to the COR object saying
that here is the file and here's the
offset in the file and that's where the
faulting page content can be found on
the storage device and of course fcm has
to get a physical frame so it contacts
the DRAM object in order to get a
physical frame and so once it has the
physical frame and it has the actual
location of the file then the sea or
object can perform the i/o and pull the
data from the disk into the DRAM and so
now the p frame the page frame that has
been allocated for backing this
particular virtual page has now
populated because as I 0 being complete
so the green arrows are showing you the
completion of the i/o as a result of
that you've got the page frame
containing the contents of the virtual
page that is missing in the first place
and once that is available then fcm can
indicate to the region that your page
fault service is complete and at that
point the region can go through the
process object in order to update the
tlv in order to indicate that now there
is a mapping between the virtual page in
the physic
frame that has been populated in
physical memory and now the process can
be resumed so this is the the flow of
information in order to make the process
runnable again which faulted in the
first place on a virtual page that is
missing in physical memory so now that
we have this flow and we also mentioned
that the cluster object has a single
representation when it is a region it's
a region now how do we replicate a
region object should this be a singleton
object should be replicated should this
region object be a singleton object
should it be replicated if you're going
to replicate it should it be replicated
for every core or a set of processors or
a group of processors and so on these
are all the design decisions that the
operating system designer has to make so
let's look at the process object the
process object is mostly read-only and
you can replicate it one per CPU it's
like a process control block and you can
make it one per CPU and all the cores on
the CPU can share this process object
because ultimately the TLB is a common
entity for the entire processor and
since the process object is updating the
TLB you can have a single process object
that manages the TLB what about the
region object well let's think about
this now region represents a portion of
the address space now a portion of the
address space may be traversed by more
than one thread so a set of threads that
are running on a group of processors may
actually access a portion of this
address space and we don't know a priori
how many threads may actually access a
particular region it's something that
may have to evolve over time but it is
definitely a candidate for partial
replication that is it is in the
critical path of a page fault and so
let's partially replicate the region not
one per process or but maybe for a group
of processors because a group of
processors may be running threads that
are accessing the same portion of the
address space and so we will replicate
this region object one for every group
of processors and the granularity of
replication decides exploitable
and currency from parallel page fault
handling now the interesting thing to
notice is that the degree of replication
and the design decision that we take for
how we cluster the degree of clustering
that we choose for every one of these
objects is independent of one another so
when we talked about the process object
we said that well the process object can
be one per CPU and I said for religion
object could be replicated for a group
of processes now what about the FCM
object FCM object is backing a region
there may be multiple replicas of this
region but all of those regions are
backed by the same FCN and therefore
what we can do is the portion of the
address space that is being backed by a
particular FCM can be partitioned so we
can go for a partitioned representation
of this fcn where a partition represents
the portion of the address space that is
managed by this particular FCM so you
can see that there is a degree of
freedom in how we choose to replicate
the process object how we choose to
replicate the region objects of course
we are partitioning the region objects
but once we partition it how we have
replications for each of each of these
partition regions is something that is
up for grabs as an OS designer and
similarly for the file cache manager
because it is backing a specific region
we can go for a partitioned
representation of the FCM and what about
the COR the cached object representation
now now this object is the one that is
really dealing with physical entities it
is actually doing the i/o from the disk
into the physical memory and since we
are dealing with physical entities it
may be appropriate to have a true shared
object for a cached object
representation and the all the i/o is
going to be managed by this cached
object representation even though I am
showing you two different boxes here in
principle it could be a singleton object
that is managing all of the i/o
activities that corresponds to the
virtual memory management and what about
the drm object now the lead I'm object
you can have several representations for
this DRAM object depend
on how the physical memory is managed
for example we may have at least one
representation of the DRAM object for
every DSM piece that you have in a
single notes portion of the physical
memory so in other words we can break up
the entire physical memory that's
available in the entire system into the
portions that are managed individually
by each processor and there could be a
dram object that corresponds to the
physical memory that is managed by each
of those processors but you can go even
finer than that if it is appropriate but
it is a design decision that is up to
the designer so we come up with a
replicated process object a partial
replication for the region object a
partition representation for the FCM
object and maybe a true shared object
for cor and several representations for
the dram object so this is one way of
thinking about it but the nice thing
about this object I structure is that
when we designed the object I structure
we did not have to think about how we
going to replicate it when we actually
populate these objects that is a level
of design decision that can be a
deferred because of the secret sauce
that's available in tornado which is a
clustered object</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
