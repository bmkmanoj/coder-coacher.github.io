that the keys and the nodes map to the
same ID space so what we're going to do
is create a metric space such as a ring
and we'll put nodes on this ring and the
idea is that these nodes each have some
ID now the keys should also map to the
ID space so in this case just for the
sake of example let's suppose that we
have a six bit ID space so IDs might
range from 0 to 63 now you can see that
the nodes have IDs and the keys also
have IDs in the same space a consistent
hash function will assign the nodes and
the keys and identifiers in this space a
hash function such as sha-1 might be
used to assign these identifiers in the
case of nodes the ID might be a hash of
the IP address in the case of keys the
ID might simply just be the hash of a
key both of these hash operations create
IDs that are uniformly distributed in
the ID space the question now is how to
map the key IDs to the node IDs so that
we know which nodes are responsible for
resolving the lookups for a particular
key the idea in cord is that a key is
stored at its successor which is the
node with the next highest ID so for
example the key corresponding to the key
ID of 60 would be stored at the node
with the node ID of 1 similarly for the
key with the key ID of 54 42 would be
stored at the node with the node idea of
43 17 at the node with 32 7 and 5 at the
node with ID of 10 and so on consistent
hashing offers the properties of load
balance because all nodes receive
roughly the same number of keys and
flexibility because when a node joins or
leaves the network only a fraction of
the keys need to be moved to a different
location you can actually prove that the
solution is optimal meaning that the
minimal number of keys need to be
remapped to maintain load balance when a
node joins or leaves the network</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
