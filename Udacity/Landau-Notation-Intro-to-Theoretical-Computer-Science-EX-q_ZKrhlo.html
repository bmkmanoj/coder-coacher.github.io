landau notation named after the german
mathematician edmond landau he didn't
invent the notation which was done
several years before him by another term
in mathematician called paul bachmann
but he popularized it in the 20th
century and in a way this is actually
quite ironic that he should have
popularized a notation that contains so
much approximation as Big O notation
because Edmond Lundell was actually
known as one of the most exact and
pedantic mathematicians his goal was to
be uncompromisingly rigorous in his
lectures that he used to give he even
had an assistant who always attended his
lectures and was instructed to interrupt
him if he even omitted the slightest
detail so it's interesting that he
introduced a notation that omits all of
the details</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
