solve this problem is to solve for the
acceleration of the proton in this
electric field so we know that the force
on the proton is equal to the strength
of the electric field e times its charge
Q and we also know that the force is
equal to the mass times acceleration so
we get this equation here and solving
for a I get that the acceleration is
equal to the electric field strength
times the charge of the proton over the
protons mass awesome now that I have the
acceleration this problem just becomes a
kinematics problem so I chose to use
this kinematics equation here and we
know that the proton has no initial
velocity so this term drops out and now
I just want to solve for the time here
and doing some algebra here I find that
the time it takes for the proton to move
from here to here is equal to the square
root of two times the separation between
the plates d over the acceleration a and
I know what the acceleration is we just
found it up here so plugging in that
value for acceleration I get this
equation for the time here and putting
in my numbers i find that the time it
takes for the proton to move from the
left to the right side of the plate is
equal to four point five seven times ten
to the minus seven seconds which is
equal to 457 nanoseconds good work</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
