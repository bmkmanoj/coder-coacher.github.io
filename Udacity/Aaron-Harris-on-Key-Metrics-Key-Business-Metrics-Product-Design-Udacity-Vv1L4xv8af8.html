are the things that startups should
measure such an important questions
actually the first the first
conversation we have with startups when
they get into Y Combinator the first
time we sit down with them we say what's
your metric because Y Combinator runs
for three months you know they get in
it's really four months from the time
again in five months in the time they
get in but they have demo day at the end
of that when they get up in front of a
roomful of very intelligent people and
they show their progress and the more
progress they can show honestly the
better that demo goes and the better
their follow-up conversations go so you
have to figure it out and it's different
for every company now there are
variations on themes right there are
their basic themes that everyone looks
at ah you know if you're a company that
should be generating revenue you're
metric is probably revenue if you're a
social product it's probably users or
some function of engagement if you are a
transaction site it's probably something
about the number of transactions you do
or the volume of transactions which by
the way is just a proxy for revenue
because you probably take it cut of it
so it's particular to different startups
I think the critical thing is to make
sure it's the thing that actually
reflects whether or not you're
succeeding as a business and not what we
call vanity metrics you know and what's
the hard part about like setting the
metrics and measuring them it's
everything right so I think on one level
it's hard to choose you know you start
out as a company and you think to
yourself oh there's all these different
things I want to accomplish right I want
to hire people I want to raise money
raising money by the way probably the
biggest vanity metric of all basically
meaningless for the success of your
company except it gives you money to
achieve the metrics you need so you know
you think that you think that you want a
lot of people you want a lot of press
you want all these things and they will
feel good but they don't necessarily
matter to your business right so so
that's the first part like ignoring all
that vanity is hard the hardest part
though is once you pick a metric being
honest about it and sticking to it and
and setting you know timeframes for
success and for progress that you
actually stick to so we tell companies
that during Y Combinator
they should grow whatever their metric
is between five and ten percent a week
we try to say go for 7% a week if you do
more great if not not and that's great
for consumer companies and if they're if
they're sticking to that the thing that
happens and this is something that
people miss a lot they say oh all you
care about is growth but growth isn't a
one-dimensional thing right growth is a
function of the fact that you've done
everything else properly you build a
product that people want it got it into
their hands you supported it it
continues to be something that they want
to use that's what leads to growth so
you can you know you can't isolate it if
you miss it that's when it gets hard
because then you have to be honest with
yourself about why you missed that goal
why you missed your metric and that'll
make you fix your business</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
