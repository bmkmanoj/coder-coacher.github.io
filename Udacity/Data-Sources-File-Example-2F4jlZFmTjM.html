the lesson to become a bit more familiar
with all tricks since we'll be using all
tricks for a good part of this course to
demonstrate how to build an analytic
data set let's explore some basic
capabilities so that when you go to use
it you're a little more comfortable with
the tool we're first going to get
familiar with how to bring data into
alteryx to start I'm going to simply
click on the input data tool and drop it
onto the canvas next I'll click over to
the configuration window and then to the
drop down arrow and choose file browse
from here you can see the various file
types supported by the electric software
next I'm going to navigate to where the
sample data is located for all tricks
choose a file click on open and then
choose the sheet that says output dollar
sign and then okay we can see the data
on the left in the preview window and
the file is now open in all tracks now
that we know how to open a file in all
tricks let's look at a few additional
functionalities that will allow us to
explore the data file further let's
practice building a workflow in all
tricks let's say your boss asks you to
tell her how many customers are in the
Denver market as a start it'd be
interesting to know how many records
total are in the file this can be done
really easily by simply running the
workflow we do this by clicking on the
play button or hidden control are on the
keyboard once the workflow is ren we can
navigate to the results window click on
the messages icon and see that 2669
records were read in from the file by
clicking on the output icon we can see
the data and the fields in the file but
our boss is only interested in analyzing
the customers who are in Denver we can
use the filter tool to isolate these
customers out of the larger dataset we
pull the filter tool onto the canvas and
select the citi field in the basic
filter in the box to the right of equals
we enter Denver the filter tool has two
outputs a tea or true side and an F or
false side the true side outputs the
records where the expression evaluated
to true so these are the records where
the city is Denver there are 11 hundred
and sixty-six records in that list if
you click on the false side you can see
the rest of the records for the other
cities</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
