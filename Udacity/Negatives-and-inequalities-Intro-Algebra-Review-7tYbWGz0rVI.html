if you struggled a bit with this one let
me show you how we did it so to solve
this we started with negative 4x is less
than 16 just like with a regular linear
equation we're trying to isolate X and
we should do this by dividing by
negative 4 both sides and when we do
that we're left with X is less than
negative 4 because 16 divided by
negative 4 is negative 4 but this
actually isn't quite right let's think
about it to check our work we should
think of a number that is actually less
than negative 4 so for example negative
5 which is less than negative 4 if I
plug that back into negative 4x is less
than 16 i get negative 4 times negative
5 is less than 16 negative 4 times
negative 5 is positive 20 remember
negative times a negative is positive
and so then we get 20 is less than 16
but that's not a true statement 20 is
actually greater than 16 not less than
16 anytime you multiply or divide both
sides of inequality by a negative number
you have to flip the inequality sign
write this down it's important that's
why the solution here is actually x is
greater than negative 4</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
