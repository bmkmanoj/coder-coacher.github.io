be acorns what I've learned is that
going to these annual celebrations the
big-time acorns are life that's where
food comes from and just the celebration
around it it's a gathering of people
it's grinding them it's leeching them
and the baskets the basket weaving there
are baskets that are made for leaching
their baskets made for gathering storing
so to me I would say acorns would be a
big significant item to the meat what
people so around the region where Miwok
are there the black acorns the black
black oak acorns and they just have a
sweeter taste when you leach out the
tannins soak them there they have a
sweeter taste then I don't want to say a
regular oak tree but you know a
different type of oak tree that is more
bitter it's a bitter taste you can make
soups bread one of the interviews that I
did with my grandmother and I had no
idea about this we had a whole plot of
land up in Ione and my great-grandmother
would go out into the backyard and she
would dig a hole and line it with like
cheesecloth and she would leach acorns
in our backyard she would make soups she
would make bread I think she would even
make tortillas out of them but oh and a
corn mush but yeah that was something
that I never knew and my grandma's share
with me one day and it's like you just I
would never have known that just in the
backyard where I grew up they're worth
leaching of acorns</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
