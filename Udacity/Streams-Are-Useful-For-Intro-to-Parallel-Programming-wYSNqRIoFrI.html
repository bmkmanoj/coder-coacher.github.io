for sometimes you need to perform a
computation on a really big hunk of data
and be so big that it won't even fit
into the GPU memory no problem you say
I'll break up the data into chunks that
will fit on GPU memory I'll copy each
chunk over do my processing and then
copy each chunk back then I'll do the
same thing with the next chunk and so on
and this will work fine and it'll get
the job done but the problem is if this
is a high end GPU you can easily have
several gigabytes of memory and so these
copy operations where you're copying
several gigabytes of data enough to fill
the GPU memory do your processing and
then copying several gigabytes of data
back these copy operations can end up
taking a significant amount of the time
of your total computation you see our
problem if this is the time line we
spend some time copying can we spend
some time processing so we spend some
time copying back and the process
repeats so here's where I synchronous
copies can come to the rescue
instead we can break up our data into
chunks that are half the size and we can
do an asynchronous copy filling half the
GPU and we can launch some kernels on a
GPU to start processing that data and
immediately do another asynchronous copy
filling the rest of the GPU data and
immediately start processing that data
when the first chunk of data completes
we'll copy it back and start copying the
next half sized chunk of data all while
this one is still completing so you get
the idea we're going to copy over half
the data at a time and immediately start
processing it while we copy the next
half of the data
now the timeline looks like this and the
important point is that we're managing
to overlap data transfers and
computation</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
