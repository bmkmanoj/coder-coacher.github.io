to talk about because it's always this
doom and gloom issue as you and I are
both aware right it's the idea that
robots are taking all of our jobs
everywhere you look it seems like lately
there's another article that's popping
up and saying robots are going to take
all of our jobs by 2030 you know 80% of
the jobs in the US are going to be
automated factory farm workers are going
to be out of their jobs in the next two
years right like it's always to this
level of like it's here and it's
happening now and everything is going
away and in time to go grab you know
your pitchforks and rise up against the
robots before everything goes doom and
gloom what are your thoughts on kind of
this you know portrayal in the media
that you know robots are here to take
everything away from people and people
are going to be able to afford you know
a life for their families then there's
this concept of taxation on top of these
robots ok the bonfire the robots issue
it is so completely wrong
anybody who's developed robots has a
much greater appreciation of just how
far behind that state we are I believe
there is still fewer than 2 million
industrial robots in the world global
total today
and that's with China putting a huge
amount of money into it so that they're
now have this year become I think the
world's largest producer of robots as
well as the world's largest consumer of
robots pushing Germany out of the top
spot and yet the sum total 2 million ok
it's going to take quite a while for us
to spread sophisticated robotics
technology around the globe and then I
think the other thing is to look at
certain industries and you mentioned
farm workers if you were to mention that
in an agricultural area you would have
everybody that owned a farm saying can I
have some of those because I can't get
enough workers and to look at the labor
statistics almost every country in the
world has an ageing population problem
and it is worst in rural
occupations so you're pretty much going
to have every farmer in the world
retiring in the next five to ten years
and at the same time we're shutting down
all of the cheap labor sources and
seasonal labor sources that used to be
so how are we going to prevent the world
from starving and yet keep food prices
you know at the level that we expect
them to be and you know we really do
have to look at doubling food production
over the next generation not just
keeping things as they are either so I
see some huge areas where we actually
have big problems we have global
challenges that we need to do something
about so whenever people talk about
robots as a problem I stop and I go well
what are the world's biggest problems
and will robotics have a role to play in
solving fixing or you know making those
problems a little bit better and I think
absolutely yes and if anyone is on the
fence then focus on the ways that we
need to solve these problems and think
about the creative technologies that we
have to put into play to fix global
challenges and I think that's the most
productive thing you can do with your
time rather than to you know spend it
worried or or in fear which first off I
don't think is founded but second off
you see if you've got that energy there
is a lot of good things that you can do
so focus on those and yeah and and not
on that fear well that's it for today on
you'd ask these explorers human robot
interaction and robotic ethics Andre Kay
thank you very much for your time we
appreciate it thanks so much Mike</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
