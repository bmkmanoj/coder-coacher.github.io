properly display is by this block of
code here currently all the circles are
overlapping in the top left of the
screen and visually don't have any
representation because we haven't set a
radius or a fill for them so what's
happening in this code here is we're
saying find me all the circles on the
web page which there's 836 of them there
change the CX attribute of the circle
which stands for Center X so change the
exposition of the circle according to
the anonymous accessor function and
again since this function gets passed d
a different bound data object every time
it's called we can position every circle
at a completely different place on our
chart corresponding to what's actually
contained in its bound data in this case
the pattern to do this in d3 is to take
your scale object and pass in the column
that corresponds to in this case the
x-axis so since our x axis corresponds
to the date of the game we pass the date
which in this case is a JavaScript date
object to our time scale which converts
it from a date object to a pixel value
and return that from our anonymous
accessor function to set the x position
of that circle again that was quite a
lot so let's explore this in the web
console by inserting a debugger
statement refreshing the page and
jumping to the debugger inside of our
anonymous accessor function we can now
inspect what D is in this case we've
broken on the first game so game one
which has attendance 25,000 looking at D
date we have a JavaScript date object
corresponding to May 27th of the year in
1934 but again d3 needs a pixel value to
know where to actually draw this circle
we can't say draw the circle at position
may twenty seventh and the way to go
from a date in this case to a pixel
value for argument chart is to use the
time scale we created earlier so in this
case may
27th 1934 happens to correspond to x
pixel position 132 dot six and so forth
and looking at the rest of the code here
we set the x position of the center of
the circle to correspond to the
attendance column so again whatever
attribute we're trying to set in this
case cy gets set to be whatever gets
returned from the accessor function for
an individual data point</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
