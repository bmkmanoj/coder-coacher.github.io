operates under the same principles as
DFS on trees keep in mind that a graph
search and a graph traversal are roughly
the same thing in a traversal you look
at every element and in a search you
just stop traversing when you find the
element you were looking for unlike a
tree there's no root in a graph so
there's no obvious place to start you
can begin with any node first mark the
node you selected as seen a common
implementation of DFS uses a stack so we
can store the node we just saw on the
stack next you pick an edge follow it
and mark that node as seen and add it to
the stack as long as there are more
edges and more unseen nodes you keep
repeating those steps when you do hit a
node that you've seen before just go
back to the previous node and try
another edge if you've run out of edges
with new nodes you pop the current node
from the stack and go back to the one
before it which is just the next one on
the stack you continue this approach
until you've popped everything off the
stack or you find the node you were
originally looking for there's another
common implementation of DFS that uses
recursion and no stack as you can
imagine you just repeat the same process
of picking an edge and marking a note as
seen until you run out of new nodes to
explore that becomes the base case and
you move back to the last level of
recursion which happens to be the
previous node in the search in this
algorithm we're explicitly visiting
every edge and vertex once
thus the runtime is often written as
this which reads the number of edges
plus the number of vertices you might
notice that we actually visit every edge
twice once to explore it and once
traveling back through it the runtime is
technically tewi but the approximated
version remains the same the number of
edges by itself actually summarizes the
runtime pretty well but the V is added
to account for the
I'm taken to look up a vertex that exact
time varies depending on your choice of
data structure so be careful to base it
on your implementation when asked</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
