looking for in a company I think can
boil down to three questions the first
is is the market big enough is there
enough opportunity out there for a
company to go out and succeed the second
question is is the problem that you're
trying to solve something that's
important is it something that a lot of
people believe is an actual problem that
needs to be solved and the third thing
is is your company best position to
solve that problem better than anybody
else and you have to ask yourself those
three questions there's one other thing
you have to look at and that is that for
early stage investors they're looking
for a 20 to 100 * return on their money
and when you think about your problem
and you think about taking money and
what you will ultimately be able to
return you have to ask yourself the
question can you return that much money
to the investor and if you can't then
you probably need to go back and
reevaluate the problem that you're
trying to solve</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
