just went through in deriving the
geometric series I'm now going to write
down a bunch of math and what I'm going
to do is I'm just going to say it at you
and you're going to interrupt me if it
doesn't make sense okay that makes sense
it does okay so here's the first thing
I'm going to write down I've decided
that by going through this exercise of
of utilities and this kind of reward we
can now write down what the optimal
policy is the optimal policy which is
you recall is simply PI star it's simply
the one that maximizes our long-term
expected reward which looks like white
well looks like this there's that make
sense let me think so we have an
expected value of the sum of the
discounted rewards at time T and given
PI meaning that we're going to be
following pi so these are the the
sequence of states we're going to see in
a world where we follow pi and it's an
expectation because things are
non-deterministic or maybe
non-deterministic and do we know which
state we start in it doesn't matter it's
whatever s0 is I see whatever s0 is but
isn't that random I mean s1 and s2 s3
those are all random well we start in
some state it doesn't matter so tea is
starting out at 0 and going to infinity
ok does this make sense yes so then so
we're saying I would like to know the
policy that maximizes the value of that
expression right it gives us the highest
expected reward right yeah that's the
kind of policy I would want exactly so
good we're done we know what the optimum
policy is except that it's not really
clear what to do with this all we've
really done is written down what we knew
it was we were trying to solve but it
turns out that we've defined utility in
such a way that it's going to help us to
solve this so let me write that down as
well I'm going to say that the utility
of a particular sequence of a particular
state ok well it's going to depend upon
the policy that we're following so I'm
going to rewrite the utility to take as
a superscript PI and that's simply going
to be the expected set of states that
I'm going to see from that point on
given that I follow a policy there does
that make sense
feels like the same thing I
the difference now is that you're saying
now we're saying the utility of the
policy at a state is what happens if we
start running from that state yep and we
follow that policy got it right so this
answers the question you asked me before
about well what's s0 well we talked
about that in terms of the utility of a
state so how good is it to be in some
state well that's exactly is good to be
in that state as what we will expect to
see from that point on given that we're
following up with specific policy where
we started in that state is any sense
yeah
very important point here Michael is
that the reward for entering a state is
not the same thing as the utility for
that state right and then in particular
what reward gives us is immediate
gratification or immediate feedback okay
but utility gives us long-term feedback
does that make sense
so when a reward for a state is the
actual value that we get for being in
that state the utility for a state is
both the reward that we get for that
state but also all the reward that we're
going to get from that point on I see so
yeah that seems like a really important
difference like if I say here's a dollar
you know would you poke the president of
your university in the eye you'd be like
okay the immediate reward for that is
one but the long-term utility of that
could be actually quite low right on the
other hand I say well why don't you go
to college and you say but that's going
to cost me $40,000 or better yet why
don't you get a master's degree in
computer science from Georgia Tech you
can say but that's going to cost me
$6,600 yes but at the end of it you will
have a degree and by the way it turns
out that the average starting salary for
people getting our master's degree
versus our undergraduate degree is about
$45,000 so is it considered product
placement if you plug your own product
within the product itself no I'm just
simply stating facts Michael this is all
I'm doing it's just facts this is called
fact placement the point is there's a
immediate negative reward of say sixty
six hundred dollars for going through a
degree or maybe it's ten thousand
dollars by the time the 15th person sees
this
but anyway it's some cost but presumably
it's okay to go to college or go to grad
school or whatever because at the end of
it you're going to get something
positive out of it so it's not just that
it says it prevents you from taking
short-term positive things if that's
going to lead to long-term negative
things it also allows you to take
short-term negatives if it's going to
lead to long-term positives that make
sense right and what this does is this
gets us back to what I mentioned earlier
which is this notion of delayed reward
so we have this notion of reward but
utilities are really about accounting
for all delayed rewards and if you think
about that I think you can begin to see
how given you have a mathematical
expression for delayed rewards you will
be able to start dealing with the credit
assignment problem cool ok so let's keep
going in write more equations</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
