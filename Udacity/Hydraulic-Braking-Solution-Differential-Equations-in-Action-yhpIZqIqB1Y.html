model the zig zagging oscillation of the
brake pressure was to create this
parameter called brake change just for
simplicity we set the initial value of
brake change to zero but as we move down
into the for loop you can see that brake
change alternates between having a value
of 1 and negative 1 if the wheel slip
falls below the constant low slip then
the brake change values which is 21 and
as soon as the wheel slip passes Haislip
brake change switches signs and becomes
negative 1 makes mention for be after
the next time step we've ensured that be
will not drop below zero by setting 0 as
the minimum value that it can take on
then using this mid method right here
we're ensuring that its magnitude will
not exceed max break however anywhere in
between zero and max break it will take
on this value right here we take the
value of B at the previous step and add
to its step size times brake change
which I that are going to make this a
positive or negative quantity and
multiply that by the hydraulic speed
remember that hydraulic speed is just
the rate of change of the strength of
the break to visualize what we've done
let's look at our plots this bottom
graph shows how the break strength
changes with time just as we hoped we
see that our line either has a negative
slope or a positive slope but of the
same magnitude just alternating signs
these changes in sign correspond to the
flip in the sign of brake change the
crest of the break strength curve are
points at which brake change switches
from being positive to being negative in
our code we see that brake change
switches to negative 1 if the wheel slip
exceeds the value Haizlip and if we look
up at the corresponding values in wheel
slip you see that these points a
transition and break strength correspond
to the highest values in wheel slip and
these lowest values of wheel slip which
we can see signal switch and brake
change to positive 1 correspond to a
change in the sign of the slope of break
strength from negative to positive
zooming out and looking at these plots
as a whole we see that the wheel slip is
controlled very nicely but the value of
B does oscillate very strongly and this
would look pretty stressful for the
brake mechanism what we would want
instead would be a value of B that would
be close to the correct value one option
for this would be to limit the range of
B by holding the pressure constant or
keeping the value of B constant when
begets either too large or too small
let's try that out by making a small
change nerd code for just a second I'm
going to comment out this line and
instead implement
this line while our original line of
code kept the value of be between zero
and Max break we're now going to replace
those respectively with 100 and 150 so b
is going to be within a much smaller
range of values now let's see what
happens with this change the first thing
that I noticed when I looked at this is
that as you would expect the graph of
the break strength doesn't look like a
lot put nearly as much strain and stress
in the braking system as our previous
system did the wheel slip also still
stays within a very nice range in our
car does come to a complete stop despite
the improvements that this would allow
which requires some additional knowledge
that might be difficult to find we have
to be able to predict a reasonable range
for be depending on current road
conditions and we would also have to
measure the hydraulic pressure of the
break there are cheaper options that we
could consider such as looking at the
deceleration of the wheel to decide when
to stop increasing or decreasing the
pressure and to hold the pressure
constant instead I hope you've enjoyed
this brief introduction into the
intricacies of actuators with discrete
dynamics unfortunately this is the end
of our work for now with cars and
braking systems we're moving on to
something very exciting wildfires I know
that playing with fire is risky but
luckily we're doing all of it on
computers so we don't really have much
to worry about get ready for some very
interesting problems and great job on
this unit</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
