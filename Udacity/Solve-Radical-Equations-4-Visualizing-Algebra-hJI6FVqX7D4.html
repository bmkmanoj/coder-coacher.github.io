great work if you got that one correct
now if you didn't quite know how to
handle this for let's see how to do it
then you can pause the video once you
figure it out and then continue solving
to start we'll square both sides of the
equation so we can undo the square root
we square for which equals 16 and then
we square the radical which gives us the
quantity X minus 1 just this radicand on
the right side we square the binomial 8
minus 2x this gives us this polynomial
will distribute the 16 on the left side
of the equation to get 16x minus 16 on
the right hand side I'll just rearrange
the position of these two terms so I
have my x squared term first we'll have
4x squared since it's positive negative
32 x and positive 64 or plus 64 next we
want to set our equation equal to zero
so we subtract 16 x from both sides and
we add 16 to both sides we do this since
we know we'll get 0 on the left and this
polynomial on the right will have a
quadratic that we can try and factor all
of these terms have a common factor of
four so we can divide out our equation
by that factor will have 0 equals x
squared minus 12x plus 20 next we find
factors a positive 20 that's sum to
negative 12 these factors are negative
10 and negative 2 we set each factor
equal to 0 so X can equal 10 or X can
equal to and finally we check x equals
10 and x equals 2 and the original
equation when we do this we see that 10
does not check we get 12 equal to
negative 12 so this one is not going to
be part of our solution set however for
two it does check so this must be our
only solution so don't worry if you
stumbled at the beginning with squaring
this for if you're able to finish it out
great work</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
