is a routine that you can keep this way
for many many different applications all
it requires is a way to evaluate
something that depends on the parameters
and gives you a single error that you'd
like to minimize we have three
parameters in total I set the parameters
themselves to 0 but the deltas to one n
is just the counter it's unimportant if
the sum of D Pam's is still larger than
our tolerance which for initial F is
0.001 then go through all the parameters
sequentially I increment it by D params
find out what the error is if the error
is better than our best error which
initialized for the initial error then I
keep the best error and I even increment
D params otherwise I try the other
direction
run find out the error if that succeeds
I keep it I increment D prams and here's
my last case I didn't succeed so I'm
going to set it back to the old
parameter vector parameter vector and
decrease my DPMS by 0.9 I increase my
counter here's my little printout
command for debugging and I return the
parameter vector so let me comment out
the print vectors over here and play
with this a little more if I run twiddle
compute the best parameters and then
calculate the error using these
parameters and print other parameters
along with the error I get a parameter
vector and I get an error that's
basically zero now let's switch off the
integral term and I can do this with
little trick I just said the params
number two which is the final one two
zero point zero as if I already learnt
the integral term when I run this I get
a zero into the term by the error that's
somewhat larger than the final error
that I desired and that's because the
integral term is VD required to drive
the arrow down to zero let's also remove
the D term and see what happens and the
result is a really large error of 0.55
that large error sustains
even if I remove the robot drift by
commenting it out we still get an error
of 0.1 zero
you guys have a proportional controller
whereas if I add in the differential
prompt again by removing the D prime one
command the zero point one or three goes
down to
five point seven to the minus eleven
which is practically zero so you can see
the importance of the D term for driving
the arrow down to zero in the case
without drift and for the integral term
in cases for robots with a systemic bias
we play a little bit more with this code
for the homework assignment but this is
it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
