we were doing before which was you know
the sum of all these gammas times some R
max we can basically take out the R max
and what we end up with is something
that looks like that right you're
summing together a bunch of gammas and
then multiplying the result by R max so
what does that actually look like well
that looks like this gamma to the 0 plus
gamma to the 1 plus gamma squared plus
dot dot dot dot eventually multiplied by
R max right so let's call this X okay
just X include the R max or not no so
we'll just call the little sequence of
it's going to turn out not to matter but
let's just call the the sequence of
gammas that we're adding together let's
just call that X okay well if you look
at it this is actually recursive right
because it's an infinite sequence if you
sort of shifted it one over in time you
would end up with just the repeated
sequence again right which means that we
can write x in terms of itself
x equals gamma 0 plus gamma times X I
see so it's shifted over but then you
have to multiply it again by gamma to
get up to gamma 1 gamma 2 exactly so so
this is just you know it's just math
that's just all it is so we can try to
solve for X and figure out what X is
right cool
so what is X well we can subtract from
both sides and so we end up with like
something like X minus gamma x equals
gamma 0 right seems like we can stop
writing gamma 0 isn't it's just one yes
but I've gone too far Michael so this
becomes x times 1 minus gamma equals
gamma 0 or as Michael so astutely points
out 1 right
which means what it means then we divide
by 1 minus gamma X is 1 over 1 minus ya
and that's of course we're gonna
multiply by our max I get the formula
that we had that's
that's nifty there we go so why do we do
this well because you like stuff like
this and it points out something very
simple which is that geometry is easy I
don't think that's the kind of geometry
that people usually think of well they
should be thinking of this kind of
geometry so geometry is easy and by
doing little cute algebra we can derive
ridiculous equations that turn out to
help us deal with go an infinite
distance in finite time I don't think
that's what they're doing but okay so
let's think of this as warm-up for what
I actually wanted to show you which is
going to turn out to be a whole lot of
math okay all right let's go let's go
far let's do that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
