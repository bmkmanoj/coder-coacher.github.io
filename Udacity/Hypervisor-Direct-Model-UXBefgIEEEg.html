virtualization of physical devices is to
allow the hypervisor to first intercept
every single possible device access
that's performed by a guest via one of
the hypervisor has the information about
the device operation that the guest him
wanted to perform it doesn't have a
requirement that the device that the
guest VM wants and the physical device
match so the hypervisor would first
translate that device access to some
generic representation of an i/o
operation for that particular family of
devices whether their network devices or
disk devices and then it will traverse
the hypervisor resident the VM M
resident IO stack so the bottom of that
stack is the actual real device driver
and the hypervisor will invoke that
device driver and perform the i/o
operation on behalf of the guest VM
clearly a key benefit of this approach
is that now the virtual machine is again
decoupled from the physical device AMI
translation and emulation will be
performed by the hypervisor layer and
because of that operations such as
sharing and migration or the
requirements of how we need to deal with
device specifics all of that becomes
simpler in the sense this is a model
that's originally adapted by the VMware
ESX hypervisor the downside of the model
is that it clearly adds latency on
device accesses because of this
emulation step and then also it requires
that the device driver ecosystem is in
certain ways integrated with the
hypervisor now the hypervisor needs to
support all of the drivers so that it
can perform the necessary operations and
the hypervisor is then exposed to all of
the complexities of n bugs of various
device drivers again we said earlier in
the case of VMware because of its market
share this model was a reasonable model
and it made sense and it's been
sustained at both because of that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
