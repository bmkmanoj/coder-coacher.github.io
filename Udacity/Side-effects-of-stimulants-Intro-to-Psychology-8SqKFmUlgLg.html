your heart rate your blood pressure and
your respiration they can also decrease
your appetite now it's important to know
that this increase in heart rate is
really dangerous some people have
actually died the very first time
they've ever used a major stimulants
such as cocaine or methamphetamine
long-term consequence of using the major
stimulants such as cocaine and
methamphetamine also result in
formication and this is the feeling of
little bugs crawling under the person's
skin as a result people often pick and
scratch at their skin which results in
open wounds and increased likelihood for
infection another consequence is called
meth mouth and I recommend that you
google that and you can see some
unfortunate descriptions of what that is
finally long-term use of these major
stimulants in some people can result in
what is called stimulant induced
psychosis and here the individual thinks
and behaves somewhat similarly to
somebody with schizophrenia some of the
other long-term consequences of major
stimulant use are hyper vigilance sleep
deprivation anxiety and paranoia
long-term methamphetamine use can also
dramatically age you if you google faces
a meth you can see just how dramatically
meth can affect your parents when people
abuse the major stimulants they often go
on what is called a run meaning they'll
continuously take the drug and stay
awake for maybe two to three days at a
time now we know that our bodies simply
can't stay awake that long and
eventually the person will crash due to
the crash are going to experience
depression extreme fatigue and sometimes
even suicidal thoughts in addition
because the person starts to undergo
withdrawal they usually begin
drug-seeking behavior again now let's go
back and take a little review of the
major stimulants</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
