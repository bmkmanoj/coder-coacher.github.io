and as soon as I wrote it as I was
recording this video I set it running
and you know what it's still running it
hasn't completed yet
I gotta we met have done this before so
I have an idea of how long it's going to
take but we're in a race with it let's
see if before it completes we know it's
going to take on the order of an hour or
so can we write a program that's better
and faster and maybe even though that
programs got a head start we can catch
up with it and finish first now the
problem with this program is it goes
through all this work to try all the
five factorials to the fifth
combinations and then they get ruled out
really early and some of the
combinations it seems too silly that
we're bothering with them so if the
Englishman is not read we should know
that by the time we've got through the
second set of assignments here here
we've assigned read to some house and
English man to some house if we didn't
assign them to the same house why are we
bothering to go through all the
possibilities for the other properties
and so what we could do is move this
constraint up to the earliest time in
which both Englishman and read are
defined so there now I've moved it up
and now if Englishman is read is false
then we don't even have to bother to go
through all three of these loops so
we're going to eliminate a lot of work
in just that one clause now let's
consider another of the constraints
let's look at immediate right of green
and ivory
can we move that up and where can we
move it up to can we move immediate
right a green ivory up to here here here
or here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
