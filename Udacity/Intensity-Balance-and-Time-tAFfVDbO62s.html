work transfers and execution time
suppose the processor takes time units
to perform an operation thus the time to
perform just the compute operations is
tau times the work w next let alpha be
the amortized time to move one word of
data between slow and fast memory alpha
has units of time per word then the time
to execute Q transfers is alpha times L
times Q now let's assume perfect overlap
between data transfer and compute then
the minimum time to execute the program
would be the maximum of the time to
compute and the time to move the data
let's refactor this expression a little
this refactoring shows the execution
time relative to the ideal running time
which is just x w it's ideal in the
sense that it assumes data movement is
free now relative to this ideal
computation time you need to pay a
penalty this communication or transfer
penalty is the price you pay for having
to move the data now this penalty has
some structure let's start with the
denominator of this second argument why
it's nothing more than the algorithms
computational intensity recall that
intensity has units of operations per
word now what about the numerator the
numerator is the time per word divided
by the time per operation it's a ratio
of parameters that only depend on the
machine in the literature it's sometimes
referred to as the machines balance
point or just machine balance and just
like intensity it has units of
operations per word in other words this
ratio tells you how many operations can
be executing in the time that it takes
to move a word of data machine balance
is kind of a special parameter so let's
replace it with a symbol capital B
that's B as in buds okay so what we have
now is a general formula for the minimum
possible execution time in terms of the
balance of the machine and the intensity
of the algorithm for completeness we
could also estimate the maximum time for
computation in this model it's basically
the some rather than the max that's
because if there's no overlap you have
to pay for computation and communication
one after the other okay so we have a
formula to estimate the minimum
execution time sometimes rather than
asking about X
cution time we'll ask about a certain
measure of performance I'll denote that
measure by capital R its numerator is
tau times W star in other words the best
time in the pure RAM model so what is
dividing by T do y it gives you the
following formula it says the best
possible value of the normalized
performance is w star over W times the
min of one and intensity / balance this
measure of performance is inversely
proportional to time therefore higher
values are better take a moment to
ponder it as you'll explore it in more
depth momentarily</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
