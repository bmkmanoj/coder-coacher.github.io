multiplications to compute to to the 20
we only need five we're doing that by
taking advantage of the property that X
to the 2a is equal to X to the a squared
so that means if we're starting from 2
to the 20 well that's equal to 2 to the
10 squared now we can break to the 10
down into two to the five squared we can
break 2 to the five it's not divisible
by two so we need to break it down into
2 times 2 to the 4 and now we can break
2 to the 4 into 2 to the 2 squared and
now we can break 2 to the 2 into 2 times
2 so the number of multiplications we
need well each square is 1
multiplication and all of the other ones
so the number of multiplications we have
there's one for the two times two
there's one for the squaring that
there's one for multiplying that result
by two there's one for squaring that and
there's one for squaring that so we have
five total multiplications in order to
compute to to the 20 this property holds
in general this means we can compute a
two then using order of log n
multiplications the important thing to
point out here is that this is the value
of n not its size what this means is
that modular exponentiation scales
linearly in the size meaning the number
of bits we need to represent the power
this means we can make the power a very
large number and still compute a to that
power very quickly diffie-hellman takes
advantage of this property</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
