how virtualization actually helps us in
limiting the damage that can be caused
by a compromised or hacked operating
system we said maybe you want to run
more than one operating system on the
same underlying hardware but this is
going to help us with security as well
so limiting the damage of a hacked
operating system let's see how can we do
that when we have authorization okay the
way we do that is we change the picture
well you know we had the hardware and
the operating system well we introduce
something between the hardware and
operating system and that is called a
hypervisor on top of the hypervisor we
support what is called virtual machines
and these virtual machines have their
own operating system or the guest
operating system and the guest operating
system then can support a number of
applications that run within that
virtual machine so if we look at our
earlier picture we we have the hardware
then we have the hypervisor and then we
have this virtual machines so this is
the OS here and and the application here
compromise of an OS here only affects
these applications in this virtual
machine it doesn't do anything to the
applications that may be running in this
different virtual machine with the same
operating system or a different
operating system what we really have is
isolation between virtual machines so
earlier we had isolation between
processes or applications now and you
know they all shared the same operating
system now we have isolation between
different virtual machines each has its
own operating system a guest operating
system so I can do my taxes in one
virtual machine while browse potentially
in dangerous places on the web in a
different virtual machine anything bad
that happens in the second virtual
machine of vm two should not affect your
tax stuff that you doing on in your
first virtual machine so the trusted
computing ways really here is the
hypervisor the picture that we had
before where we had you know the
hardware and the trusted computing base
and then the application it changes with
virtualization where we have
hardware hypervisor and then the virtual
machines and those virtual machines have
their own operating system</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
