from New Jersey been living in Columbus
Ohio for the last two-and-a-half years
now when I was learning through Udacity
I was working full time as a mechanical
engineer at that point I was looking for
a way to change careers I ended up
taking the front-end web developer now
and a degree probably the biggest doubt
I had during the whole experience was
will I be able to get a job
I graduated from the nanodegree late
December after that I took maybe a week
or two to update my resume portfolio
LinkedIn and everything like that
started applying the jobs I wanted to
move back to either New York or Boston
and be closer to my family
I started getting responses back had
some interviews basically went through
their whole process same process anyone
else would go through end up getting an
on-site interview went through that went
really well I really liked the people I
met and then I heard back the next week
that I got the job but I think the
portfolio projects is really what got my
resume to stand out among the other ones
considering I didn't have a CS degree or
any work experience as a software
developer I think you know the problems
they gave me during the technical
interview I wouldn't have been able to
solve if I hadn't taken the courses from
Udacity if I hadn't gone through the
nanodegree I guess you'd a sities Way of
teaching I think just gives you a really
good basis for learning something else
or tackling a problem you haven't seen
before I think it definitely helped me
get the job
