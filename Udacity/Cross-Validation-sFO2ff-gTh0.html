this concept of cross-validation so so
imagine that we've got our data which is
our training set we can again picture it
geometrically in the case of regression
and ultimately what we're trying to do
is find a way of predicting values in
the testing set so what were what we
imagine is we do some kind of regression
and we might want to fit this to a line
and you know the line is good it kind of
captures what's going on and then if we
apply this to the testing set maybe that
it's going to it's going to do a pretty
good job but if we are you know feeling
kind of obsessive-compulsive about it we
might say well in this particular case
we didn't actually track all the ups and
downs of the data so what could we do in
terms of if we if we fit it with a line
and that the error is not so great what
else could we switch to Charles we could
just use the test set no sorry what I
mean is if we fit we fit this to a line
and we're sort of not happy with the
fact that the line isn't fitting all the
points exactly we might want to use a
maybe a higher order polynomial oh I'm
sorry I told them as one field is better
so if we can fit this with a higher
order polynomial and it maybe it'll hit
all these points much better you know so
we have this kind of kind of other shape
and now it's doing this it's making
weird predictions in certain places so
really what we'd like to do is what was
your suggestion if we trained on the
test set we would do much better on the
test set yes but that that that's
definitely cheating why is it cheating
is there some why is it cheating well if
we exactly fit the air the the test set
that's not a function at all is it we
exactly fit that the the test set then
again that's not going to generalize to
how we use it in the real world ah so
the goal is always to generalize the
test set is just a stand-in for what we
don't know we're going to see in the
future yes very well said thank you
actually that suggests something very
important right it suggests that nothing
we do on our training set or even if we
cheat and use the test set actually
makes sense
unless we believe that somehow the
training set and the test set represent
the future yes that's a very good point
that that we are assuming that this data
is representative of how the system is
ultimately going to be used in fact
there's a abbreviation that
statisticians like to use that the data
we really count on the data being
independent and identically distributed
which is to say that all the data that
we've collected it's all really coming
from the same source and so there's no
sort of weirdness that the training set
looks different for the testing set
looks different from the world but
they're all drawn from the same
distribution so would you call that a
fundamental assumption of supervised
learning I don't know that I'd call it a
fundamental assumption of supervised
learning per se but it's a fundamental
assumption in a lot of the algorithms
that we run that's for sure there's
definitely people who have looked at
well what happens in real data if these
assumptions are violated are there
algorithms that we can apply that still
do reasonable things but the stuff that
we're talking about yes this is
absolutely a fundamental assumption all
right but here's here's where I'm trying
to get with this stuff so what we really
would like to do is that we'd like to
use a model that's complex enough to
actually model the structure that's in
the data that we're training on but not
so complex that it's it's matching that
so directly that it doesn't really work
well on the test set but unfortunately
we don't really have the test set to
play with because that again is going to
is too much teaching to the test we need
to actually learn the true structure
that is going to need to be generalized
so so how do we find out how can we how
can we pick a model that is complex
enough to model the data while making
sure that it hasn't started to kind of
diverge in terms of how it's going to be
applied to the test set if we don't have
access to the test set is there
something that we can use in the
training set that we could have it kind
of act like a test set well we could
take some of the training data and
pretend it's a test set and that
wouldn't be cheating because it's not
really the test set
excellent indeed right so there's
nothing magic about the training set all
needing to be used to fit the
coefficients it could be that we hold
out some of it
as a kind of make pretend test set etre
a test test set a trial test set a what
we're going to say cross-validation set
and it's going to be a stand-in for the
actual test data that we can actually
make use of that doesn't involve
actually using the test data directly
which is ultimately going to be cheating
so this cross-validation set is going to
be really helpful in figuring out what
to do so alright so here's how we're
going to do this this concept of
cross-validation we're going to take our
training data and we're going to split
it into what are called folds I'm not
actually sure why they're called folds I
don't know if that's a sheep reference
why would it be the sheep reference I
think there's a sheep related concept
that is called a fold like you know
we're going to bring you back into the
fold
oh it's like the it's like the group of
sheep you are just chock-full of
knowledge all right so what we're going
to do is train on the first three folds
and use the fourth one to see how we did
train on the second third and fourth
fold and check on the first one and
we're going to we're going to try all
these different combinations leaving out
each fold as a kind of a fake test set
and then average all these errors the
the goodness of fit averaged them all
together to see how well we've done and
the model class so like the degree of
the polynomial in this case that does
the best job the lowest error is the one
that we're going to go with all right so
if this is a little bit abstract still
let me let me ground this it back out in
the housing example</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
