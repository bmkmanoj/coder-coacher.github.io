software development which is software
design software design is the phase
where software requirements are analyzed
in order to produce a description of the
internal structure and organization of
the system and this description will
serve as the basis for the construction
of the actual system traditionally the
software design phase consists of a
series of design activities which
normally consist of the architectural
design phase the abstract specification
interface design component design data
structure and algorithm design and
notice that this is just a possible list
of activities but you can also
characterize design activities in many
different ways and if you look at
different books and different sources
you might find different activities
described but the core idea the
important point is there we go from a
sort of an high level view of the system
which is the architectural design to a
low level view which is the algorithm
design and this activities result in a
set of design products which describe
various characteristics of the system
for example they describe the
architecture of the system so how the
system is decomposed and organized into
components the interfaces between these
components they also describe these
components into a level of details that
is suitable for allowing their
construction we will discuss the details
of software design and talk extensively
about these different activities and
these different products in the third
mini course of this class</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
