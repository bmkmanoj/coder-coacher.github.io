memorization but I've heard in the real
world many tools use techniques such as
lalr 1
why didn't we learn those that is a good
question then actually there are a
number of answers to it all the numerate
maybe five of them one of the first is
that this memoization or chart parsing
technique that we learned is actually
very similar to almost isomorphic to
some of the more advanced techniques
used in practice you can read up on or
you may have heard of GL our generalized
LR parsing that's commonly used in tools
such as blink the real name for a
software project go check it out
which can be used to parse complicated
languages like C++ it turns out that C++
is grammar doesn't really easily fit
into these restrictive little cubby
holes that some of the faster tools
prefer it can really be a contortion
that distorts meaning to try to get C++
to fit into one of these other tools by
teaching you a very general technique
early on that can handle any
context-free grammar you know how
parsing works even in these obscure
corner cases and I'm teaching you the
approach that's used in the more
advanced tools another reason related to
this is that all of these tools have the
same interface if you want to go try out
later on it accepts the same sort of
context-free grammar format that we're
used to
so does yak so does bison so does Oh
camel yak so does Java cups sodas re-ack
Ruby yak I've taught you the way to
phrase it
and then the particular tool under the
hood can use whatever parsing algorithm
it prefers in the same way that we write
regular expressions a B plus and then
depending on whether we're writing a
Perl program or a Python program or some
other program it might convert that
regular expression to a finite state
machine slightly differently but we know
what the final output is going to be we
know what strings are going to be
matched similarly here when you write
your grammar regardless of what parts
were generating algorithm is eventually
used we know what the behavior is
going to be that's what we've covered in
this class and there's a related
argument you might say well you know why
are we using Python in this class when
the real world uses C or Java or C++ or
whichever language you think is commonly
used in the real world perhaps c-sharp
that's the same argument here why are we
using this chart parsing when the real
world uses these slightly different
tools and this is a big question in
education and pedagogy I honestly
believe as a practitioner and a
researcher that there's a key difference
between knowing how to program and
knowing how to program in a particular
language and the former is much more
important if you know how to program in
Java if you've survived this class you
can pick up another language like Ruby
Java Python do the same thing knowing
how to program thinking about recursion
thinking about laying laying out data
thinking about algorithms that's much
more important than knowing the
particular syntax for any language
similarly here I believe that really
understanding context-free grammars and
parsing is more important than knowing
which particular parser generator tool
implementation is being used under the
hood you know one particular algorithm
for creating parsers and that may as
well be the one that's used in practice
another reason that I focused on this
algorithm is that it is simple it
relates grammars to parsing which is one
of the concepts in this class we lay out
context-free grammars but now we need to
be able to tell if a string and
utterances in the language of that
grammar and build up its parse tree it's
only a few lines long and it allows us
to introduce lovely concepts like
memoization or list comprehensions a
number of you might wonder if we were to
write our parser in another way maybe
you've heard of techniques like
recursive descent or using lalr 1
grammars would it be just as convenient
I have done them all and the answer is
no by no means is a recursive descent
parser or an lalr 1 grammar for the
language fragment that we're considering
here as easy as the parsing algorithm
that I showed you now this is in fact
the most elegant approach and then
finally
number of students were concerned about
the time taken by our parser which is
cubic or runs in time proportional to
the size times the size times the size
of the input program in the worst case
for an ambiguous grammar now this is a
bit beyond the scope of this course but
it's worth pointing out that these other
tools that claim to be faster it's not
actually a fair comparison the parsing
algorithm I taught you handles any
grammar the tools that feint claim to be
faster
don't they only handle special
restricted grammars an interesting note
that I didn't cover in this course but
that's nonetheless true is that the
particular parsing algorithm that we
covered also runs in linear time is very
fast for the same small class of
grammars lrk grammars they're called
that are accepted by these faster tools
so if you were the sort of person who
would take all the work and time
required to shoehorn your languages
description into the particular
straitjacket format favored by these
other faster tools the faster tools are
actually just as slow or just as fast to
your choice as the algorithm I taught
you in the limit they're asymptotic
complexity is the same they're both
linear time so you don't lose anything
in terms of time either again getting
back to the first point I think it's
more of a historical accident that most
of these tools happen to use lalr 1 or
other hacks for speed and practice and
in the last few years last 10 years say
research is focused increasingly on G LR
parsing or the sort of chart parsing
that I've shown you as a way of allowing
people to write people to write the
grammars that they want get linear time
super fast performance most of the time
pay a little bit when things are
ambiguous and then get on with their
lives and I foresee that languages like
C++ or Java or whatnot more complicated
languages will be analyzed using tools
like that in the future so it's my
honest belief as an educator that I'm
teaching you the right approach teaching
you something like lalr 1 now that
information is really not necessary in
the modern world and it's long those
lectures feel like they go on forever by
contrast this chart based approach is
elegant simple allows us to introduce
fun context handles all grammars which
the other approaches do not fits in just
a few slides and is just as fast in the
limit what's not to like</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
