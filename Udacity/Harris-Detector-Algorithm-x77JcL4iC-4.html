approach again in in same steps but
different details compute the Gaussian
derivatives at each pixel for each and
every image that's what we want to do
second thing we want to do is compute
the second moment matrix in a Gaussian
window around each pixel again find a
pixel and going through the whole image
find a small region and compute the
second moment matrix because now we have
the derivatives we know how to do this
and again we want to compute this within
a window then using that remember how we
can actually take our color compute our
from em by looking at its trace and its
determinant we can compute R we want to
do a little bit of thresholding and R
because we don't want to just completely
live off the the details which we had
remember we showed you that with the
example image to the bright white spots
we convert into small white dots which
were hard to see
then finally find a local Maxima of the
response function by using a non maximum
suppression and that basically now
starts giving us features now they have
found features in two images which mean
now can be using to match between those
two images</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
