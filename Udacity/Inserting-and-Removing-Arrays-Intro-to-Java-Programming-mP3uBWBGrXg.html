element here is my partially filled
array and I want to insert an element
before this position so I need to move
all of these elements out of the way so
that the green element can go into this
slot now you have to be a bit careful
with the move out of the way part if I
were to move this element over here and
then this element over here and so on
that would be bad because then this
element would override the next one
before I had a chance to move that one
out of the way so in other words this
element would flood the entire tail of
the array the remedy is to do the
movement starting at the end of the
array so I first moved this one then its
predecessor then its predecessor and I
keep going until I've moved the one into
whose slot I want to put the new one the
other thing to remember is that
insertion increases the size so I have
to make sure to add one to the size of
my partially filled array let's look at
this in Java code I increase the size
here is the loop to make room for the
new element so when I increase my size
then I'm starting at size minus one
which is the same as the old size I now
go backwards and each of the moves goes
the other direction than the one that
you've seen with removal it goes from
the lower index to a higher index and
the last movement is the one that moves
pause to pause plus one so we want this
one to be pause which means we want I to
be pause plus one and that's where we
stop finally when we're all done we can
insert the new value at the position
pause as you've seen inserting and
removing array elements requires quite a
bit movement you need to move elements
out of the way in the case of insertion
or move them to close up the gap in the
situation of removal it was all so easy
with array lists where you just called
add and remove but the reason that I've
explained to you what actually goes on
with arrays is an ArrayList has a
partially filled array inside it and
it's sometimes important to know which
operations are cheap and which ones are
expensive inserting and removing can be
expensive for a long array</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
