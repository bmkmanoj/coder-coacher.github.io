first what we do is we take the month
string from the user if it's there you
know if it's a non empty string I
capitalized it because the list I
include before of all of the months has
the days capitalized and if that
capitalized month is in that list return
that value so let's let's try a couple
versions of this valid month January and
we run this we see it prints January
let's try July I run this and it prints
July and everything's formatted nicely
and and all as well okay now let's try
entering some some junk in here okay we
run this and that returns nothing and
what happens if I enter in nothing we
get nothing okay
so this seems to be working now what if
we wanted to make this a little bit more
user-friendly so the user doesn't have
to type in a complete month and spell it
correctly here's the change I would
probably make so at the top of this file
we have a list of a list of months you
know what what I'm going to do is I'm
going to build a dictionary I'm a
mapping of just the first three letters
of the month name to the month name
itself so we're only going to match on
the first three letters of what the user
enters okay so I've added this
dictionary and for M in months which is
our list from above of the month names
we're gonna make a mapping of the first
three letters of that month that's what
this M colon 3 is lowercase using the
lower function to the month name itself
and if I were to print that out it looks
like this down here and they are to
March Feb 2 February August dog you get
that you get the point
now this isn't in any particular order
because in Python dictionaries aren't
ordered now let's update the main
function here to use system dictionary
ok so now I've made the changes we still
say if month and now I'm making a new
variable called short month which just
equals the first three letters of
whatever the user typed in lowercased so
first three letters lowercase and then I
use the get function on a Python
dictionary to see if our if those first
three letters the user typed in is in
that mapping and if it is we return the
value from that mapping which in this
that's what the get function does it
says if if our key is in the mapping
return the value otherwise return none
and so we're going to return either that
value or none let's try this out
together
so print valid months okay so I run this
function on January like we did before
and it prints out January with a capital
J that's the baby ur head before let's
try something a little bit different
what if I type in just Feb if I run this
we get February with a capital F so now
our date form or a date field in our
form will be able to accept a wider
variety of things and if you're like me
and you can never spell February
correctly
you know I'll misspell this and I and I
hit run we still get February nicely and
so this is nice so I can type in any
sorts of junk and if the first few
letters match a month you know we can
assume that the user was probably on the
right track okay
see December</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
