of the class I hope everyone's enjoyed
it and learned a lot about cryptography
I'll summarize the class briefly and
then I will talk about one new protocol
and one new application of cryptography
to do secure computation one important
point that I want to make today that I
haven't made throughout the class enough
is that cryptography is very different
from security when we're thinking about
cryptography these are very abstract
things we're thinking about whether we
can use math to solve problems on the
other hand security depends on a lot
more than just cryptography security is
really mostly about people no matter how
good your math is if someone picks
123456 for their password it doesn't
matter you're not going to have security
security is also about systems and how
they interface with each other many of
the security problems are because of
misunderstanding the connections between
systems in this class we've largely
focused on cryptography and not address
the broader issues about security but if
you want to build secure systems well
these issues are very important it's not
just about the math cryptography is all
about secrets and we've seen lots and
lots of ways to use secrets to solve
problems we started in unit 1 looking at
the one-time pad where we could X or a
message with a key and we saw that that
provides perfect secrecy and a strong
theoretical sense that an eavesdropper
who intercept this message can learn
nothing at all about the message but
that it requires a perfectly random key
that's never reused that's as long as
the message so it doesn't work well in
practice it also has all sorts of other
problems like the malleability of the
one-time pad this led us in unit 2 to
look at some ways to use practical
symmetric ciphers to provide nothing
close to perfect secrecy but something
useful for many purposes we saw that we
can amplify the security provided by a
small shared key to obtain a secure
channel for sending long messages and we
talked about modes of operation that can
do that with different levels of
security and then we talked about
cryptographic hash functions which
provide a way to map a message to a
smaller value that provides preimage
resistance so it's hard to find a
message that hashes that Val
as well as collision resistance and this
is usual for authentication as well as
lots of other purposes that we've seen
the big limitation of symmetric ciphers
is they require a shared secret between
the two parties in unit 3 we talked
about key distribution focusing on the
diffie-hellman protocol for key
agreement and that allows two parties to
establish a shared secret starting from
an insecure Channel that led to
asymmetric cryptosystems in particular
RSA as an example of a public key
cryptosystem that provide the additional
functionality where that encryption
function doesn't reveal the decryption
function this enables lots of
interesting uses of cryptography in unit
5 we saw how to use public key combined
with symmetric ciphers to provide
authentication and we focused in
particular on the TLS protocol that's
used as the basis for electronic
commerce on the web in unit 6 we looked
at protocols for anonymous routing
voting and digital cash all of which
combined a mix of asymmetric and
symmetric crypto systems so I hope
you've enjoyed this tour of cryptography
we've seen lots of different things that
can be built from a few simple
primitives I'm going to cover one more
protocol this unit which is looking at
secure computation and it uses many of
the tools that we've seen in all of
these previous units</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
