tracing through Turing machine
computations and programming Turing
machines the point of these exercises is
not so that you can put on your resume
that you're good at programming Turing
machines and if someone asks you in an
interview to write a program to test say
whether an input number is prime I
wouldn't recommend trying to draw a
Turing machine state diagram somehow I
doubt that will land you the job rather
the point is to help you convince
yourself that Turing machines can do
everything that we mean by computation
and if you really had to you could
program a Turing machine to do anything
you could write a procedure to do in
your favorite programming language there
are two ways to convince yourself of
this one is to just practice so that you
build up enough of a facility with
programming Turing machines that is to
say it just becomes easy enough for you
so that it seems intuitive that you
could do anything another way to
convince yourself of the power of Turing
machines is to show that a Turing
machine can simulate the action of
models that are closer to real world
computers like the random access model
will do that in a later lesson but to be
able to understand these simulation
arguments you need a pretty good
facility with how Turing machines work
anyway so make the most of these
examples and exercises</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
