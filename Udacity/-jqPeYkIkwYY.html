like much you've gotten quite far
already you learn how to connect user
interface element to the code with ib
actions and use ib outlets to change the
state of UI elements from the code
within your view controller you've also
taken your first steps into auto layout
and of course in developing for iOS
using Swift let's take a moment and
discuss with these UI labels and your
eye buttons come from developing for iOS
app I wanted to make it easier for us to
create interactive elements to that end
much as it is on the Mac they've
developed a series of frameworks that we
can use in building our iOS app the main
framework you're going to be using in
this iOS development is called UI kit
any classes to start with you I are from
the UI kit framework and these include
UI label uibutton UI view and even
uiviewcontroller we've not talked about
UI view controller as much yet we're
going to go into much more detail in the
next lesson there will provide a logic
behind the view and what connects it to
the model which has all the data sound
familiar yep it's the
model-view-controller pattern we
discussed earlier there are many many
classes inside the UI kit framework
ranging from labels to buttons all the
way to table views in addition to UI kit
there are many other powerful frameworks
in iOS from audio to rendering to web
services to even gathering data from the
GPS gyroscope and accelerometer we're
going to cover quite a lot of them in
this course and give you a solid
understanding and practice in iOS
development in the next lesson we're
going to take pitch perfect and add
multiple views we're going to set the
groundwork so it can record audio</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
