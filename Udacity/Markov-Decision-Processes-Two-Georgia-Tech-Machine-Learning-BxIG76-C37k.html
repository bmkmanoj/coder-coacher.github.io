what's called the model or the
transition model sometimes people refer
to it as a transition function and
basically it is a function of three
variables it's a state an action which I
haven't defined for you yet and another
state in fact since I haven't defined
what an action is where you have let's
skip that and actually do define actions
for you so the third part of our model
our actions actions are the things that
you can do in a particular state so what
would the actions be in this world well
the four different decisions I could
make were the up down left and right
though it's maybe a little confusing
because I think those were also the four
possible outcomes that's true well no
there are other outcomes you could stay
where you were
right right so these are actually the
actions these are the things that when
I'm in a given state I'm allowed to
execute I can either go up go down go
left or go right you'll notice that as I
described before there was no option not
to move hmm but there could have been
and there could have been other actions
like teleport or there's anything that
you can imagine but the point is that
your action set represents all of the
things that the agent the robot the
person or whatever it is you're trying
to model is allowed to do now in its
full generalized form we tend to think
of the set of actions that one can take
as being a function of state because
there's some states you can do some
things and some states you can't do
those things but most of the time people
just treat it as a set of actions and
the actions that aren't allowable in
particular States simply have no effect
alright so we understand States they're
the things that describe the world we
understand actions those are the things
that you can do the commands you can
execute when you're in particular States
and what a model describes what the
transition model describes is in some
sense the rules of the game that you're
playing it's the physics of the world so
it's a function of three of three
variables a state an action and another
state which by the way could actually be
the same state and what this function
produces is the probability that you
will end up transitioning to state s
prime given that you were in state s and
you took action a got it I think so so
the s prime is where you end up and the
si is what you're given so it's so you
plug these three in oh I see and you get
a probably
but the probabilities have to add up to
one if you if you sum it up over all the
S Prime's right that's exactly right so
for example if you think about the
deterministic case where there was no
noise then this is a very simple model
if I'm in the state the start state and
I take the action up then what's the
probability I end up in the state
immediately above it was at a point
eight no in the when we first started in
the deterministic world oh that was
probability one right and what would be
the probability you ended up in the
state to the right probability zero
right in fact the probability that you
end up in any of the other states is
zero in the terminus t'k world now what
about the case when we were in the non
deterministic world where an action
would actually execute faithfully only
80 percent of the time if I'm in the
start state and I go up what's the
probability that I end up in the state
above that was pointing right what's the
probability I end up in the state to the
right that was point one and was the
probability I end up where I started
that was also playing right and zero
everywhere else and that's just sort of
the way that it works so the model
really is an important thing and the
reason it's important is it really does
describe the rules of the game it tells
you what you what will happen if you do
something in a particular place it
captures everything that you know about
the transition of the world what you
know about the rules got it
did you call it physics before I called
it the physics of the world huh these
are the rules that don't change but
they're very different from real-world
physics well yeah
although they don't have to be I mean in
some sense you could argue that a Markov
decision process what we've described so
far these three things in fact do
describe the universe the states are you
know the positions of all the atoms the
positions and velocities of all the
atoms in the universe the transition
models as you do take certain actions in
the world whatever they are how the
state of the universe changes in
response to that and the actions or
whatever those set of actions can be and
it can be probabilistic or it's not
probably indefinitely probabilistic
transition models are by their very
definition probabilistic gotcha</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
