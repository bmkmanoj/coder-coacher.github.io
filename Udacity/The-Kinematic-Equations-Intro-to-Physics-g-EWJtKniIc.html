the course Delta x equals V naught T
plus 1/2 a t-square
now I've introduced this Delta because
this equation really describes how much
an object position changes from here to
there over a period of time given an
initial velocity and an acceleration I
wrote a here instead of G because well a
is more general and in physics we like
general equations this is the
acceleration of your object which on
earth in freefall does happen to be this
number G which is 10 meters per second
squared
on the moon though this number is
actually significantly smaller so this
is one of the important kinematic
equations it's one of the equations that
really describes how objects move now
there's a couple other kinematic
equations that I want to talk about and
I'm actually gonna do something that I'm
a little reluctant to do I'm gonna give
them to you the next one I want to talk
about is this one velocity equals
initial velocity plus acceleration times
the amount of time the object's been
moving okay fine well am I reluctant to
give this to you I'm reluctant because I
already did when we defined acceleration
we defined it as a change in velocity
over some elapsed time some change in
time in fact that's exactly what this
equation says though it's hidden a bit
this velocity is actually what we can
call some final velocity after some time
has elapsed so if we just rearrange us a
little bit like this and then we can
even divide by T if we'd like we have
the definition of acceleration it's the
change in velocity final minus initial
over the elapsed time T the last
equation I want to talk about is this
one and what does this one say it's is
that there's some relationship between
final velocity initial velocity
acceleration and distance traveled
driving this one is a bit trickier but
still something that I think you can do
I'm not gonna do the derivation here but
I'd love to see some discussion about
this in the forums now let me say this
is often the place where students get a
bit scared I've had many students tell
me that equations are frightening but
the fact is they aren't there are Nana
Mae objects but they're not even objects
they're an inanimate idea and in fact
they're a tool they're a tool for us and
when you see a tool that you don't know
how to use you have two choices for how
to respond you can walk away discouraged
because hey you don't know what to do
with it or you can
and all the amazing things this tool
will let you do sit down
and learn to use it I hope that's the
option you choose let's sit down and
learn how to use these tools</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
