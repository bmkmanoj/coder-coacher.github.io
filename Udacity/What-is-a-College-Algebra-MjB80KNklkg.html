half of the screen this equation in
orange right here is completely related
to everything over here on the left we
know that instead of writing total money
earned we can write a like we have in
this bottom equation so can cross this
out input a and as we figured out
alternate expressions for money earned
from wipers and money earned from
nozzles we can just substitute in those
new values in these slots so we know
that money from wipers is also seen over
here and it equals 36 w so you can take
36 w here and put it here we can do the
same thing with the money from the
nozzles money from nozzles is 22 n so we
can put that in the spot of course we
want to keep the operators that join
these quantities together since we're
just calling these quantities different
names so we still have an equal sign and
a plus sign so we should have a equals
36 w move the plus sign down plus 22 n
so our answer choice must be well here
is that exact thing written down 36 w
plus 22 n the question is are any of
these other answers right well we can go
through one by one and eliminate ones we
know are wrong this has a bunch of
factors multiplied together so does this
one this one has four different terms
added together and that's not we're
looking for since we only have two terms
up here and all of the rest are at least
almost in the form that we're looking
for 2w has never popped up anywhere for
us before this I mean that 36 people are
each paying grant 2w dollars we know
that in order to buy a set of wipers
from Grant you only pay w dollars and
that 36 people bought wipers so this
answer is not correct we need something
with just 36 w in it if we look at the
remaining answers there are some
incorrect combinations of coefficients
and variables you know that 36 goes with
W not with n so this answer can't be
right or this one and we know that the
coefficient of n needs to be 22 since as
we figured out a couple of quizzes go 11
times 2n equals 22 n we want each the 11
people who are purchasing nozzles to buy
too so this answer isn't right either so
now we're left with just two answers 36w
plus 2n which we know is right and 22 n
plus 36 w now this expression is
actually exactly equivalent to this one
so it's right as well
in order to say that this is true we
have to use something called the
commutative property of addition this is
really similar to the commutative
property of multiplication that we've
talked about a lot already except that
this time instead of talking about
switching order when you multiply things
we're talking about changing order when
you add things together so just like we
know that two plus three equals five we
also know that three plus two equals
five that means we know that two plus
three is equal to three plus two in the
same way if you have not just numbers
but numbers and variables let's say an
expression like 36 w plus 2n you can
rearrange the order of the terms that
are added together and get an equivalent
expression like 22 n plus 36 w so that
means that both of these answer choices
were correct</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
