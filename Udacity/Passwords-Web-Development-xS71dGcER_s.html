and this is the basic HTML file we were
editing before and that we're opening in
our browser we're going to go back to
this a little bit so we can learn some
new form elements okay so the first
thing I'm going to do is remove the
action parameter from the form element
so that we can submit the form to itself
and we'll see the Q parameter in the URL
again and this makes it easy to
demonstrate what's going on without
having to go back to our app server and
all that stuff okay so I remove that
let's go to our browser and let's give
this form a test all right so I reload
the page I type in some junk here which
should a autocompletes for me I click
Submit and we see some junk in the URL Q
equals some junk okay let's go back to
our editor okay so here we are in our
editor one thing that then leaving off
is the type parameter on this first
input so let's go ahead and add that
type equals text type equals text is the
default type of an input parameter I
didn't include it originally because I
didn't want to spend a whole lot of time
talking about that at the time but in
reality we want to be a little bit more
specific with our types especially now
that we're going to learn some new types
so if I change that to type text the
behavior won't change in the browser and
the first thing we're going to do is
learn a new type so instead of being
text we're going to change this to
password the password type is useful for
entering passwords in the text box okay
so here we are in our browser now when
we type some some text into the box here
it appears has dots instead of the
actual text so for the next quiz what
I'd like you to do is tell me what
happens when I click the submit button
you can try this out on your own at home</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
