cases in which a page that we are
faulting on is private to a process so
let's consider the case where a page is
actively shared that means there are two
hosts P and Q and both of them are
actively sharing a page X and currently
some process on host Q is using that
page X odors in the local part in the
working set portion of host q on host p
the processes page faulting on the same
page x so when it page faults GMS says
oh let me find out where it is well it
finds that x is in the local part of
host q and because it is in the current
working set of hosts q we want to leave
it there we don't want to yank it away
from there we want to leave it there we
want to make a copy of this page into
the local part of host p so that the
faulting process on host p will have
access to the page x again we have the
same situation that the working set on
host p is increasing the local part has
to allocate one more page in physical
memory for the active working set for
the processes on p so the global part
has to shrink by one so this goes up by
one this goes down by one pic again some
arbitrary page from the global part it
doesn't have to be the LRU page because
all that we're going to do is we're
going to put this into the pier memory
somewhere so in that sense what we're
doing is we're going to say well take
this Y and host it in some of the pier
cash so what do we who are we going to
send it to well we're going to send it
to the hosts are that happens to have
the globally oldest page remember that
in this situation the total memory
pressure of the entire cluster is going
up by one not just this guy because X is
going to be still present in the working
set of hosts q + X is also going to be
present in the working set of host p
which means the total memory pressure
entire cluster is going up by one and if
that is the case then I have to
necessarily pick a page from the entire
cluster
and throw it all under the desk and
that's what we're doing here what we are
saying is that hosts are happens to have
the globally oldest page and this page
that I'm replacing from host p in order
to accommodate the missing page and
bring it into my local cache on host p
is to throw out why over to host our and
hosts are in order to make room for this
guy in its global cache has to
necessarily pick a victim from its
physical memory and the victim apics is
going to be the LRU candidate and that
could come from the local part all from
the global part again if it comes from
the global part we know it's private we
can throw it away if it comes from the
local part it could be that this is a
dirty copy in which case we have to
write it over to the disk or drop it on
the floor if it is a clean copy because
the disk always has all the copies of
the pages in either case the important
message is that if the LRU candidate
that we're going to throw out onto the
disk a drop on the floor comes from the
local part of our that means similar to
the previous case the working set on
local r is shrinking it's coming down by
one which means host our can do more
community service in the future and now
x is present in the working set of both
host q and host p which means actively
some process on host p some process on
host q are accessing this page x i
mentioned earlier that this is not
something that gsm worries about if
coherence has to be maintained for the
copies of the same page existing on
multiple nodes that's not in the domain
of GSM because gsm is simply a paging
device so it doesn't worry about
coherence maintenance that has to be
something that the application or some
higher level of the software has to
worry about so we can talk about the
relative split between local and global
in this particular case well in this
case host p local goes up by one global
goes down by
and host q nothing changes because this
is an actively shared page which means
we leave the copy here just give a copy
over to pee so the balance between local
and global doesn't change on the other
hand and hosts are if the replacement
candidate came out of the global part
then there is no change in the split
between local and global on host are
either on the other hand if the
replacement candidate came from the
local cache of hosts are what that means
is that the working set memory pressure
on host are is decreasing and therefore
L will go down by 1 and G will go up by
one I want you to think through all
these four cases very carefully the
first three cases that we looked at
where cases in which the pages were all
private and this is the only case where
the page is potentially shared because
it is in the hole it is in the local
cache of host Q and in the local cache
of host p as well so now it is time for
a quiz</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
