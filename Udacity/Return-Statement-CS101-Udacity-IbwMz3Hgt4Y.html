outputs the procedure almost writes
itself especially since we already know
the code that we wanted to execute
before we define the procedure so i'm
going to write the procedure by
modifying the code here so first what
we're going to do is make a little space
erasing the code that's not part of the
four lines that we want to turn in the
procedure so now I've I haven't modified
the code at all what I have is almost
exactly what I need for the body of the
procedure this is what we want to do
what we need to do is modify that to get
in the inputs and turn it into a
procedure so to make it a procedure we
need to use the Deaf name syntax so
we're going to define the procedure get
next target we need our input and we
said well we decided what the input
should be so now we need our parameters
the parameters are the inputs to the
procedure and we decided what the input
should be is the web contents that's a
string giving the contents of the web
page and that's what we had in the
variable page so we can call that page
again here that's what we're passing in
is our input and now we have the body of
the procedure the code is exactly the
same as the code we have before but this
time instead of page being whatever it
was here pages whatever we pass in as
the input of the procedure and we can
change the name of page it sort of makes
sense to change that name this code
works no matter what we pass in doesn't
have to be a web page any string that we
pass in this code will find it so it
makes more sense to give it a slightly
more generic name will change the name
to s if we change the name of the
parameter well everywhere that we use
page now we don't have the value of page
what we have is the value of s which is
the name of the parameter so we'll
change all of those two S's as well so
we're almost done there's one big thing
we have left to do and that's how do we
get the outputs right we said what we
want the outputs to be is the URL and
the value of n quotient we need some way
of getting those back and the way to you
do that is to use return returns a
special construct in Python so we have
the keyword return followed by a list of
all the things that we want to return
the procedure so what we return is a
list of any number of expressions
separated by commas we can have zero
return expressions that would mean
there's no output and it actually is
useful to have procedures with no output
sometimes that's not true if we just
think of procedures as things that map
inputs to outputs but procedures can
also do other things they can do what we
call side effects and what side effects
are things that we can see but that
aren't the outputs and an example of a
side effect would be well if we printed
something out we would see that result
happen we see everything that happens
when the code and procedure runs but we
wouldn't get it as an output so in this
case we do want to have outputs from get
next target we want to return results so
we know how to continue and we decided
what the output should be are the value
of the URL so we want to find the string
that's the next target and the value of
the end quote so we know the position
where it was found so let's see if you
can figure out how to finish the return
statement and your goal is to figure out
the code that we need after the return
to finish this procedure</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
