decision variant of vertex cover so what
about the optimization problem actually
that's not that difficult we just run
through all values of K so we will first
start out assuming K equals 1 then our
algorithm requires oh of 2.4 to the
power of 1 times n cubed time then will
increase K 22 algorithm requires 2.4 to
the power of 2 times n cubed time so
each time we're solving the decision
problem here let me increase K even
further to K equals 3 and so on and so
on and so on until we had we hit some
value K prime which is the size of the
smallest vertex cover of the input graph
of course we don't know what that size
will be in advance but once we have
increased k enough solving the decision
variant will give us the answer yes now
how much running time is this in total
well you need to know a bit of discrete
mathematics for this but the running
time overall is 2.4 to the power of 1
plus 2.4 to the power of 2 and so on
until you hit 2.4 to the power of k
prime times n cubed now if you have
added discrete math course and remember
what you learned there you will
recognize this part here as a geometric
series and this evaluates to 2.4 to the
power of k prime minus one minus one
over 2.4 minus 1 which is the same as 0
of 2.4 to the power of K Prime and K
prime is the size of the smallest vertex
cover times n cubed now we forgot the
end cube here I'll just put it here and
this is amazing because now it means
that not only the decision variant of
vertex cover can be solved in 2.4 to the
power of K times n to the power of 3
time but it means that the optimization
variant of vertex cover can also be
solved in oh of 2.4 to the power of K
times n cube time where K is the minimum
size of a vertex cover for the input
graph and this again emphasizes the fact
small vertex covers are easy to find
even if we don't know that a graph has a
small vertex cover as long as it is
small it will be easy to find and for
any fixed K so either in the decision
variant we fix k or we say we look at
all graphs that say have a vertex cover
of size 10 or 20 or 30 we can solve this
NP complete problem in polynomial time
and this is a concept known as
fixed parameter tractability what that
means is that as long as the parameter
that measures the hardness and in this
case it's the size of a vertex cover for
your graph as long as that parameter is
small or fixed then you can solve that
problem in polynomial time and that is
what this here says so as long as the
parameter is fixed the problem is
tractable if the parameter is not fixed
so for example it is some function of n
then the problem is not tractable and
this of course is a super neat technique
for solving vertex cover and actually
2.4 to the power of K is actually a very
bad exponent here we only did that
because it was easier to explain the
problem that way the currently best
algorithms have a exponential factor of
about 1.3 to the power of K actually a
current state of the art is that you can
solve vertex cover in 1.3 to the power
of K times some polynomial time now the
polynomial here that depends on certain
analysis factors and so on but the
important thing here is to see first of
all vertex cover as fixed parameter
tractable and second of all the base of
the exponent is actually really good
it's only 1 point 3 to the power of K</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
