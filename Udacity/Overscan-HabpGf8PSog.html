the big screen but before we look
towards the future let's start with a
trip to the past first you need to be
aware of something called overscan when
you're designing your game overscan
refers to a problem with many older in
some modern TVs basically some older
CRTs had trouble centering images and
there was some variability in how
different models did it the solution was
to Center an image as best they could
and then slightly enlarge it to make
sure it would take a pole screen
unfortunately this meant that the edges
of the image would sometimes be cut off
so here for example our Androids feet
might not be visible surprisingly even
modern flat-screen tvs suffer from this
problem although for different technical
reasons and to a lesser degree here's
what to do I'd recommend establishing a
safe zone for important content your
best bet is to avoid placing important
screen elements within about 5% from
each edge of the display 5% is a rough
guideline and that's because the over
scant amount varies on different
televisions here's how that might look
on a 1080 pixel screen we could add a 96
pixel margin on the left and right edges
and a 54 pixel margin on the top and
bottom edges this is just for
illustration check out the instructor
notes for more details on the specific
margins you should add if you're
designing a TV app then you don't need
to worry about overscan if you're using
Leanback fragments for example the
Browse fragment you see here
automatically applies overscan margins
to your layouts if you're building a
game that will run on both a mobile
device and a TV then at runtime you
might want to detect what type of device
you're running on so you can adjust how
the screen space is used you can do this
using the UI mode manager and there's
more details on this in a building TV
app section of this course</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
