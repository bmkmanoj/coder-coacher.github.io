notion of random events that their
events in the universe that are
inherently random and we could count
things like radioactive decay with a
Geiger counter and use that to generate
randomness from physical events thermal
noise is an easier thing to measure in
this circumstances if you can measure
that precisely enough it also depends on
quantum mechanics at some level and
produces a roundness and middie modern
processors have ways of generating a
small amount of randomness by measuring
thermal noise and the processor whether
it's really physically random depends on
a lot of other things you can also look
at things that actually happen and think
that they're random maybe if they're key
presses or user actions maybe those are
random an example of this is when we
generate a new key using GPG it will ask
you to generate when you start to
generate a key it says we need lots of
random bytes and you can perform some
type of action like moving the mouse
using the disk to help generate more
randomness for it and humans aren't good
at doing random stuff when we move the
mess we're probably moving it in a
pattern when we type on the keyboard
maybe where we're doing things that are
not very random so unless you're
generating your ends from quantum
physics there's always some question
whether it's really random enough or
whether you could predict the particular
motions I took and certainly given that
this has been recorded and released the
fake key that I generated for Alisa P
hacker should not be used for any secure
purpose so this approach of waiting for
physically random events is okay for GPG
maybe because someone using it is
probably patient enough to be willing to
sit around for a while doing random
stuff as well as a human can to generate
a key this would not work very well when
you need more randomness more quickly
and this happens every time you do a web
transaction every time someone does a
secure web session any time you see the
lock key in your browser
there's a protocol going on called TLS
we'll talk about that more in a later
unit but one thing that that requires is
a new random key for each
secure web session I don't think many
people would tolerate being asked to
move around their Mouse and do strange
things to generate enough randomness in
the hopes that that key is secured every
time you connect to a website so we need
something better we need a way to take a
little bit of physical randomness and
that's usually known as the seed that's
the initial state and that's the input
to what's known as a pseudo-random
number generator and that produces a
long sequence is longer than the amount
of physical randomness we started with
of random bits so that's our goal to
take a small amount of physical
randomness some source of entropy that
we can use as a seed have some function
that we'll compute from that seed a long
sequence of apparently random bits</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
