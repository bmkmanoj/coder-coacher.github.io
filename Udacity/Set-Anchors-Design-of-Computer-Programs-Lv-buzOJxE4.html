together very nicely the only thing
we're missing is set anchors we have to
somehow take a row and the row number
within the board and figure out where
all the anchors are and what the values
of those anchors are so find the anchors
we can do that within the row an anchor
is something that's next to it an
existing letter that will get most of
the anchors but not quite all of them
because notice if we didn't have this
row here we wouldn't know that that spot
is inane to find all the anchors we're
going to have to look at all the rows or
at least the two adjacent rows on either
side to find what the anchors are in
terms of the set can anything go there
as in this anchor any letter can appear
there or is it a restricted set like
this one that we're also going to have
to know what are the other crosswords so
here if there's only a you there and
nothing down below this is the edge of
the board or there's empty stuff on down
below then this anchor can only be the
letters that fit in there to make a word
going in this direction so let's dive
right into defining set anchors this is
different than most of the functions
written so far and that it actually
mutates the row rather than returning a
result and we start in the normal way
we're going to iterate over the row the
good parts of the row and then what I'm
going to do is take the IJ position in
the board and find all the neighbors for
that port that is all the squares in the
north south east and west location and
then i'm going to say what are the
anchors well if the square is the star
the starting square then that's an
anchor so by definition otherwise if the
square is empty and any of the neighbors
is a letter than that's an acre now I've
arranged that neighbors of board is a
function that returns a neighbors in
this order north south east and west and
now I'm saying we're operating on a row
if the neighbor to the north where the
south is a letter then we have a
crossword that we have to deal with if
not then it's an unrestricted anchor so
what do I want to do if I have these
crosswords I want to find the crossword
on the board what does that mean well in
this location right here which would be
Row 2 in column 2 I want to say that the
word on the board is an empty square
followed by you so if I go into the
interpreter I want to be able to have
this interaction where here's my board
now if I find crosswords within that
board from position 22 thats that
position right there right after the a
and above the you what I want to say is
that there's a word and the word is a
dot followed by you there it is if we
fill in that anchor we're going to have
a word which is a dot followed by you
and where does the word start well it
starts in position two it could have
started someplace else if we had a big
board there might have been a word that
started all the way up here and went
down and for example we're not actually
going to call fine cross word on
positions that aren't anchors but if we
did it would still work and so if we
find crosswords from position one two
that's the position where the a is
what's the cross word that intersects
through that a well that's jag and it
begins in row number one so now we're up
here we found the crosswords we found
the row that the crossword begins when
we found what the word is and now we're
saying we're going to fill in this
location it's going to be an anchor and
it's an anchor where the letters are all
the letters with which we can replace
the dot in dot you and make something
which is a word and we can go back to
our interpreter and test that out we can
say if w is the dot you then what is
this anchor of all the letters where w
replaced by a letter is in words that's
the anchor with x m and n as possibility
and now we're going to say insert that
anchor into rho sub I so insert into
this spot to the right of the a above
the you the anchor that says an X and M
or an n can occur right in that location
so that's setting the anchor if there
are cross letters above or below
otherwise we have an unrestricted anchor
for example this anchor here to the left
of the D any letter can go in there and
we've already defined the global
variable any to be the anchor that
allows any letter to occur</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
