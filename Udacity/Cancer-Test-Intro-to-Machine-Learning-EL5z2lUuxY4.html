unit see there's a specific cancer that
occurs in 1% of the population and the
test for this cancer and with 90% chance
it is positive if we have this cancer
see that's usually called the
sensitivity of a test but the test
sometimes is positive even if you don't
have C so let's say with another 90%
chance it is negative if you don't have
C there's usually called the space C
tivity so you as my question without
further symptoms you take the test and
the test comes back as positive what do
you think is now the probability of
having that specific type of cancer to
answer this let's draw a diagram so
pause these are all the people and some
of them exactly 1% health cancer 99% is
cancer-free we know there is a test that
if you have cancer correctly this
diagnosis with 90% chance so if you draw
the area where the test is positive
cancer and test positive then this area
over here is 90 percent of the cancer
circle however that isn't the full truth
the test Sanders is positive even if the
person doesn't have cancer in fact in
our case that happen to be in 10% of all
cases so if you have to add more area is
as big as 10% of this large area there
is as big as 10% of this large area
where the test might go positive but the
person doesn't have cancer so this blue
area is 10% of all the area over here -
the little small cancer circle and
clearly all the area outside these
circles corresponds the situation of no
cancer and the test is negative so let
me ask you again
suppose you have a positive test what do
you think with a prior probability of
cancer 1% a sensitivity and specificity
of 90% do you think your new chances are
now 90% or 8% or still just 1%</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
