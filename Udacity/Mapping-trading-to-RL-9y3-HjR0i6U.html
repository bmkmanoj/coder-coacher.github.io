carefully how we map trading to an RL
problem so first of all the environment
here is really the market our state that
we're going to consider includes things
like market features prices whether
we're holding the stock I'll list a few
of those items right here our actions
are things like buy and sell and
potentially do nothing is also an
allowable action so let's think about
this in the context of trying to learn
how to trade a particular stock so we've
got this historical time series and
let's say this vertical line is today
now we can look back over time to infer
the state of the stock so what are the
Bollinger Band values and things like
that
now we process that and decide what's
our action let's suppose that we decide
to buy so once we buy we're now holding
long that's part of our state we go
forward we're now in a new state where
the price has gone up
we're holding long let's suppose we
decide to sell at that point so we've
had two actions while we've been in two
states and state one we were not holding
we executed the action by went forward
in time we're holding long now and then
we execute the action sell note that we
made money here and that's our reward
our so just to recap for a moment the
policy that we learn tells us what to do
at each time we evaluate state and we're
going to learn that we haven't talked
yet about how we learned the policy but
we're going to learn the policy by
looking at how we accrue money or don't
based on the actions we take in the
environment</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
