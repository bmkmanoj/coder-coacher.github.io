we've got our our forum handling code
and right now two sprints thanks every
time let's actually use our new
verification functions so I've added a
line here
I'm calling the valid month function
that we just wrote and I'm sending in as
the first argument to that function the
month parameter that was included in our
request and so this will indicate
whether our response was valid or not
and I'm going to go ahead and add this
for the day in the year as well okay so
we've got these three variables and now
let's actually check them if not user
month and user day and user year we're
going to re-render the form again if all
three of these aren't true we're going
to render our form else if they are all
true we're going to say thanks which we
have down here
so to recap we're getting our three
parameters from the request we're
running them through our valid month day
and year functions and if they are not
all true we rewrite the form and if they
are all true we say thanks that's a
totally valid day all right let's give
this a shot in our browser okay so here
we are on our browser I'm going to type
in a day again okay so I've typed in
what I think is a valid month date and
year and when I hit submit our browser
says thanks that's a totally valid day
and let's go to the form again and this
time we're going to type in something
invalid okay now I've got an invalid
month and you know normal day and year
and when I click Submit the form just
clears because we sent back the form
again we can improve this a little bit
and let's start doing that now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
