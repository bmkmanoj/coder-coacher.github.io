there's actually several ways one ways
we can charge by friction and if you've
ever rubbed your feet on the carpet and
then touched your friend who is standing
nearby and giving them a shock you have
charged yourself by friction and what's
going on here the rubbing between two
objects actually causes one to steal the
electrons of the others
now it doesn't steal the protons because
protons aren't well relatively gigantic
compared to electrons electrons are tiny
tiny little guys and so it turns out
that just simple rubbing can actually
cause an exchange of charge leaving one
object positive and one negative
in fact this sort of charging happens in
cumulonimbus clouds and these are the
sorts of clouds that cause lightning and
what happens is little drops of ice or
water are constantly moving around in
this cloud and as these droplets pass
through the cloud rubbing against each
other and passing through different
regions of the cloud they gradually
either accumulate or lose electrons
depending on what they're moving on and
the details of the actual situation but
what this does is it creates a motion of
charge whether this is positive or
negative whether it's going up or down
doesn't really matter what happens is
charge
separates and what that usually leads to
this chaotic motion of particles is a
buildup of minus charges on the bottom
of the cloud and positive charges on the
top and we've already shown that these
minus charges lead to corresponding
positive charges building up in the
ground we're starting to really
understand lightning here as well as
electricity so we can use charging by
friction to create a charged object so
let's say we've created a positively
charged ball a good way to do that is by
rubbing something metallic with let's
say rabbit fur anyway so we have this
positively charged ball and we know that
if we bring it near to this ball will
induce some polarization negative
charges on this side and positive on
that side fine but what happens if this
ball touches that ball so we bring this
over let them touch and remember they're
both conductors so I wanna know what do
you think will happen when I touch this
ball that do you think nothing will
happen do you think that some positive
charges will flow from ball B to ball a
do you think that some negative charges
will flow from A to B what do you think
that all of the positive charges on ball
B will flow to ball a think about what
it means for something to be a conductor
and then give this question a shot</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
