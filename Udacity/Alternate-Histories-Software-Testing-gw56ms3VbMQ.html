where we explore what would have
happened to the world at some historical
event turned out differently so for
example we might have an alternate
history novel exploring what would have
happened if the Allies hadn't won World
War two what we're going to do is look
at a few alternate history examples
where we're going to try to explore the
question what would have happened if
certain groups of people in the past had
use random testing in addition to
whatever other kinds of testing they
were do and we're going to sort of
specifically focus on the question would
random testing have been likely to alter
the outcome of some famous software bugs
or would have not made much difference
but it has not been a very useful
technique so the first case study we're
going to look at is the F div bug in
Intel Pentium chips and so in 1994 it
came to the world's attention that the
eff give instruction supported by
involves pentium processor was flawed
and so active is an instruction that you
would use to perform floating-point
division before writing assembly
language for a pentium we would issue
the f give instruction with two operands
and what it would do is compute the
quotient of a divided by B and so what
happened is there was a bug enough div
and what had happened was the
implementation of F div that is to say
hardware implementation of this machine
instruction was intended to be very fast
the Pentium was at the time a very high
performance processor and the way if div
was fast at least in part was because it
did part of its work using cable hookups
so there was this table of values stored
in the Pentiums hardware what had
happened was somewhere on the way to
fabrication some of the values had not
been loaded correctly into the table so
part of the lookup table i believe it
was five entries contained the wrong
results and for some values of a and b
pass to the f give instruction looking
up these wrong results in the lookup
table would cause it to do the wrong
thing this wasn't an extremely major
error in a sense so too it would return
a million instead of 0 but rather was
often sort of some number of places
after the decimal point the reason is
the flaw is in F div went undetected for
some time was that only about one in
nine billion randomly selected inputs
would actually trigger the bug and so
now the question we need to ask
ourselves is given this relatively low
observed failure rate on random inputs
would random testing have been a good
way to find the penny MF div bug and the
answer is almost certainly yes so we're
going to do now is try to figure out
about how long it would have taken Intel
to find this bug using random testing
and so the first thing we're going to
need to do is make an assumption about
how many tests per second they can run
and so it's not as if in 1994 they had
modern one two gigahertz hardware
available but rather these Pentiums ran
at around 60 megahertz and so what we're
going to save
sake of argument is that it took 10
microseconds to perform an active and
verify its result so in other words at
60 megahertz in other words at 60
megahertz I'm assuming that it would
take about six hundred cycles to check a
particular input for F div so now let's
try to work out the math</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
