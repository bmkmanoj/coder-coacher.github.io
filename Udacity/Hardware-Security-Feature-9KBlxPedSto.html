security support in iOS devices each iOS
device has a dedicated AES 256 crypto
engine built into the direct memory
access path between the flash storage
and the main system memory
this makes file encryption highly
efficient recorded aes 256 means that
the key length is 256 bit the devices
unique ID or UID and a device group ID
or GID RA es 256-bit keys fused or
compiled into the application processor
and secure Enclave during manufacturing
this means that no software or firmware
can read them directly they can see only
the results of encryption or decryption
operations performed by the dedicated
AES engines implemented in silicon using
a UID or GID as a key this is the
important feature because the keys are
stored securely in Hardware the you IDs
are unique to each device and are not
recorded by Apple or its suppliers the G
IDs are common to all processors in a
class of devices for example all devices
using the Apple a8 processor
the T IDs are used for tasks such as
delivering system installation and
updates again a unique feature of iOS
devices is that the UID and GID keys are
directly burning the silicon and they
can be only accessed by the cocoa engine
and a crypto engine itself is part of
the hardware</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
