view controller in the objective-c
project we can see that it has three
properties a gif image view a gif and
then in the dot M file a caption text
field if we look through the
implementation file we see the view
controller lifecycle methods we see a
bunch of code for formatting the caption
text field we see the UI text field
delegate methods the code for adjusting
the keyboard and then a method called
present preview okay here we are back in
the gif editor view controller in the
Swift project and we'll start by adding
those properties we already have a
property for the gif image view so we
need to add a property for the caption
text field which we can drag in from
storyboard and we'll replace this gif
URL property with a property called gif
and we're not really sure when this gift
property is going to be set so we'll
make it an optional next you're going to
want to go back to the method convert
video to gif this is in the UI view
controller record extension now instead
of passing the gift URL from the convert
video to gif method let's go ahead and
initialize an instance of the gift class
and then instead of passing the gif URL
will just pass the gif as a parameter to
the display gift method and then we'll
go back to our gift editor view
controller and set the gif image view in
view will appear so instead of gift from
recording it should be gif gif image now
let's run it and see how it looks this
will also tell us if everything is in
order with our gift class alright ok
let's launch the camera super we can
still see our gift so it looks like
everything's in order with the gift
class hopefully you will be able to see
your gift too and now we'll move on to
implement the UI text field delegate
methods</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
