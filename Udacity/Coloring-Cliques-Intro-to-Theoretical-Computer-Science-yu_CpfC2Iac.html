right in in the unit we talked about a
problem called K coloring and just in
case you don't remember it let's go over
real quick let's say we had a graph and
let's say we wanted to give all of the
vertices different colors
well not different colors but we wanted
to give them colors so that neighboring
vertices never have the same color like
you would on a map for instance let's go
ahead and start out with Crean and its
color this one that means if we want to
move to another color we can color the
adjacent ones a different color but we
can't color any of these green because
this is connected to all the vertices so
let's start off with this one we can
color that red but that means we can't
color that red we can color one of these
red so let's go ahead and do that too
let's color this one red that means that
this one can no longer be colored red
either neither of these can be colored
red or green
so let's color them purple and now we've
completely colored this graph with three
colors and at least for K greater than
two whether a graph can be colored and K
many colors is an np-complete problem
now in order to show the K coloring is
complete really what we can do is simply
reduce clique to K coloring and there
are two basic facts that help us to do
this the first question we need to
answer is that if a graph contains a
clique of size k then how many colors
are needed to color the graph at minimum
and the second question is conversely if
a graph can be colored with at most K
colors how big can the largest clique in
the graph be and go ahead and enter your
responses and the textbox is provided</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
