but what else can we do with fractions
with the counting numbers we could add
subtract multiply and divide we can do
the same operations with fractions you
might be asking yourself what's an
operation an operation is just something
that takes input values and produces an
output value like addition we could have
two plus three two and three are the
inputs and I get five as the output or
it could have 4 times 7 4 and 7 are my
inputs and I get 28 as the output an
operation just produces a new value for
now we're going to continue working with
fractions and look at multiplication
we're going to return to our chocolate
bars here's my one chocolate bar this
time I'm going to split up my chocolate
bar into pieces I'm going to find a
fraction of a fraction so what is
one-third of one half of the chocolate
bar let's find out here's a drawing of a
chocolate bar and now first I'm going to
split it in half so I started with one
bar and now I have half a bar I want to
find one third of that one half so I
need to take this half of a chocolate
bar and split it up into thirds or three
equal pieces I've slipped my half into
thirds now and now I just need one third
of the one half so this piece right here
represents one third of my one half so i
found one third of one half it's this
shape piece but i'm wondering what
fraction is this piece compared to the
original candy bar i can split up my
original candy bar into the same size
pieces as this one that will let me see
what fraction is this of my candy bar so
visually I can see that this piece is 16
of my candy bar so let's pair this with
some math one third of one half has to
be equal to 16 but I need to figure out
what did I do to these two fractions how
did I combine them to get 16 let's
answer this question with a quiz</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
