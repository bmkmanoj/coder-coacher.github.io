side of an application and modules a
container that houses and encapsulates
the different components of an
application now it's time to adding
controllers this is where we really
start to see angular coming together but
first time to play with some more toys
every lego model can be put on display
but not all of them actually do anything
this lego car has wheels and it can move
it's not just for show the power of
single page apps is that you can
interact with them angular controllers
gives us the ability to provide both
data and functionality to an app's
templates let's add some data to our
apps we can use yeoman to generate the
files we need let's make the controller
first we need the yo angular controller
command and let's create a controller
named menu this creates a menu file in
the controllers directory it also
updates the index file to include this
new controller while we're setting up
our app I want this project to start
with a clean slate so let's remove this
default main file here in the controller
folder
and in the view folder
now in our new menu controller let's
delete the functions default content a
controller just like the other
components in angular lives inside of a
module the module has already been
created so we get it and add the
controller to it to actually create a
controller use angular's controller
method the name of the controller comes
first and then the function a controller
is a constructor function properties of
the constructed object can be used as
variables in templates let's add
properties for an ID a name and image
and a rating and I'll use these values
we've added properties to the controller
and the controller to the module so
angular knows about our controller how
to create it and the data to use when
creating it let's add this controller to
the template but first we actually need
a template let's run yo angular View
menu to generate an HTML template with
the name menu the generator creates our
template in the views directory now that
we have our template we can add it to
the page this line is left over from the
main file we deleted let's update it to
use our menu files we can swap out main
here for menu and main controller we can
replace with menu controller as menu
just like we use that strange ng-app
attribute called the directive to add a
module to the page we need to use this
directive to include our new template
the directive to load the controller is
ng dash controller then we pass it the
name of the controller II want menu
controller and the variable name to use
for instantiation menu I promise we'll
look at directives very soon refreshing
the page shows us the templates contents
not very exciting right let's update the
template to include our data here's what
the generator gives us by default for a
template and here's the structure I want
with the HTML structure set we need to
add in the dynamic content remember that
dynamic content needs to go inside an
expression for the heading we want the
menu items name so that's menu dot name
remember menu here comes from the
gee controller attribute which creates
an instance of the controller and names
it menu adding the rest of the
information gives us his final template
on a side note we're not adding the
items image with an image tag just yet
we'll fix this in a bit and here's our
app notice that our templates receiving
its data from the controller and
everything's displaying correctly
awesome what do you think about what
we've learned so far you now should have
a good understanding that a controller
provides the initial state for a
template and how to use expressions to
display that information</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
