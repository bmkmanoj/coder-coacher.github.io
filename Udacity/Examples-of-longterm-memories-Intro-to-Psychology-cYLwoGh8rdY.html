the day you got your driver's license do
you remember the first place you drove
to or who was in the car with you do you
remember the price of gas or was it a
warm day a cold day sunny rainy all
these things that you can remember about
the day you got your driver's license
constitute what we call episodic memory
now episodic memory is memory for
autobiographical events here we're
looking at information remember that is
both temporal as well as contextual
meaning when and where the event
occurred another type of memory that was
related to but different than episodic
memory are semantic memories semantic
memories are memories about general
facts or general knowledge so for
example an episodic memory might be
remembering your 16th birthday party the
people who were there in your favorite
song that was playing on the radio
semantic memories can be things such as
general knowledge like things you've
learned in school such as e equals
mc-squared but we're also going to talk
about a different type of memory and
that's declarative memory and we're
gonna go back to Lauren for that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
