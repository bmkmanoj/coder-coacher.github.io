and the ones we've been working with
have definitely gotten gradually more
complex so this one is another step up
we have three times the quantity 2 to
the 3 t minus 2 plus 6 equals 15 now you
can approach this a question in exactly
the same way as when we did just before
this you'll just have a few more steps
at the end to reach the solution then
you might want to take a couple seconds
right now and pause the video to try
solving all the way to t on your own if
you feel like that might be a little bit
much let's go through it in a slightly
more step-by-step manner now of course
there are many different ways to solve
this problem and I'm just going to show
one of them first we're going to treat 2
to the 3 t minus 2 as our variable so
rewrite the equation isolating 2 to the
3 t minus 2 on the side if 2 to the 3 t
minus two seems like something sort of
complicated to work with and sort of
weird to think about as a variable then
you can substitute in another letter
like you for instance in place of this
whole thing then just solve for you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
