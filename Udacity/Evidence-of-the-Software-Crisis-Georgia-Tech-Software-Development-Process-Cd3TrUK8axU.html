that characterize the software crisis
let's see what was the evidence that
there was indeed a crisis so what I want
to discuss now is the result of a study
performed by Davis in 1990s so in even
more recent times than the 60s and the
70s and the study was performed on nine
software projects they were totally net
cost around seven million dollars and
I'm going to show you how this project
went using this representation this pie
representation in which I'm going to
discuss what each of the segments of the
pie represent so let's start looking at
the first one this is the software that
was usable as delivered other software
was delivered and usable either after
some changes or after some major
modifications so with an additional cost
involved but the striking piece of
information here is that the vast
majority of the software so these two
slices were software there was either
delivered but never successfully used or
software there was not even delivered
and this corresponded to five over the
seven total million dollars for all the
projects so clearly this shows a pretty
grim picture for software development
and its success in short there was clear
evidence the software was becoming too
difficult to build and that the software
industry was facing a crisis and this is
what led to the NATO software
engineering conference that was held in
January 1969 which is what we can
consider the birth of software
engineering and what I'm showing here is
a drawing of the proceedings for that
conference and if you look at the class
notes you can see a link to the actual
proceedings in case you're interested in
looking at the issues that were
discussed</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
