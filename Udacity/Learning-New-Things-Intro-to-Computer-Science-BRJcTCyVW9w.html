about how to learn new things when
you're trying to develop as a programmer
as well as trying to understand how to
solve new problems in CS 101 I tried to
keep things as simple as possible using
only a very small subset of Python the
reason for this was to focus on learning
new concepts in computer science rather
than learning lots and lots of different
Python constructs and I think that's the
right way to begin as a computer
scientist you should learn to construct
programs using only a few simple things
that you understand well focusing on the
problems to solve the algorithms to
solve them and understanding how things
work rather than learning lots of new
language constructs but if you want to
become a better programmer well then you
need to start learning more of the
language and most of our courses don't
focus on that they focus on concepts
important for problem solving
understanding what's going on in a
computation and analyzing and reasoning
about them but to become a better
programmer you also need to learn more
of the language and the main goal of
this unit is to help you learn how to
actually learn things on your end
becoming a better programmer really
depends on two things depends on
experience and you get experienced by
solving more and more problems and it
depends on knowledge and you gain
knowledge also by solving problems but
it's a different kind of thing knowledge
means learning more language constructs
learning more algorithms knowing more
different ways of solving problems
that's different from the experience you
get by solving a lot of problems
yourself and both of those are important
for becoming a better programmer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
