that's helpful for seeing the
distribution of a variable called a box
plot now if you're unfamiliar with a box
plot you can find resources in the
instructor notes and there's also a link
to Udacity statistic class so you can
test your knowledge you may recall
earlier that we split friend count by
gender and a pair of histograms using
facet wrap the code looked like this
instead of using these histograms we're
going to generate box plots of friend
count by gender so we can quickly see
the differences between the
distributions and in particular we're
going to see the difference between the
medians of the two groups and remember
again that the cue plot function
automatically generates histograms when
we pass it a single variable so we need
to add a parameter to tell queue plot
that we want a different type of plot to
do that we're gonna use the giome called
box plot now I'm gonna use the same data
set as before so I'm gonna keep this and
cue plot now what's different about box
plots is that the y axis is going to be
our friend count the x axis on the other
hand is going to be our categorical
variables for male and female or gender
notice that we use the continuous
variable friend count as Y and the
grouping or the categorical variable as
X this will always be true for your box
plots I forgot a parenthesis here and
then let me just reformat my code so it
looks a little bit cleaner there we go
running this code we can see that we get
our two box plots let's zoom in to get a
closer look the boxes here and here
cover the middle 50% of values or what's
called the interquartile range and I
know these boxes are hard to see since
we have so many outliers on this plot
each of these tiny little dots is an
outlier in our data we can also see that
the y axis is capturing all the friend
counts from 0 all the way up to 5
thousand so we're not emitting any user
data in this plot and finally this
horizontal line which you may have
noticed that first is the median for the
two blocks plots and you might be
wondering what makes an outlier an
actual outlier and well we usually
consider outliers to be just outside of
one and a half times the IQR from the
median since there are so many outliers
in these plots let's adjust our code to
focus on just these two boxes we'll have
you do this in the next programming
exercise see if you can alter our code
make that adjustment</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
