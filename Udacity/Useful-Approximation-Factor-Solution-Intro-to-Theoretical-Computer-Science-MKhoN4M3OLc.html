is no useful approximation factor at all
and the reason for that is that the
approximation factor depends on the size
of the minimum vertex cover for the
input graph so the first thing to notice
is of course that it's not a constant
factor approximation algorithm because
we can be given any graph and that graph
can of course have different size vertex
covers let's say we wanted this to be at
least a factor two approximation
algorithm what that would mean is that
one plus K over N minus 2k is smaller
than or equal to 2 so when you solve
this what you get is that k must be
smaller than or equal to and thirds now
seeing this you might be inclined to
think why isn't this answer here correct
because if K which is the size of the
smallest vertex cover is less than or
equal to n thirds then most of the
vertices are in an independent set so
the answer could be if the independent
set is very large then we also have a
good approximation algorithm but the
problem of that is of course that in
order to really assess the quality of
the approximation you need to have an
exact solution and if you already have
an exact solution then approximation of
course makes no sense anymore so it's an
approximation factor that can only be
determined in hindsight once you have
calculated an optimum solution in which
case you don't need the approximation
anymore so this here is also not a
correct answer and the unfortunate thing
is is actually not a useful
approximation at all</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
