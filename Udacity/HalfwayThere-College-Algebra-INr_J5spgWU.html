right he was on the plane he's on the
plane going from home to the expo in the
city Udacity but grant is super
impatient and he would really love to
find out where the halfway point between
his hometown and Udacity is he found out
earlier that the exact distance between
these two points is the square root of
530,000 in miles of course should he
just measure half of the square root of
530,000 along this line that doesn't
seem like it'd be very exact or very
easy to do either but just by looking at
our graph I'd like you to give me an
estimate for where you think the
midpoint is that is what are the
coordinates of the point that's halfway
between these two points along this line</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
