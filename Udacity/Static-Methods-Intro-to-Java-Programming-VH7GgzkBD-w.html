talked about classes and methods and
about the fact that a method should
always belong to a particular class
whose objects are responsible for
carrying it out sometimes that's not as
easy as it sounds let's go back to a
program that you saw in lesson 5 in the
elevator demo we read in a number and
then we first checked whether it was a
valid integer whether it was within
range and only then were we able to do
any work with it it would be nice if we
could put all of this code in a separate
method and then I'd like to call that
method and somewhat this fashion so I
want to read a number between 1 and 18 I
want to read it from this scanner and I
wanted to have the prompt to be floor
and of course the reason I want that is
then I can reuse the read between method
again when I want to read some other
value that's maybe between one and a
hundred and maybe it's a temperature so
like so many of us the read between
method is probably wondering where do I
belong well in which class do you think
the read between methods should be put
the system class is scanner class the
elevator demo or maybe somewhere else
just think about it and give me your
best guess</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
