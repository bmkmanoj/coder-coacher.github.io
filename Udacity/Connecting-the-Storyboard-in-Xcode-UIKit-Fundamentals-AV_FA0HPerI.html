table into the view from the object menu
it'll automatically expand to fill the
whole view you'll want to drag this
upper border down a bit so that it ends
up below the status bar next we bring up
the constraints menu and add constraints
for the borders and once the table is in
place we can connect the data source so
ctrl click on the table to open up the
pop-up connections menu then you can
drag from this datasource property to
the view controller icon you're probably
familiar with those steps by now here
come the two new steps add a cell to the
table by going to the attributes
inspector and setting prototype cells to
one if you click on the cell you'll see
it needs a reuse identifier let's go
into the project navigator so we can
double check what the cell was called in
the villain view controller here you can
see the villains cell is being DQ'd so
here we can set our reuse identifier to
be villain cell by the way when you're
entering text into these cells make sure
you always hit return otherwise
storyboard won't save it this is weird
behavior and the source of a lot of
frustration for both new and
accomplished developers and those are
the steps to setting up a table view and
storyboard so let's run it and see how
it looks so you can see that the
pictures and names are there but not the
evil schemes that's because of the cell
style if you go back into the attributes
inspector you'll see this drop-down menu
labeled style here you can see your
options for cell styles and we'll have
more details on that in the next section</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
