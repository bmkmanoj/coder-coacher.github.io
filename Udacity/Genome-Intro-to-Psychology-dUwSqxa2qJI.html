over three billion letters or
nucleotides in each one of our cells but
how does this DNA actually make who we
are right it's a very good question and
it's kind of hard to conceive that so
much information can fit in such a small
space it's important to recognize that
we call the total amount of genetic
information your genome and within
everybody's genome there are segments
called genes that code for something
typically proteins well what do you mean
by coding for proteins though proteins
are a large part of what makes up who we
are so the physical stuff like the the
flesh the skin the hair when you look at
another person who they are is coded for
by these genes which are segments of
their genome now genes only make up 2%
of the human genome then once we know
the other 98% well that other 90% is
still very important now a large part of
it we know regulates that 2% it
determines how those genes are turned on
and off at the right time in the right
place and there's also another bit of
that 98% that we don't know what's going
on yet and we're actively researching
that and learning more every day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
