network two machines each with a single
interface to each other so host 1 and
host 2 would be connected by two
Ethernet adapters or network interfaces
and each of these would have a LAN or
physical or MAC address now a host that
wants to send a Datagram to another host
can simply send that data gram via its
Ethernet adapter with the destination
MAC address of the other host that it
wants to receive the frame frames can
also be sent to a broadcast destination
MAC address which would mean that the
Datagram would be sent to every host
that it was connected to on the local
area network now of course typically
what happens is a host knows a DNS name
or an IP address of another host but it
may not know the hardware or MAC address
of the adapter on the host that it wants
to send its Datagram to so we need to
provide a way for a host to learn the
MAC address of another host the solution
to this is a protocol called ARP or the
address resolution protocol</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
