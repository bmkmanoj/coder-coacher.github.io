functions for on connection suspended
and on connection failed for now in
these I'm just going to log that the
event has happened and you can see this
here log that I log tagged Google API
connections been suspended and similar
here Google API connection has failed
now we're almost done and we're almost
ready to start getting location updates
from our phone now there's one more
thing that needs to be implemented and
that's the on location change to
callback now I've created a simple
skeleton for it here here you can see
what I'm doing is the unlock a shin
change callback gets a location that I
call location with a lowercase L and I'm
just gonna log the location dot to
string and I'm gonna set text location
dot to string on that as well so we can
see the full location details so let's
run this code and see what actually
happens here we can see what has
happened after I've run the code and
it's not the friendliest in the world is
it but we can see that it's basically
working we can see our latitude and our
longitude and acceleration and altitude
and even bearing so all this is just
because we converted the location to
string but let's pull out say for
example the latitude and get the
latitude information and put it in you
can actually see that it updated there
and it just updated again
because of slight movements and me
moving the phone so let's update this
and see what happens
now if you'll recall I just had said
that txt output to be location dot to
string but let's make this something a
little bit more interesting for example
let's pull out the latitude from this
and we'll work with that and the easiest
way to do this would be I'll just paste
the code in and we can see here that
what we're going to do is we're going to
set the text to be location don't get
latitude now this returns a double so of
course we have to pass that double 2.2
string in order to convert that double
to a string so now just the latitude
from the location object will be written
to the text for you so let's run that
and take a look so now here we can see
the same the same application is running
but I've just gotten the latitude of my
current location and I've written it
into the text label that's a lot
friendlier and you could use that for
example to have a text label for
latitude another one for longitude
another one for altitude etc etc etc so
very straightforward and congratulations
you've just gotten your first location
updates</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
