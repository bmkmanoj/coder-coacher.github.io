coordination remember that we have
heterogeneous distributed application
multiple things going on at the same
time and these multiple things have to
synchronize across certain actions okay
and how is that going to be provided the
two main categories of synchronization
are synchronous applications synchronous
communications and asynchronous
communications synchronous means that
when one piece of the application
initiates that particular message or
interaction that it waits until it gets
a reply back a response back before
continuing often synchronous types of
interactions are clocked that means
there's some heartbeat or other measure
of when it can do certain things on the
other hand asynchronous communication
means the client can continue to execute
after it's sent the message and it's
notified when the response comes back
and it can take appropriate steps at
that point obviously asynchronous is
more general but writing code for
dealing with asynchronous coordination
is a little trickier it makes it a
little harder to understand so once
again there's a trade-off another
question with respect to coordination is
who's in charge here okays of the client
or the server you've no doubt seen
situations where the server is capable
of pushing things out to the clients
such as web pages which want to update
with current events or it could be that
the client requests information that is
it pulls from the server deciding how
you're going to deal with that is a key
design question in any distributed
application so always the case with such
applications that robustness is
important what this means is that the
system can deal with situations where
one or more of its components goes down
think that you send out a message and
you don't get any response back and the
visa you don't get any response back is
that the piece of the application you
were dealing with goes down how does
your part of the application deal with
that think for example if your user
facing you don't want to just wait there
and leave the user in limbo
you want to provide some perhaps some
time out on the message acknowledgement
and be able to let the user know what
went on what went on similar to
robustness is availability how does the
system appear to the user as far as
being available stats 24 7 type
application does it have set maintenance
times how does it deal with load
situations that is does it get so slow
that the user gets frustrated all those
kinds of questions persistence we've
already mentioned in general this means
how is server state-maintained one
obvious approaches with a database it
might be a file system but nevertheless
the choice has to be made and if you've
got multiple clients talking to the
system how is that concurrency handled
okay how does the server part of the
application deal with all these multiple
users related to that is the transaction
and integrity constraints which we
talked about on the previous issue</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
