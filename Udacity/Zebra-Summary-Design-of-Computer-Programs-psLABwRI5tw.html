our friend the zebra well we learned
that we took our approach of making a
concept inventory and then refining the
ideas and choosing simplest
implementation we could think of and
then doing a back of an envelope
calculation to say how long is it going
to take to run this simple
implementation and then refining the
code as necessary making it a little bit
faster by swapping around some of the
clauses and we also learned the idea of
building tools we built tools for timing
and counts and in general we learned
this idea of separation of aspects from
the program to try to keep the design as
clean as possible so that you could tell
what was working on getting the problem
right and what was working on making it
more efficient so in the end you might
say wow that was a clever solution it
was great to see how it works out but we
can see if we just follow the steps we
can arrive at a solution like that every
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
