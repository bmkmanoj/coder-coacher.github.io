compilers have a reputation as being
difficult and more complicated than
interpreters but notice here that the
compiler is actually in many ways
simpler than the interpreter it's it's
less lines of code overall in one reason
is because we didn't have to duplicate
effort here of saying first we need
constructors to say build up a literal
and then within match set have a
interpreter for that literal rather we
did it just once just once we said the
constructor for literal returns a
function which is going to be the
implementation of the compiler for that
type of pattern so it's very concise
most of these are one-liners maybe I
cheated a little bit and I replaced the
word text the word T to make it a little
bit shorter and fit on one line there's
only one that's complicated and that's
the star of X because it's recursive the
ones I haven't listed here is because
they're all the same as before so before
we get into star X let me note that I
didn't have to put down search here
because search is exactly the same as
before I didn't have to put down plus
because plus is exactly the same as as
before it's defined in terms of star
what is the definition of star one thing
we could return is the remainder could
be the text itself so star of something
you could choose not to take any of it
and return the entire text as a
remainder that's one possibility the
other possibility is we could apply the
pattern X from star X apply the pattern
X to the text and take those sets of
remainders and for every remainder
that's not the text itself because we
already took care of that we don't need
to take care of it again so for all the
remainders that are different from the
whole text then we go through and we
apply star of X to that remainder and we
get a new remainder and that's the
result so that's all we need for the
compiler result oh one piece was it was
missing is how do you interface the
match function which takes a pattern in
a text with this compiler where a
pattern is applied to the text and
that's one line which is slightly
different here before we call match set
in the previous implementation we had
match set of pattern
texts and your job then is to replace
that with the proper code for the
implementation that calls the compiler</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
