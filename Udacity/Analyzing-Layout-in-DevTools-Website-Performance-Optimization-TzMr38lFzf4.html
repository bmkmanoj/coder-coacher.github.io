browser right what happens if I rotate
my phone if the dimensions of the layout
viewport change the browser has to rerun
the layout step that's what happens
every time you rotate your phone or for
that matter resize your browser hmm I
see
so our examples are pretty simple but
could this possibly be a performance
bottleneck yep let's take a look at dev
tools I've captured a trace of Gizmodo
comm which is a popular news site if
you're curious you can grab this trace
from the instructor notes and follow
along let's take a look first of all
there's a ton of events here since we're
only interested in layout let's filter
out the loading scripting and painting
events okay here's the first layout
event check it out it took 145
milliseconds Wow what's a long time yeah
as you can see there are over 1,400
nodes in the tree huh but there are
other layout events in here
what's going on that's a great question
recall that anytime we update the render
tree either by modifying styles or the
content there's a good chance we have to
rerun layout and in this case it looks
like that's exactly what's happening the
page is adding new content and modifying
styles and hence we need to run layout a
few more times I see so how do you go
about optimizing for that it really
depends on a site but a good rule of
thumb is to batch updates to avoid
having multiple layout events</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
