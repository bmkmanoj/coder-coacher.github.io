cones so actually before we talk about
colorblindness I think it makes sense to
talk a little bit about color I think
that's a great idea because what exactly
is color so remember how we talked about
how sound is a wave yeah lights actually
a wave too and so what that means is
that well remember the properties of
waves remember which property
correspondent to pitch yeah that was
frequency exactly and so what would a
for example high frequency wave look
like it look like this and what about a
low frequency wave it would look like
this excellent that's perfect so high
frequency lots of fast oscillations low
frequency fewer waves per second slower
oscillations so what is frequency you
have to do with light waves what Lauren
with light we actually usually talk
about wavelength which is the distance
between let's say here and here and
light waves can have all sorts of
wavelengths but you can only see certain
wavelengths which wavelengths can we see
the smalls we can see is 400 nanometers
and the largest is about 750 but what's
a nanometer right well one nanometer is
actually equal to one billionth of a
meter well what's the difference between
the big ones and the small ones well
that's how we see color let me show you
something</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
