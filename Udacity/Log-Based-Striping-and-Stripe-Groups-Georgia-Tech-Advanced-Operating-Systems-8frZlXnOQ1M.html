striping in software so let's understand
that technology and a little bit more
detail you have clients on the local
area network that are writing to files
when a client makes a change to a file
the changes that are made by this client
to files are written to an append only
log and this append only log is a data
structure this log segment is a data
structure in the memory of the client in
the distributed file system and this
append only data structure contains the
changes made to files on this client
node and for instance this could be a
change for a particular file x this
could be the change for another file Z
and so on and so forth and this is a nap
in lowly data structure that is residing
a dis client similarly there is a log
segment that is available at this client
for the changes made to files on this
node and when this log segment fills up
beyond a certain capacity you decide on
a certain threshold and once that
threshold number of fragments have been
written in this log segment then you
decide that it's time now to write to
the disk so you take these log fragments
and compute the parity which is the
checksum or ECC whatever you may want to
call it and this becomes the log segment
that I wanted right to the disk and you
take this and stripe it across storage
service so you take this particular log
fragment along with its ECC and stripe
it on storage servers so that it is now
available on the storage system and as I
mentioned you want to do this
periodically in order to avoid a chance
of data loss due to failures of a
particular node and that's what you're
doing every periodically same thing is
happening on this so if you look at the
storage server you see that the storage
server has the log segments that have
been written by this client and the log
segment that has been written by the log
segment that has been written by this
client or
of this gets into the storage service
and the other thing that you want to do
is you don't want every log segment to
be written on all the disks available on
the local area network you don't want to
do that this is again concerned with
solving the small right problem and
therefore what we want to do is we want
to subset the storage service and say
that if let's say I have hundred storage
servers available on the local area
network I might decide that every log
segment is going to write its log over a
small fraction of that maybe 10 service
and this client may similarly choose a
subset of storage service to write it on
the subset of storage service that is
used for striping a given log segment is
called a stripe group for that
particular log segment</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
