so generative I build a model of each
class and then I compare it against all
of them discriminative I build a model
of the boundary between the classes so
we've talked a bunch about building some
discriminative one let's talk again
about building generative how might you
build a reasonable generative model of
each class of action okay well remember
one of the reasons we might want
generative models we might not have a
whole lot of examples so a simple thing
you might do is you've got a human
feature space and we've got seven things
apply to two images so we get 14 numbers
so you could use some sort of Gaussian
or maybe it's a Gaussian with diagonal
covariance so that you don't have to
worry about having too many points or
you might use a small number of multiple
a mixture of gaussians but the ideas you
would build a model a Gaussian model for
each of those classes and then what
you'll do is you compare the likelihoods
remember the likelihood was probability
of the data given the model right so I
build all the models then when the new
data comes in I evaluate the probability
of the data then if I have a prior then
what I'm going to do is I'm going to use
Bayes rule that's what it says here that
basically says I take my likelihood i
multiply that by the prior of my model
and that's proportional to my to my
total posterior if I don't have a prior
i might just select whichever one has
the highest life of it and by the way if
I don't have enough data to even build
some reasonable model of the densities I
might just use something like nearest
neighbor so the nice thing that we have
is that most the motion energy imagers
motion history images they're sort of
little global descriptors and the way
you do this is you're going to collect
these statistics on these global
descriptors in order to do recognition
one of the things that might be a little
less obvious is you can actually
recognize the action till it's done
right so I have this description that
goes back in time so I'm watching a
person sit down when they're done
sitting down I now have that chunk of
data that represents them sitting down
most activity recognition these days
there's not a lot of focus on doing
online recognition that has
as you're watching something happen the
idea is that they have the whole
sequence to begin with but if you're
actually are worried about recognizing
it as it happened this idea that I can't
recognize something till it's totally
done can be somewhat concerning you have
to think about how you might deal with
that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
