basic the basic statement we've been
using so far select star from links
let's add a where clause where votes are
greater than 10 that gives us only the
links that I've have I have a few votes
and let's add a new type of clause this
is the order by clause and this says to
sort the results
I've got select star from lengths we're
familiar with that where votes is
greater than 10 and we're familiar with
that additionally all of those rows that
you're returning to us order them by the
number of votes and by default the votes
are in ascending order but if you can't
remember that it's perfectly fine to
specify and you can say ASC 4 ascending
or de SC 4 descending and I usually
specify it because I can never remember
which is default pretty simple statement
now one thing one other thing to note is
that the where Clause is not required
it's never required so I could change
this to look like this just select star
from links ordered by votes descending
that would give me all of the links sort
of descending by votes with no
constraints whatsoever okay here's a
quiz so we're in the same file then
we're still manipulating our query
function and what I'd like you to do
this time is make the function query
return the IDS of the links that were
submitted by user 6 2 4 4 3 and sort
them by submission time ascending and
remember that a submission time is the
column called submitted underscore time
okay good luck</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
