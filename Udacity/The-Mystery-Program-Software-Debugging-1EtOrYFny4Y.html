for this unit will be statistical
debugging on a mystery program the idea
is that you get a mystery program and a
number of runs which pass or fail and
your job is to apply statistical
debugging to find out what is it in the
mystery program that causes the failures
however this time we're going to look at
another set of execution features that
is not lines executed but instead the
return values of individual functions
one of the outputs or your task could be
that the program fails whenever F
returns a value that's greater than zero
for this you need to track the return
values of individual functions and again
the Python tray set function will do
that for you the event is returned and
the return value is contained in the
argument plus you need to categorize the
returned values in multiple buckets I
want you to use precisely three
categories namely less than zero zero
and greater than zero for numerical
values this is straightforward depending
on the sign we put them into one of the
three categories but what for non
numerical values say lists or strings or
dictionaries or sets for the user you
compute the length if a string is empty
then it comes into the zero category if
it has one character or more then it
comes into the greater than zero
category same goes for sets no elements
one element or more lists and
dictionaries likewise the boolean values
false and true also going to 0 and
greater than zero since less than zero
is frequently used to indicate some
exceptional return value we're going to
use this category for special values
such as none not a number as well as for
exceptions that is if a function does
not return a value but raises an
exception instead then you categorize
this in the same way as a return value
that is less than zero what you then do
is for each function you compute the Phi
coefficient for each category as well as
for its respective complement what do I
mean by complement well let me
illustrate this with an example so again
you set up a table and count in how many
runs the function f returned a value
that was less than zero you do this for
the failing
as well as for the passing runs the
complement here of course is any value
that is greater or equal than 0 and
again you count the number of runs and
this is something you do for each
category for the zero category we check
whether the return value was 0 or
whether it was non zero and finally you
do the same for the third category
namely greater than zero now your task
will be to compute the Phi coefficients
for all functions and all categories as
well as their compliments and then to
find out for the mystery program which
is the one function whose return value
category correlates the strongest with
failure is your chance to apply
statistics to do the debugging and joy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
