start by defining bipartite graphs the
concept of matchings and some other
needed ideas then we'll show how the
problem of finding a maximum matching
can be reduced to the problem of finding
a maximum flow and this will give us an
e times V algorithm next we'll show that
the vertex cover problem is related to
the max matching problem much in the
same way that the minimum cut problem
was related to the max flow problem and
finally we'll give the Hopcroft carp
algorithm and show that it finds a
maximum matching in time order e times
the square root of V there are many good
references on the topic of maximum
matchings in bipartite graphs this
lesson will follow most closely climbing
Mugen tarnishes algorithm design for the
first three parts
and extra Cozens the design and analysis
of algorithms for the hop graph carpet
algorithm we begin our discussion by
defining the notion of a bipartite graph
an undirected graph is bipartite if
there exists partition into L and R
think left and right such that every
Edge has one vertex in L and one in R
for example this graph here is bipartite
I can label the green vertices as L and
the orange ones as R and then every Edge
has one vertex that's green and one
that's orange a few observations are on
order first saying that a graph is
bipartite is equivalent to saying that
it's too colorful for those of you who
are familiar with colorings next let's
take the same graph and add this edge
here to make it non bipartite note that
I've introduced an odd length cycle and
indeed saying that a graph is bipartite
is equivalent to saying that it has no
odd length cycles for graphs that aren't
connected it's possible that there will
be some ambiguity in the partition of
the vertices so sometimes the partition
is included in the definition and we
also you often draw the graphs with all
the vertices in one partition on the
left and all the vertices in the other
partition on the right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
