that we can fetch these instructions
then we rename them to eliminate false
dependencies so let's see whether we
have any false dependencies after
renaming and what does that do to our
IPC or instructions per cycle which is
the opposite of CPI well here we had a
true dependence and that true dependence
is still there in a rename program
similarly here we have a true dependence
and it is still there in a rename
program and then here we have another
one and it is still there however here
we also have an output dependence from
r2 here to r2 here and then another one
to here and we have an anti dependence
here and one here so if we look at all
of the dependencies then basically this
is a sequential program so for our first
program we have the CPI of 1 which is
also the IPC of 1 for a renamed program
however this anti dependence is no
longer there this output dependence is
no longer there there is no anti
dependence here and there is no output
dependence here so really here we can
execute this this and this instruction
in the first cycle and this this and
this instruction the second cycle so for
a rename program now we have that we can
execute this this and this instruction 3
instructions in the first cycle
these 3 can be done in the second cycles
so overall we have 6 instructions over 2
cycles the cycles per instruction is two
cycles for six instructions giving us a
much lower CPS only 0.33 or we can write
it as IPC of 3 meaning we execute 3
instructions per cycle as you can see
our renaming gave us a much better
potential for executing this program
quickly</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
