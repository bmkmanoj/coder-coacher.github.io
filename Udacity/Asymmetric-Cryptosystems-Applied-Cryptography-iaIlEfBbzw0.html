asymmetric cryptosystems we started
talking in unit 3 about the paper that
Diffie and Hellman wrote in 1976 then
introduced the idea of an asymmetric
cryptosystem they didn't figure out how
to build one quite yet they did figure
out that key exchange protocol that we
focused on in unit 3 what we'll do when
you're in a forest talk about the first
successful asymmetric cryptosystem which
is called RSA which is named for its
inventors Ron Rivest Adi Shamir and
Lenny Alvin will look at how asymmetric
cryptosystems can be used then we'll see
how RSA is constructed and we'll go in a
fair bit of detail of why RSA works and
why people believe it's secure and then
we'll look at some of the problems that
happen when people use RSA in practice
and finally we'll start talking about
applications of asymmetric cryptosystems
we won't get too far in applications
this unit but that'll be the main focus
of unit 5 all the crypto systems we've
talked about so far have been
symmetrical and what that means is that
the key used for encryption and the key
used for decryption are the same this
led to the problem that we talked about
in the previous unit about how do you
distribute this key between two parties
but even if you can solve that problem
using the same key for encryption as you
do for decryption limits what you can do
with a crypto system with an asymmetric
cryptosystem we have different keys for
encrypting and decrypting we'll call one
of those keys kayuu
the u stands for public and the other
key K R the R stands for private
unfortunately both public and private
start with the same letter P that's why
we use U n R to distinguish the two keys
public is a bit of a misnomer here what
we really mean is this key does not need
to be kept secret it's still very
important that it's generated in a
particular way and it's associated with
the right identity before we get into
the scheme for actually building a
crypto system like this and until one
was actually built it seems like this
really should be impossible if we reveal
the way we do encryption that seems like
we also reveal the inverse the way to do
decryption for the cipher to be correct
decryption must be the inverse of
encryption and for most functions when
to reveal how you compute the function
in one direction that also reveals how
to compute the inverse</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
