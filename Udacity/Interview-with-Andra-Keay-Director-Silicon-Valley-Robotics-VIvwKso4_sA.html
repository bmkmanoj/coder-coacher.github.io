explorers this week on human robot
interaction and robot ethics I'm here
with the director of Silicon Valley
robotics Andrew K Andrew how are you I'm
great
could be right can you tell me a little
bit about how you got started in
robotics I've always been a tech geek
but I went through a few different
pathways before coming back to robotics
and I say coming back to it I actually
did film and television technologies and
then computer and Internet technologies
and I felt that I was being behind the
curve so I thought what really is the
technology that is going to be the
biggest influence on the 21st century
and how do I make sure that that's the
technology that I'm involved with so I
went back to study robots and
particularly the areas around how robots
are going to how they're going to affect
society so I call it not just human
robot interaction but human robot
culture so the idea of like Cole BOTS
and things like that as well just kind
of everything working together in a nice
definitely looking at how things work
together but going beyond how robots may
work with us as individuals and starting
to ask the questions like will all taxi
drivers be out of jobs if we have
self-driving vehicles is that a fact or
will there be slower transitions what
does it mean if we make a change quickly
versus as we make a change in stages and
perhaps some of the things are you know
where do we make big wrong assumptions
about what a technology impact will be
and how can we make better assumptions
at predictions around what the impacts
of technologies will be because I think
most of the headlines that you hear or
read are completely wrong and in fact
one of my favorite sayings is Amara's
law which is that we greatly
overestimate the short-term impact of
the technology but we vastly
underestimate the long term impact and I
see robotics and the AI that's embodied
in robotics as
the fundamentally transformative
technologies of the 21st century but I
think we get really confused over what
are the short term and long term impacts
so when you talk about human robot
interaction it's not so much just a
robot that has a face that kind of walks
around and talks to people it's much
more than that
right I mean we're already talking about
taxi cabs and driver those cars so it's
really the idea of any type of
interaction with a robot from a human
perspective absolutely and you Ori you
raised one of those issues robot systems
and I think that a lot of HRI has
focused very much on psychological
studies of what happens between one
robot and one person but if you look at
commercialization and my goal my role
with Silicon Valley robotics has been to
help with the commercialization of a lot
of robotic startups and of course you're
trying to increase the spread of a
technology so you're not ever really in
a situation of talking about one robot
one person interactions you're talking
about multi interactions multiple robots
multiple people and you're talking about
things that need to include duration as
well so I felt that HRI is great as far
as it goes but for people to consider
that that is the only way to look at how
how we're going to interact with robots
is really missing many of the other
dimensions and durations you know
there's very little funding for things
like a long term study so there is one
particular one that studied people's
feelings about Roombas in their life
over a period of weeks rather than the
one-off kind of interaction and when you
did that it completely overturned a lot
of the papers that were saying people
respond this way to robots that do this
and people respond that way to robots
that do that and I thought to me that
captured exactly where we're going wrong
is we take these little snapshots and we
think that it's giving us
full panorama and it's not and that
that's common in a lot of studies that
you see actually right it's always
you're digging in to try to find that
one area but you're not really taking
the whole perspective of actually what's
going on
so you shoot in on that area and you say
ah this is the exact result that I was
looking for I set up the study in such a
way that I kind of forced my hand to be
able to get something like that but the
reality is like in the grand scheme of
things or a longer-term study you'll
realize that it's actually quite the
opposite mmm well I think robotics is
very flawed in not being a science it's
an engineering discipline and most
papers are not reproduce about and I'm
talking well beyond HRI
it's really every area this was one of
the things that Willow Garage was very
strongly about changing that paradigm by
creating a a common robotics platform
and then a common robotics operating
system so you had a greater chance of
being able to take somebody else's
research and replicate it and ideally
get the same results and that's been
pretty much lacking in the field of
robotics for those people who don't know
Willow Garage is also the creators of
Ross which is why they used platform for
pretty much any robotics company that's
starting within the last 10 years or so
absolutely it's now I think in the last
five years it's gone from being used by
companies that knew Willow Garage to
being used by pretty much every startup
that I'm in contact with and it may not
be being used at their commercial
release level but it's being used in the
development stages at the very least so
kind of going back to the idea of HRI
what do you consider in your opinion
what makes a good robot that interacts
with a human I think that one of the key
things is don't over specialize don't
over a dorm don't make your robot really
promise more than it's going to be able
to deliver because I think we still have
very very rudimentary abilities to
behave appropriately in context and as
long as you can't really rely on a robot
to know enough about a situation to have
anything approaching a human level of
response then creating something that
gives us the expectation is going to you
know it's going to turn around and bite
us because people will be disappointed
in that robot and we're at a weird point
right now where there are a lot of
claims so it's probably easier to sell a
robot if you make a lot of promises
about what it can do and people love the
idea of robots that they can have some
sort of relationship in a very broad
sense companionship it's cute something
like that but it makes it easier to sell
the robot but we haven't really had
enough robots out there for people to
start to see how well they remain
engaged and I think most good robotics
companies are actually less concerned
with selling the robot and more
concerned with building something that
is going to keep engagement once it has
been so once it's in someone's house how
do you keep people interacting with it
so it's an interesting idea talking
about the engagement level of a robot do
you feel that there's certain types of
robots that warrant a higher level of
engagement and like a stronger bond
between people so for instance you know
government contractors I used to work in
ground control stations for UAVs and
things like that but I read an article
that one of the soldiers had a UAV that
he flew on a bunch of different missions
in Afghanistan or Iraq and it was I
think 15 missions or something like that
and it got shot down finally and when it
got shot down the soldier demanded a
burial for his UAV and they were like
what's just a robot he's like this thing
has saved my life so many times you know
with all of the landmines IDs and
everything else out there he's like I
want this thing buried I want to have a
percent off for it do you think you're
gonna see that kind of reaction for more
people kind of going forward in the
future with like social robots or home
robots or do you think it's just going
to be kind of one of those it's kind of
a cool thing I interact with it a little
bit but then after a while like kind of
like this new and shininess of it kind
of wears off and we actually go back to
treating it more like a machine I think
it really depends on the depth of the
interaction and you've talked about
what's really an extreme use case it's
been engaged in life-and-death
situations so you will have a very
strong bond if it's vacuuming your
floors
you won't and one of the points that has
been raised that I think was very
interesting was to suggest that up until
this moment in time humans really had
only a couple of ontological states that
we could comprehend one was alive and
one was dead or inanimate so you were
either an object or you were an organism
and it's saying so do we then get into a
kind of side state of having things
that behave or that we treat like
organisms that then behave like objects
and do we then treat them like objects
or do we carry over that more emotional
response and what does that mean in
terms of us developing perhaps empathy
there's one of the biggest worries that
people have if we're engaging with
something that looks like it's alive but
we can treat it badly
is this going to create a lack of
empathy in us one of the interesting
hypotheses is that we're going to evolve
towards a third ontological awareness
that there are some things that are both
alive and not alive that they can be
emotionally engaging but they can be
turned off and on at will without damage
so if we can really develop that third
ontological awareness then perhaps
there's not an issue with
being trained into a lack of empathy
because we all understand that it's that
thing as opposed to an it or a you so
it's an interesting idea right when you
start talking about it can interact with
the person than the person could relate
to it but we can always turn off a
switch yeah when you're dealing with
something like that is there ever a
point where you start looking at it from
the other perspective of like wow this
thing actually has feelings and emotions
right so we've seen videos I'm sure
you've seen them a well of Boston
Dynamics it's big dog where people have
you know the engineers have shown
kicking this this robot right and having
it scuffled generally most drink oh oh
when they see that exactly it encourages
that however one of the things I've also
seen is that people that are more
familiar with robots don't have quite
that shocked pity feeling so they've
become much more used to what they're
seeing and they'll have a different
level of response and I think it comes
back down to saying you know don't
confuse the snapshot for the whole
picture one of the I've got five what I
call laws of robotics because we all
have a smarts laws of robotics even
though they don't work they never going
to work and even though I think laws is
the wrong really the wrong terminology
to use I think to be effective laws kind
of come later
what we really want to be talking about
is design guidelines suggestions that
can educate and inform people towards
better decisions at the earliest
possible stages of building robots but I
call them five laws of robotics and they
start really at the most critical level
in terms of Maslow's hierarchy of needs
which is don't build killing machines
and while drones in warfare maybe they
are currently accepted but they have
less they're a bit of a mix they're
informational they can do other things
they're not necessarily weapons
I think the key concept there is if you
build something that is nothing but a
killing machine then it's very difficult
to have some other purpose for it
so the key principle is always build a
multi-purpose robot not something that
is purely evil and then the next one
down is build things that obey laws and
it might seem obvious but there are some
really clear areas like does this robot
breach privacy law and are you aware of
what privacy law in different countries
is so when you're putting sensors onto
something are they going to be
law-abiding or not and we do start to
run into issues where you have a lot of
sensors of required for autonomous
vehicles for mobile robots and they're
going to start to be traveling in areas
where there can be unpredicted data
breaches privacy breaches surveillance
issues so can you think through these
things ahead of time those laws exist
because there is a social standard that
we've come to agree on so you have to
inform yourself as to why they exist and
how what you build might end up putting
you on the wrong side of those things
ultimately the other laws relate to
building things that don't create the
wrong expectation so build a robot
system that is as transparent as
possible so that you understand as much
as possible about what its intentions
are and what its capabilities are what
it's able to do and for me that is you
know don't be deceptive and don't build
deceptive robots a robot that's humanoid
is going to create the impression in
us that it is capable of humanoid level
behaviors and the reality is that it's
not you know but we're going to think
that it can remember us from time to
time we're going to think that if it
uses emotional hand gestures that it's
going to be able to understand our
emotional state that it will understand
things like proximity and body space so
you get into a lot of trouble because at
the moment we don't really have that
level of understanding or intelligence
so I think that there are reasons for
building robots that can have a good
social interaction but at the moment I
think you need to keep them in a very
narrow domain so that you don't start to
imagine you've got a general purpose
friend no what you have is a very
helpful assistant driver or a very
helpful medicine cabinet teacher you
don't have a friend or something else
and within that there are also other
areas around transparency which relate
to is it possible for other people to
understand how something is making its
decisions and how its operating which
comes down to you know algorithmic
transparency as well we're incorporating
a lot of black boxes into what we do and
I know that's probably a problem that
you've covered elsewhere so ultimately
from that is avoid black boxes and avoid
over featuring a robot you know don't be
humanoid if you don't need to be saw the
best robots ones like same a field
robotics Kure it doesn't have a screen
it doesn't have a lot of features it
acts more like a toy than a humanoid it
makes sure that you can appreciate its
limits much more and I think also
Gedaliah Health's Madu
and
something that I see in the best robot
designs they focus on can you do what
you do well rather than trying to do
everything and ultimately there's one
final guideline is can we tell who is
responsible for a robot who owns it do
we have any kind of idea about
registration license plates for robots
or something else like that because you
are definitely already seeing robots in
public places and the westfield shopping
malls for example in the streets of
redwood city delivering food and san
francisco streets settles tariffs for us
and as a airport now who is having that
interaction with you right is it the
robot or is it you know the person whose
program
well the robots at the front of that
right but is that an interaction on
behalf of San Jose Airport or is it an
interaction on behalf of the third-party
who is using the space at San Jose
Airport who do you contact if that robot
runs over your toddler's toes okay all
of these things but the physical
potential harm and the economic and
emotional potential harm that can happen
in these situations you need to be able
to say whose robot is that and I foresee
a time coming up very soon where we have
a lot of robots engaged in advertising
and sales not just delivery and as such
it's not hard to create something that
gives us the illusion of that can
capture our attention ok you know a
billboard even if it's a moving
billboard it's not going to capture our
attention anywhere near as much as a
humanoid object that can also use some
movement and some other visual cues to
capture our attention because ultimately
we're still chimpanzees in terms of our
responses there are certain things that
will trigger our responses then what is
the purpose
the robot is probably there to be
conducting business of some kind and are
you going to be as informed and as in
charge of that relationship as you would
be if it was a person saying would you
like to have a free sample of this and
would you like to come into the shop and
try this on or all of those other things
that we're used to humans saying and
we're used to ignoring or we're used to
being able to assess who they are what
they're doing and why they're doing it
so that for me is the last area of real
transparency where the license plates
and where's the chain of responsibility
and how do we have access to it so
talking about the interaction that
you're having with some of these robots
do you feel that the human biases of the
people who are who are building
designing these robots are actually
impacting the kind of interaction we're
having with it on the other end yeah I
think initially we had robots that were
being built to the how would you say to
the biases and desires and imagination
of the robot builders and also to the
limitations of the form factor around
certain things so some robots came out
looking female simply because you needed
to have a wider hip base to incorporate
whatever the mechanisms being used were
and other robots came out looking
something different so we started off
with purely physical mechanical
limitations but then they became
creatures of the imagination and what's
worrisome is that that starts to
perpetuate biases and stereotypes
now just as quickly as people start to
become more informed and be looking at
good design I think we also have a
negative pressure from businesses who
can already quantify our responses to
merchandising and start to use certain
genders voices and appearances based on
what they've assessed is going to give
us the most
accurate the best rigor the best rigor
exactly and one of the things that
someone's brought up is you know where
where are the black robots so you
already have lack of representation but
I think the lack of representation is
going to continue in really bad ways
someone has expressed it really nicely
and they've said that stereotypes are
not a problem because they're false
they're a problem because they're only
one of the truths and whenever you use
the stereotype you ignore all of the
other truths and so when we use those
stereotype robots we're forcing a
convergence on a very narrow set of
representations that may be true and may
be effective but are going to do away
with having any of the other true
representations can be very off-putting
for a lot of people too right if you're
not admitting that target demographic
you're gonna feel like I don't relate I
don't like the way that this thing is
you know portraying itself to me it's
very off-putting - right we're going to
see some very clear things around say
one of the things that I've been
tracking is the use of gendered
stereotypes in work positions so kiosk
robots are tending to being female
assistant robots female authoritative
robots male now how do women break
through the glass ceiling if we are
creating a robotic Lea amplified world
in which women are the assistants and
service providers rather than the
executives or leaders or people with the
voice of authority this will be sending
us a few steps backwards and we won't
even see it coming
yet so it's a really interesting concept
right when you hear people gender izing
there
robots because you see it from time to
time when someone say well oh he's a
good robot or she's a good robot and I
never quite understood why you would do
something like that because really get
the end of the day the robots not a
person right the robot has no feelings
the robot has is just algorithms and
sensors that are meant to work together
to provide some sort of an experience
whatever that may be so I prefer to call
a robot and it yes or that or that they
I think what would sure yeah absolutely
I try very hard to always call them it I
actually think that we should go ahead
and develop a third set of pronouns
similar to that third ontological
awareness out of respect for what they
are and also to help us see them as the
artificial embodied intelligences that a
robot is so I think we should first off
this comes to over featuring a robot
anything that adds trappings of gender
should not be there I really believe
that we can create non-gendered asexual
robots and we can utilize a new way of
referring to them and that ultimately
would be the safest thing for us as a
society looking at some of the robots
and the interactions that we have with
them right now right there's a lot of
robots that you're starting to see move
into factories right so there's there
were the factories that we had of the
past which we're basically just gigantic
robot arms and no humans were
interacting but now we're starting to
see you know other companies like
rethink robotics is a great example
right but there Baxter a robot where
they're kind of showing hey this robot
you know coexist and works along side a
human in a certain environment it seems
like that reaction is kind of mixed from
a lot of people right in these factories
where it's like it's great that this
robots helping me out but how long
before this robot kind of comes over and
takes over my job do you think that
we're going to get to a point where
humans are going to be replaced by
robots and factories
altogether or do you think there's
always going to be some level of
existence of coexistence with a human
and a robot and a factory working
together I believe that robots are
always going to augment us rather than
replace us and I think at the moment the
best thing to do is to say that robots
take tasks not jobs but I would like to
see factories that don't have people in
them I think it's an inhuman job it is
the epitome of robotic labor you know I
don't believe that that is a job that
feeds human need for social interaction
or creativity or any of the things that
we like I think if people didn't need
the money they wouldn't voluntarily go
to work in a factory and I think we have
an opportunity to look at our world our
life our economy our society and say we
have an opportunity to remake everything
what are the things that people
shouldn't be doing and they should not
be doing a lot of the dull dirty
dangerous jobs and it's one of the most
striking arguments for autonomous
vehicles is to reduce death on the roads
you know automobile accidents are one of
the greatest costs for of human lives in
in most societies these days so that's
definitely a reason to look at having
autonomous vehicles which will have a
much better safety record as long as
we've got them to the point where
they've definitely going to have and I
think you need to be at a much greater
safety level than a human behind the
wheel because we accept a certain amount
of risk from human behavior we will not
accept that exact same amount of risk
from robot behavior robots have to be
significantly I think an order of
magnitude better before we're going to
want to wholesale the drop them into
certain areas but we shouldn't be mining
underground directly
those that's one of the most deadly jobs
imaginable going into space is also
deadly I mean I definitely want to go to
Mars but I don't want to spend unneeded
amounts of time in space preparing
habitats and building rockets and doing
things that have huge exposure to
radiation so I think there's a whole
class of jobs that we ought to automate
completely as fast as possible but every
single robot that's out there needs to
be built it needs to be programmed and
it needs to be managed and I think we're
going to have a huge class of employment
that relates to looking after and
training robots and it's going to range
from the highly skilled you know more
algorithmic jobs down to ones that are
much more physical like oh it's missed
plugging itself in down on aisle 4 let's
go and walk along and make sure that
they've all got good contacts to charge
up and while we're at it let's you know
tidy that one up and we're slated to do
some routine maintenance you know let's
do these kind of things you know I see
robots and looking after robots will in
many ways take the place that the
automobile has had over the last century
so we've seen one transition where a
huge chunk of human society used to be
involved in looking after horses and
then they transition to looking after
automobiles and I think there's going to
be another transition to looking after
the broader range let's say I call a car
a robot and it's just going to be many
more engine you think they'll just be
more specialized in the sensitive so for
instance like as you have a mechanic now
you might have somebody who works on you
know bipedal robots only or somebody who
works on air vehicles only you think
that's going to be kind of like the
emergence of new jobs of like well
you're trained technically to do kind of
all of them but you're really going to
be focused on one area or one brand or
one manufacturer oh definitely you're
going to have really infinite scope for
specialization
and ideally it won't be manufacturer
specific because I think one of the
things holding robotics back is lack of
some of the common standards and
platforms that you're going to need to
have so you know we see this in very
small scale with the importance of Ross
and with things like the importance of a
common standard for end effectors on the
end of robot arms so it doesn't really
matter whether it's a fan okay I'm a
cougar arm or a universal robotics arm
or a soya from rethink robotics those
range of end effectors will all be able
to be used on it but where are some of
the other things that we're still
developing
perhaps multi robot communication
protocols and so forth yes maybe just
using the internet but what about in
other situations I think we're going to
see more common standards emerge we'll
have to but I think your specification
will relate to form factor and will
relate to industries so let's say a
bipedal robot that does something on
farms is going to be a vastly different
bipedal robot to one that is doing
something in clothing stores sure so I
also think that there is a huge scope
for creative employment one of the jobs
that you do with social robotics is
write script and you know look at how
health is a great example of that half
their staff is basically writers and
psychologists yes and companies like
Anki and many of the others half of
their staff are game designers and
visual illustrators and I think also
people who are dance and theater people
because you're you're having to teach
and create the appropriate behaviors in
whatever the narrow area is then you
have to have done main expertise who
understand you know what is important in
a robot that has an interaction with you
for the purposes of understanding your
health needs and how different is that
to a robot that is going to interact
with you in a clothing store
and it's highly specialized but
completely different modes of behavior
and background knowledge required but we
underestimate the sheer physical I mean
robots it if anyone can remember the
very early days of the automobile and I
personally can't but they were all a
little different and they all didn't
work most of the time more or less
so just physically looking after them
sometimes the biggest thing we forget
when we talk about robots entering the
world is that they're going to be
physical and it might be like I said as
simple as putting it back on to charge
properly it might be moving something
out of the way because it stopped
working and maybe there is something
blocking it so you can't tell you're
eight it out of the way there's going to
be a heap of teleoperation and one of
the big ways in which I think we need to
interact with where robots and humans
will work together has to do with that
remote operation so I see a future where
the robot can tell you where to find
things on aisle four and offer to show
you the way but when you ask it if they
think that this brand is better than
that brand that immediately goes to the
human operator right because they're
wrong why don't you to shampoo or
something Oh or necessarily have the
ability to ask the right questions to
understand who is it for what is the
this or the perhaps just the trust level
that we that we would have from an
interaction with the person DARPA has
modified a dragonfly to put on a
backpack on to this this insect which
basically controls its nervous system so
they can actually monitor and move the
actual biological beam in the way that
they choose is this something that we
should be kind of playing around with
still or is this something that at this
point in our technology that we feel
like you know what we really don't need
as many biologically
creative animals as possible we really
should start focusing more on just
purely robots or should be kind of there
or is this kind of like a necessary
hurdle that we have to get over I mean
we see a lot with animal testing with
makeup products and things like that but
yeah from a robot perspective in my
opinion it's slightly concerning right
because you're starting to say well
we're just going to hijack this host and
we're going to have this host do
whatever we want it to do even though
it's its own physical being or entity of
some form there was a lot of outcry over
the crowdfunding campaign for you know
do-it-yourself mouse or rat brain
hacking chips or cockroach cockroach
hacking there are several interesting
ethical dilemmas and elements in there
when I see the fruits of this research
being used to allow someone to use an
embedded chip to move a prosthetic arm
when they've had no movement then I
think it's a good thing especially when
I put it into the context of realizing
that we still do incredible amount of
research on animals
you know we for cosmetics as you said
for reasons that seem far less
compelling but we kill a lot of animals
and we torture a lot of animals for many
reasons already what's the real
difference between putting chips in and
remote-controlling them but it raises a
couple of issues one is what's the end
goal of this and I think the reality is
we're starting to produce some very
small flying robots nowhere near is
fuel-efficient as your average insect or
bird but we're improving technologies
all the time so I think you can see a
future where we don't need to talk about
it being a hijacked organism it's purely
a robotic miniature surveillance device
is that okay for us to use something
that most people might not be aware of
and why would we do that and one of the
reasons for doing a lot of biomorphic
work in robotics is this interesting
two-way street which we learn so much
more about how biology works when we try
to build artificial systems to imitate
it and vice versa we then learn so much
more about how physical robotic
mechanical and electrical systems work
when we try to replicate how the
organisms work so robotics feeds our
understanding of biology which then
feeds our understanding of robotics and
this kind of feedback loop goes all the
way back to gray Walters tortoises in
the 50s and he was a brain scientist and
he built the first autonomous mobile
robots analog and they were like
following robots and they displayed a
very lifelike behavior simply through
you know phototropic behaviors and what
inspired him was creating a physical
modeling of the workings of the neurons
in the brain so there is there's one
thing I do want to talk about because
it's always this doom and gloom issue as
you and I are both aware right is the
idea that robots are taking all of our
jobs everywhere you look it seems like
lately there's another article that's
popping up and saying robots are going
to take all of our jobs by 2030 you know
80% of the jobs in the US are going to
be automated factory farm workers are
going to be out of their jobs in the
next two years right like it's always to
this level of like it's here and it's
happening now and everything is going
away and in time to go grab you know
your pitchforks and rise up against the
robots before everything goes doom and
gloom what are your thoughts on kind of
this you know portrayal in the media
that you know robots are here to take
everything away from people and people
aren't going to be able to afford you
know a life for their families then
there's this concept of you know
taxation on top of these robots okay
the bonfire the robots issue it is so
completely wrong
anybody who's developed robots has a
much greater appreciation of just how
far behind that state we are I believe
there is still fewer than two million
industrial robots in the world global
total today and that's with China
putting a huge amount of money into it
so that there now have this year become
I think the world's largest producer of
robots as well as the world's largest
consumer of robots pushing Germany out
of the top spot and yet the sum total
two million okay
it's going to take quite a while for us
to spread sophisticated robotics
technology around the globe and then I
think the other thing is to look at
certain industries and you mentioned
farm workers if you were to mention that
in an agricultural area you would have
everybody that owned a farm saying can I
have some of those because I can't get
enough workers and to look at the labor
statistics almost every country in the
world has an ageing population problem
and it is worst in rural occupations so
you're pretty much going to have every
farmer in the world retiring in the next
five to ten years and at the same time
we're shutting down all of the cheap
labor sources and seasonal labor sources
that used to be so how are we going to
prevent the world from starving and yet
keep food prices you know at the level
that we expect them to be and you know
we really do have to look at doubling
food production over the next generation
not just keeping things as they are
either so I see some huge areas where we
actually have big problems we have
global challenges that we need to do
something about so whenever people talk
about robots as a problem I stop and I
go well what are the world's biggest
problems and will robotics have a role
to play in solving fixing or you know
making those problems a little bit
better
and I think absolutely yes and if anyone
is on the fence then focus on the ways
that we need to solve these problems and
think about the creative technologies
that we have to put into play to fix
global challenges and I think that's the
most productive thing you can do with
your time rather than to you know spend
it worried or or in fear which first off
I don't think is founded but second off
if you got that energy there is a lot of
good things that you can do so focus on
those and yeah and and not on that fear
well that's it for today and you'd ask
these explorers human robot interaction
and robotic ethics on drew kay thank you
very much for your time we appreciate it
thanks so much Mike</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
