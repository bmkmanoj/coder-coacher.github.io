check for one quiz but I don't think
it's that hard to think about so let's
go through this in a creek each node is
connected to each of the other nodes so
the degree is linear in the number of
nodes but think about path length since
every node is connected to every other
node so the paths you can always get
directly from one node to any other node
very very small world but it's a small
world because everybody knows everybody
and we know that that's not what our
world is like though if you go to a
small private school you might have
exhibited exactly this kind of effect
all right next let's think about a ring
what happens in a ring well the degree
in a ring is always to all the nodes
have degree too so it's constant degree
but what about a path length what's the
longest path length in a ring well some
of the nodes are really nearby but some
of them you have to go all the way to
the other side to get to them and that
could be as big as the number of nodes n
divided by 2 because it's the opposite
side after it you get further and
further and further you start to get
closer again so the path length is
actually linear in this case balanced
trees are really interesting so the
degree here while a node might have a
parent and two children this is a
balanced binary tree in particular the
root node has a degree of two and all
the leaves have a degree of one so it's
never more than three no matter how many
nodes are in the graph so the degree is
constant but let's look at the path
length any node can get to any other
node by going up to the root and then
back down to the other node you want to
get to getting up to the route takes
logarithmically than many steps and then
going back down also takes logarithmic
lean too many steps so it's like to log
in so that's actually a pretty short
path for big graph it's not that many
hops you have to make to get to where
you're going all right finally let's
look at our friend the hypercube in a
hypercube each node is numbered with log
in bits and it's connected to all the
other nodes in the network that have
names that differ by at most one bit
there's it most logarithmically many of
those so each node in a hyper cube
is connected to log in other nodes the
degree is big theta of log in now what
about path length if I want to get from
one node to any other node what do I
need to do so we didn't talk about this
before but it's actually kind of neat so
let's imagine we want to get from some
node and here's its label 010 to some
other node and here's its label 111 we
know in one hop we can go from 0 1 0 to
1 10 and then in one more hop we can go
from 1 10 to 1 11 in fact to go from any
node in a hypercube to any other node in
a hypercube all you have to do is go
through the bit positions one at a time
and traverse the corresponding edge if
the source and the target differ in that
bit position so in most log in hops we
can go from any position in this
hypercube to any other position so again
pretty short paths</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
