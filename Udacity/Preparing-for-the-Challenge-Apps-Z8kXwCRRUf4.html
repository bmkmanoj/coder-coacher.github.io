delegates the challenge app for this
lesson has three text fields with
customized behavior zip code text field
that only allows digits with a maximum
of five digits a dollar sign text field
that begins with the text 40 cents and
then fills in the dollar figure as
digits are added and finally a text
field that can only be edited when this
switch is set to on here in the first
field once i get to five digits i can't
type anymore here in the second field
the digits fill in from right to left
and there are always two digits beyond
the decimal by the way don't forget that
command K toggles the keyboard in the
third field the user has to flip this
switch in order to add text you can see
that tapping inside the first two fields
brings up the number pad instead of the
QWERTY keyboard you can set this in the
attribute inspector in storyboard
actually let's open up the utilities
pain and take a minute to explore the
attribute inspector this is a super
convenient way to configure uikit view
components here you can set your place
holder text so you might want to put
something like type your zip code here
here you can configure the Clear button
like the one you saw in the Safari
search bar here you can set
capitalization if you had something like
a confirmation code you might want all
characters to be capitalized and here's
the keyboard type which for the zip code
we want set to number pad and just two
more tips before you move on to the
challenge you're going to need to set
the delegates for your text fields if
you want to do this in storyboard
remember your delegate is just a
property so you're going to look for it
in storyboard where you always look for
properties in the pop-up connections
menu and here under outlets you can see
your delegate also for manipulating text
you might want to revisit these two
lines of code from the emoji text field
delegate the NS string class has a
method named string by replacing
characters in range it's perfect to use
in a uitextfield delegate this method is
helpful when you need to build new
strings from typed input in order to use
this method swift strings are usually
cast to NS strings in this case the
variable new text represents the text
that will be displayed</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
