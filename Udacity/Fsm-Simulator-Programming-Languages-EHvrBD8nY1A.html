our finite state machine in Python here
I've redrawn our finite state machine
for a plus 1 plus and we said before
that we were going to make the edges a
mapping or a dictionary well one of our
edges is that state 1 on a state 1 on
input a goes to state 2 and another one
is that state 2 on a stays in state 2
that's our self loop if we are on state
2 when we see a 1 we go to state 3 and
state 3 and 1 stays the same let me just
highlight one of these this particular
edge from 2 to 3 on a 1 corresponds to
this entry in our edges mapping I also
need to know which states are the
accepting States previously I'd denoted
that by drawing double lines but again
we can't pass the picture into Python so
I'll just make a list of all the things
that accept and actually that's it you
think we need a list of the nodes but
you're gonna see that we're actually
able to finesse it because all the nodes
we really care about already appear in
this edges listing so here we are
writing our finite state machine
simulator and this is actually super
exciting because it previews one of the
concepts that we're gonna have later in
the course
interpreting another program this is
like the junior grade version of it even
this will be a lot of fun so together
we're going to write a procedure called
FSM sim for FSM simulation finite state
machine simulator you pass in the input
string the start state of the current
state the edges and the accepting States
and it returns true if that string is
accepted by the finite state machine and
false otherwise we'll do it together
submit via the interpreter I'll write
the first half of this procedure with
you so let's get started on our finite
state machine simulation quiz here I'm
just recopy engaging so that we'll have
a test input to work with and these to
the edges in the accepting state
correspond to the regular expression a
plus 1 plus and now we're going to
define our procedure finite state
machine simulator given a string the
current state the edges these ones up
here in the accepting state what do we
do well one possibility is that we're
already at the end of the input at which
point we should just check to see if our
current state is annexed
ding state or not if we're at the end of
the input and we are state 3 then we
return true otherwise we should be
returning false if the string isn't
empty then I can get the current letter
as the 0th position from the string and
now here's your part we know the current
input letter we're looking at the
current state were in all of the edges
are available to us you fill out the
rest of this code here's a hint find out
if there's a valid edge leaving from
this state on this letter if there is
you should take that edge and keep
walking if there is not we fall off the
end of the finite state machine and die
so you should return false and the big
hint for you is recursion which is
always the hint in computer science
because it's the secret of all power
knowledge in the universe recursion use
it oh and I can't even spell it
recursion you should use it and spell it
correctly unlike me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
