another famous thought exercise in
computer science here we have a
theoretical knapsack with a limited
weight capacity and more items than can
possibly fit in it each item has a
weight and a value the question here is
how can i optimize the total value of
items in my knapsack
given the weight constraint will focus
on the zero-one knapsack problem where
you only have one of each object and you
must either take or leave a whole object
in some other variants you can take a
fraction of an object when I heard about
this problem my first thought was just
put the object with the highest values
in first
but what if putting the two elements
with the highest values hit the weight
limit but putting all the other elements
in together would actually fit and have
a higher value there aren't a lot of
actual knapsacks in computer science but
this problem describes an optimization
issue that crops up often before
devising the best solution particularly
if you're stuck it can be helpful to
think of the solution that's slow but
straightforward here we could try every
combination of objects and just pick the
one that's best also called the brute
force solution the runtime of this
solution is on the order of 2 raised to
the n where n is the number of objects
there are actually 2 to the N possible
combinations there's a precise
mathematical reason for this but you
could also think of one combination as a
string of length n where each spot has a
1 if it's in the knapsack or a 0 if it's
left out that means this is an
exponential time algorithm since the N
is an exponent we would prefer a
polynomial time algorithm where the N is
multiplied by something else or has a
constant number for an exponent which is
going to be much faster for large
numbers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
