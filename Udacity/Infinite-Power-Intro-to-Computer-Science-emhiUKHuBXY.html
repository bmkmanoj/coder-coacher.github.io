six is recursive definitions and we'll
see how to use a recursive definition of
popularity to make the search engine
respond with the best page for a given
query instead of just giving us all the
pages this is really a key advance that
made Google so successful the real goal
of this unit is to give you infinite
power I know what you're thinking I have
infinite power already and you're right
you've had infinite power since unit two
when you learned about procedures than
if and that was enough to write every
possible computer program but we went on
to introduce while to use a while loop
to find all the links in a page and that
really should not have been necessary if
you already had infinite power
you wouldn't have needed anything new to
do that what we're gonna see in this
unit is that you could do that with that
while that all you really need is
procedures and by thinking about things
recursively you can solve lots of
problems in interesting ways</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
