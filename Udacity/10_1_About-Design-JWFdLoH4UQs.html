I wanted to pause to check back in with
Roman Nurik at our design center in new
york city talk a bit more about design
roman once again thanks for your time do
you think that every mobile app
developer should strive to become a
designer well I don't think it's
necessarily important for every
developer to become a designer and stop
doing their engineering work I do think
though that every developer every front
end developer should have some sense of
design and I also think that really your
as a mobile developer you're already
doing design work right whether you like
it or not you are creating your crafting
the experience for the end user and so
what I think is important is just
knowing that this is something that this
is a something you're participating in
this is not something that is being
handed to you and you're just executing
on knowing that this is something you're
participating in I think it's super
important for developers to really kind
of study up on it to to get as good as
possible at kind of you know observing
the differences observing you know the
little details and really kind of caring
about every little I hate saying every
little pixel but every little decision
here and there and so I think rather
than saying every developer should
become a designer I think every
developer should really understand
design always understanding also that
you're going to be working at a team and
kind of understanding what your
designers are good at and so forth so
yes in short for me that's super
interesting and you can definitely see
how we're using material in our
cross-platform experiences here at
Google all being true in many ways to
the unique element of each platform
design has become so much more important
in building applications of all sorts
that I think it's really important for
every engineer to at least be familiar
with the palette of options available to
them and through their designers to that
end Roman Nurik Nick butcher and James
Williams are developing a terrific
course in material design that any
front-end engineer should experience</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
