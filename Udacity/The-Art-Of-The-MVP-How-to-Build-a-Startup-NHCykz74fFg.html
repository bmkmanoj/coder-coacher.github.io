channels there's an art to building a
Minimum Viable Product just think about
this an MVP is not a minimal product an
MVP is not like well we only have three
weeks so we cut off the feature list
here that's not what an MVP is an MVP is
based on interaction and iteration in
understanding customers needs and pains
and gains and if all you're doing is
cutting off the feature list then you
clearly haven't run the process
sometimes we get but my customers really
don't know what they want I'm creating
something so new getting out of the
building is just a waste of time because
if I show up my solution they're not
even going to know what planet I'm
talking about we're gonna be talking
about the problem of market type in a
subsequent lecture but there's a case
called the new market where your right
customers have never seen an iPhone
before or never seen a new product
before in that case you still want to
get out of the building but instead of
asking them about features you actually
want to understand how are they spending
their time now and what solutions are
they using to solve their pains and
gains and so we'll talk about market
type later but but when you hear people
say but my customers don't know what
they want just Park that for a while
because that's not an excuse to stay in
the building and keep adding features</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
