affect IQ identical twins share a
hundred percent of their genetic makeup
they're genetically identical paternal
twins share only 50% of their genetic
makeup this is also true for siblings
and parents so you share 50% of your
genetic makeup with each one of your
parents so 50% with your mom
and 50% with your dad and you share 25%
of your genetic makeup with your
grandparents aunts uncles nieces and
nephews and people you're not related to
well you guessed it you share 0% of your
genetic makeup with it so we can turn
these percentages into numbers ranging
from 0 not related to 1 being identical
twins this is called genetic relatedness
now environment has two very - typically
biological parents and children live in
the same household but that doesn't
necessarily mean they have the exact
same environment but it is very similar
now of course there's also cases where
biological parents and siblings are
raised completely separate from each
other for example when people are
adopted now let's look at a graph to
show how IQ is related to different
types of nature and nurture
here are IQ correlations remember 0 1 2
3 not very good they're not really
related but high correlations mean
they're really similar and here we'll
see if they share an environment or not
meaning if they live together or if they
don't so first let's look at identical
twins they have a 1 on genetic
relatedness here we can see that
identical twins who are raised together
have a point 8 5 correlation between IQ
scores so because they're genetically
identical and they were raised in the
same environment their IQ scores are
really similar but we know nature
matters because identical twins who also
have a 1 in genetic relatedness because
they're genetically identical but were
raised apart so they didn't share the
same environment have a point 7 5 IQ
correlation meaning they're still really
similar but not as close as if they were
to live together now let's look at
genetic relatedness of 0.5 meaning
50% of your genetic makeup so fraternal
twins share 50% of their genetic makeup
those who are raised together so they
shared an environment have a correlation
of about 0.6 so that's pretty related
however if they're raised apart it goes
just below point 4 showing that
environment does play a big factor in IQ
siblings again who you share 50% of your
makeup with those who are raised
together with a shared environment have
just below 0.5 correlation so it's not
very related however if the siblings
were raised apart so they didn't share
an environment this significantly drops
to just above 0.2 which is a really low
correlation and parents who raise their
children so sharing an environment with
them again had less than a point 5
correlation however when they didn't
share an environment again it drops to
about a point to these show the
importance of environment now let's look
at adoption so these people have zero
genetic relatedness but they share the
same environment so adopted siblings are
just above 0.3 in their IQ correlation
an adoptive parents are just below a
point - in their correlation even though
they shared the same environment they
didn't have a very strong correlation
among IQ scores that shows us that
genetics are an important factor to the
formal conclusion of these studies says
about 50% of the differences between
people's intelligence is due to genetic
influence and about 40% is due to
environmental effects that leaves 10%
being unexplained so we just don't know
