layout it's time to get this done we
have two problems first if you've tried
this on a nexus 7 or other 7-inch tablet
there's a good chance the detail view
isn't rendering in landscape mode the
reason for this is that the grid view
cannot solve for the constraints we've
given it and the reason why we don't
have enough room is at the design for
this you calls for the toolbar to be
placed in line with a detail grid rather
than above it the second problem is a
problem of elevation our design calls
for a shadow around our detail view but
it's just not there since we'd like this
to have a shadow on all platforms not
just Android L we can introduce another
widget from the support library card
view card view is a container that casts
a shadow round of you when we change the
elevation of the card it casts a larger
shadow note that card view has its own
version of the elevation parameter we
can also change the radius of the
corners of the card view to make rounded
shadowed rectangles note that this works
best on L due to the way we handle
clipping on the compatible version
because the card you is a layout that
draws stuff around other layouts it
works a bit differently than others you
can control the background color of the
layout the background color of the card
the padding around the card frame and
the padding inside the card frame
between the card and its contents since
card use rendered in Android L using
elevation it's important to understand
how this impacts the rendering of views
first of all a view at a higher
elevation obscures views at lower
elevations if you have nested views if a
view will obscure the parent it will
also obscure all children of the view
views that have transparent backgrounds
don't cast shadows views that are
contained within these transparent views
will also not cast shadows given these
constraints it's relatively easy to
create a view with elevation that
doesn't render the way one expects we're
going to make extensive use of relative
layout to avoid having to add extra
hierarchy which would prevent us from
creating the kind of shadows that the
design requires one more thing on pre L
versions of Android card view doesn't
clip
contents to the bounds of the curved
rectangle but instead adds padding to
avoid having that content overlap the
shadow area since we have a dark
background on part of our card this
makes a little white line show up since
the corner overlap looks more benign
than these white lines I recommend
setting card prevent corner overlap
equals false on our card views</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
