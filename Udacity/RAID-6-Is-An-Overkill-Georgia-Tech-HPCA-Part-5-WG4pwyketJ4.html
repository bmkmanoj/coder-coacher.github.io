is that when in grade 5 a disk fails it
takes up to a couple of days to replace
sometimes you have a spare disk and
usually data center will have that it's
going to take less than an hour and
there is a very very low probability
that another disk in the array will fail
in those three days if it fails after
these three days it doesn't matter
because by then we are back to being
protected by the extra disc so the
failure of the second is needs to happen
in the time when one of the disc is in
the failed state but that assumes that
the disk failures are independent but
the failures can be related to each
other in which case this is not correct
to assume a typical scenario when this
can happen is let's say that we have a
raid five with five disks and one of the
disk fails let's say that this number
two in the array has failed the system
reports that the disk has failed and
continues functioning normally remember
that it can do that with one failed disk
in raid five and now the operator gets a
replacement disc opens the computer case
and sees five drives like this note that
the number two has failed so it takes
this one out and puts the new drive in
but for example the numbering of the
disks was actually zero one two three
four so we pulled out the wrong drive
this was the failed one when we pulled
this second one that was the second
failure and now we really have to fail
disks one failed because it failed the
other one failed in the course of trying
to repair the first failure so that's
for example a case of correlated
failures and in that case we cannot
assume independence so pretty much when
a disk fails the actions to repair it
are creating a lot more risk for the
other disks and may cause a second
failure and that for example where you
want to have raid six when one fails and
you're trying to repair it if another
one fails for any reason independent or
dependent on the first failure
you are still safe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
