where we have Google Apple gold and
Exxon from the beginning of 2010 to the
end of 2010 this is what the performance
of that portfolio would look like in the
blue line if we had an equal allocation
to each asset so we gave 25% to each of
those stocks at the beginning and then
we observed at the end the total
performance and we include here a chart
for S&amp;amp;P 500 for comparison now this is a
unoptimized portfolio here's what it
would look like if we optimize for
Sharpe ratio look at that look how much
higher performance we get compared to
our benchmark S&amp;amp;P 500 and observe over
here the allocations to the assets 60%
goes to gold 40% to Apple and none to
Google or Exxon now one thing to
emphasize here is this is looking back
in time so we're looking back
historically what happened in 2010 and
observing at the beginning of 2010 if we
knew what we knew now how should we best
allocate so there's a question as to how
much this can help our portfolio going
forward and I'll give you that answer
ahead of time indeed when we optimize
for Sharpe ratio hold that portfolio
rebalance in other words reoptimize for
Sharpe ratio and continue that month by
month we very often most frequently see
that that improves the performance of
the portfolio versus just an equal
allocation but I do want to observe that
this is computing back in time so yes of
course we can find a better portfolio
but indeed it helps going forward as
well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
