biologist here at 23andme have been with
the company for about two years now and
I'm mostly working on their ancestry
products which rent from a variety of
different problems before that I was a
postdoc at UC Berkeley for another two
years and even before that I was a PhD
student in France well so a
computational biologist I think is
always someone was trying to give up or
at least to implement computational
methods to analyze biological data so in
in my field in genetics even in my field
there is a wide variety of different
data and a wide variety of different
applications so a computational
biologist could be someone developing
pipeline to analyze war genome sequences
for example just from the raw data 20
lineman's to calling the snv's from the
raw data and just process the data so
it's really for statistics for example
to try to preserve process it could be
someone like me was for me a very bad
very big part of my job is machine
learning so it could be someone who's
really interested in machine learning
and trying to extract sense from the
data directly it comes from the from the
realization i think that amount of
genetic data is huge and growing really
fast and even maybe more problematic is
the complexity of the data like any
single phenotype is going to be
influenced by not any single but many
many phenotypes is going to be
influenced by a lot of different genes
it's very very out to to find exactly
the structure in the data so machine
learning is one way to to tackle the
problem and I think it's a way that's
proved successful already so here at 20
thread me I think it's safe to say that
all the computational biologists came
from the computer side of things they're
up training either in computer science
or in maths or in statistics and then
on biology later as fascinating
application filled for data scientists
basically and so as you know biology and
genetics course you think there will be
an opportunity for many more
computational individuals who are
interested to sort of learn genetics and
biology and apply that yes definitely I
think I honestly think that biology is
the science of the 21st century nothing
laughs and it will change everything for
most people it will revolutionize
medicine being preventive or or
personalized it will yeah it will
basically change the daily life of
everyone I guess and we need more people
and I think many many more jobs are
going to be created around around
computational biology so I developed
another features at 23andme called
ancestry composition which goal is to
find the origin of off segments not as
precise of finding who you share it with
but where does it come from so it could
come from some part of Europe it could
come from some part of East Asia or some
part of Africa so my undergrad was in
applied math and computer science and
then I went on to do a PhD in statistics
and because the way that was in France
and because the way it works in France I
had to choose a field of application for
statistics and that's only then that I
began to think about genetics because my
pee I was very interested in population
genetics which is this field in genetics
where we try to learn about human
evolution so natural selection
demography ancestry identity by descent
so and I became interested as well and i
developed statistical learning method to
learn about the genetic structure
subpopulations after my PhD I decided to
do a postdoc here at UC Berkeley because
I had a very good opportunity with
someone very famous in the field
population genetics and there I was
lucky enough to work on the first draft
of the Neanderthal genome so I actually
had the first fool unit or genome
sitting on my hard drive and I could
just do my my stuff with it anything I
wanted it's awesome and I contributed to
develop methods that estimated the
amount of Neanderthal DNA is that modern
humans of today if there was somebody
watching this interview right now and
they're really intrigued about how
biology and computer science and math
statistics work together in a particular
job what advice would you give them to
study in school what would you recommend
that they do when maybe where would you
recommend that they seek you know career
advice or work from yeah so as I said I
do believe there is needs for
specialists so I do recommend they keep
studying math and computer science and
statistics a lot but they still need to
take some biology at the very least to
figure what are the problems that we
need to solve today in biology and how
to relate you know it's not enough to
get out of school and no list of 10
fastest algorithm for each specific
problems that you learn in school you
also need to be able to relate to great
class of algorithms to different
problems in biology oh you will need to
adapt them how sometimes you have to
realize that there is nothing that
exists already and you need to develop
something that's not going to be optimal
probably but you need to do a first pass
as a problem so you do need to know
enough biology at the very least to
understand the problems otherwise for
example for ancestry if you don't have a
very clear understanding of the
recombination process there is nothing
you can do you need you need to
understand exactly what probabilistic
model you can put behind meiosis often
it's going to break a chromosome all
these things so you do need to know it
not by Rho G to in a sense of problems
definitely so you need to take at least
an intro to biologically
sore or something at the very least</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
