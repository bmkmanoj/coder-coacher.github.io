remembering at its core is levels of
processing for this concept
psychologists say that the more deeply
we encode information the better we're
able to recall it now what do we mean by
deeply psychologists have identified
three different levels of processing
before I get started in describing this
I want you to remember these three words
tablet Bell amethyst okay let's get
started the first is structural the
second is phonetic and the third is
semantic so for the level of processing
structural would be shallow then we'd go
down to semantic which would be deep and
remember the more deeply encoded the
information the better we recall it so
let's look at probability of recall the
shallow level of processing would give
us a low probability of recalling the
information and the deep level of
processing would give us a high
probability of recall let's say for
example I wanted you to remember the
word amethyst at the structural level I
may ask you to describe whether the word
has capital letters or lowercase letters
at the phonetic level I may ask you to
think of words that rhyme with amethyst
and finally at the semantic level I may
ask you to describe what an amethyst is
it's purple it's in fact a stone and
it's even the birthstone for the month
of February
here psychologists would say if you're
able to engage in all three levels of
processing semantic phonetic and
structural we would have a better
ability to recall the information at a
later time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
