and security management is to be better
prepared when it comes to cyber security
so if your enterprise of your company if
you ask how well prepared you are how
good is the state of cyber security we
really that's what the cyber security
posture is so cyber security posture how
do we address cybersecurity how we
prepare ourselves for cyber security how
do we handle and something goes wrong so
the posture can either be reactive
unfortunately in in many cases this is
what it is and what is the reactive mean
well we worry about it because we sort
of forced to do it because there's
regulation compliance requirements they
say you must do so and we react to that
regulation that comes down our throats
or its customer demands customers saying
i will not do business with you unless
you have that a lot of companies these
days especially business-to-business b2b
they don't want to do business with
someone who has lacks cyber security so
again it's we react to this demand that
comes from somebody we want to do
business with it could be in response to
something bad that happens to us okay so
as a breach for example the target home
depot examples everybody talks about so
we react to the adverse event that we
suffered so that's another example of
what reactive security posture is and
finally it may be in response to events
that you know occur our competition may
have suffered one bank for examples of
ours a breach and other banks may react
to that by making sure that the
vulnerabilities that were exploited
don't exist in their IT systems so all
these are examples of so this is a
reactive posture I said unfortunately
security is event-driven when something
bad happens people say oh we need it and
so we need to do something about it but
this is what is called a reactive
posture to cybersecurity course it's
better to have what is called a
proactive approach to security you plan
for it that hood security planning is
talking about you work hard to assess
your risk you do things to reduce it
look at
cost and do that before either you were
forced because of regulation or forced
because something bad happens to you and
you respond to it or react to it so what
are some examples of proactive things
that a company should be doing well
first of all it should be somebody's job
to worry about cyber securities and it
assets you know how they protected how
people are educated cyber security
insurance having a good policy making
sure you know people are held
responsible and empowered to do things
and all the things we talked about when
it comes to security planning and
management so having a champion the job
it is to worry about it champion should
have influence if it doesn't he or she
doesn't have influence of course they're
not going to get anything meaningful
done so one thing people talk about for
example is well is this proactively
address at the highest level in an
organization at to talk about the board
level conversation the board addresses
varies kind of risks and enterprise has
to deal with it cyber security risk one
of those or is there a conversation
about it is there a conversation about
what needs to be done to reduce that
risk is their investment made in cyber
security controls and solutions and
personnel and things like that if that's
done before bad things happen that would
be a proactive approach it's again
unfortunately we not there where this is
happening every company in fact one of
the things that happen we said target
hire to cso who does the CSO report to
the CSO report to cio well when it's not
you know talking about it the highest
level it doesn't report with this CEO
the CEO maybe doesn't bring it up at the
board level and things like that so
proactive means somebody the champion
looks ahead has the influence that's
necessary and has supported the highest
levels and that would be a proactive
posture for cybersecurity</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
