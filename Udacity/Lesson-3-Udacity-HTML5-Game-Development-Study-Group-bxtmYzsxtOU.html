you
you
you
you
welcome everybody thanks for coming to
the University html5 programming study
work study group I've really excited to
have you all here in San Francisco live
and also online on the live stream say
hello everybody say hello to the
Internet hello hello Internet we'll do
this again you want I take that hello
back yeah they weren't there for us when
we needed work more energy guys welcome
everybody over here in life from san
francisco in the Udacity 805 game
programming were a study group with me
is Colt McAnlis hello from google and
Sean Bennett course architect at Udacity
and I'm Peter lubbers program manager at
Google so we're excited to have you back
this is our third episode in this study
group it's an eight-week study group if
you haven't seen the different episodes
and you can go to Google developers live
or on the Udacity a website under the
training course and you can find
information there a couple of updates we
have made a small change to the contest
deadline so we're running if you weren't
familiar with it this is there's still
enough time to get into it we're running
a contest in parallel with the course
and a few observant people figured that
the contest was actually ending before
the course was over so we didn't like
that and or they didn't like it then we
didn't dinner so we've actually changed
it and it's now going to be done I think
a week after the course ends so that the
details are on the website so we're
sending out an update with that
information soon but stay tuned for that
and you'll have a little bit extra time
so again not too late to start this
contest it's a great way to sort of
figure out if you if you've understood
the concepts
um what else any other announcements or
before we get into it I think you wanted
to say a little well no we want to talk
about the ad bussing oh yeah right wait
if you're here in the room not on the
live stream don't worry about this if
you're on one take your fine dinner
plates with you and put them into
bussing station if you wouldn't mind
that would be very much appreciated by
the way the food courtesy of google
again live stream sorry yeah it was a
really good tonight very good you you
can get you should grab some on the live
stream yeah hell yeah this dream
definitely get some all right let's dive
right into it's a cold do you wanted to
talk a bit about your rants about so uh
show hands how many people were here
live last week okay fantastic my people
okay put your hands down show of hands
how many people who didn't raise the
hands before watched last week's stream
okay fantastic all right so so since
last week I got a nice sweet i think is
the proper term for of emails from
individuals saying why are you so hard
on javascript your you know your bald
anger is hurting the web development
community and don't attack us as a
people so i want to take a little bit of
time before we get into the awesome set
of questions that we have for today as
well as the the live interaction we have
and kind of make sure that that it's
very framed about what javascript is and
what the web development community is it
from a term of a game programmer so
javascript is still a pretty new
language and again this is the perfect
time to remind everyone then my opinions
are my own and not that of any
representative association that I may
have some organization with Sir John
shrimp is a pretty new language and when
you look at when javascript was actually
created it was back before the web was
it was today it's it's really difficult
to think about that when javascript was
originally created a Pinterest it didn't
exist Facebook didn't exist right ebay
didn't exist right i mean this is back
when d HTML was first coming on the
stream I don't even think google com
existed right so this was a language in
the specification created for a very
different internet that we have today
and so the question that we have to ask
ourselves as a web development community
most like most importantly as engineers
right because I think that's most
important part you're writing code you
need to approach this from an engineer's
mentality is does the current JavaScript
setup have all the things at me
to help usher us into the next 20 years
of web development what things are we
going to create what things are we going
to expect what are we going to start
doing with new ideas and new patterns
and that's why you start seeing the
emergence of things like dark as a
programming language or typescript or
even Native Client right because people
starting to ask new questions starting
to put new demands on what the web is
JavaScript can do a lot of these things
I know there's a lot of interest out
there i've seen some articles from intel
talking about adding simdi to javascript
and i think some of the mozilla guys are
trying to figure out how to vectorize
that data and things along those lines
and that's fantastic that's great if
you've ever written a language from
scratch though hint how many of you
written language from scratch CS 50 100
you actually you actually realized that
a lot of the the subtle nuances in
writing and designing a language have
less to do with the functional
parameters that are provided to it and
more to the aesthetic quality of the
mental model that the human brain
attaches to it there was a fantastic
research study done about a year and a
half ago about mathematics and children
this is a great little diatribe that I'm
going to real quick so they took a bunch
of students who spoke different
languages all from the same age group
all had some a similar monetization
based backgrounds right so they didn't
take like poor people and rich people
and compare them lately trying to make
sure that everyone is in the same
bracket monetarily then they started
doing math quizzes at them and what they
actually found was the individuals the
students who actually spoke Chinese did
about forty percent better than any
other language and so they said well is
this you know they tried to drill down
they try to drill down and what they
finally came to it was that it wasn't
ethnic it wasn't genetic it wasn't any
of those things is actually it was
actually a language-based turns out that
the human brain can only store a certain
amount of data in its short term memory
at for a certain amount of time it's
about eight pieces of data or about ten
seconds worth of short-term memory right
and so what happens was the Chinese
words for the first ten letters or the
first ten numbers are shorter than the
anglo-saxon representation so they can
actually remember more of the numbers
that were in their head to actually do
these long mathematical problems this
was a verification that basically we're
all running the same hardware right
we're all human in some
former another although I've been called
other things by other people right so
while lumen the difference is how how
the language is processing on top of
this hardware right is what our software
is actually doing and so a lot of the
times when you get these dogmatic
individuals who come to the table and
say I will only program on Ruby let's
get Ruby on the web most of the time
it's not because of the functional
aspects of Ruby but because it meets
their mental model so I'm very harsh on
JavaScript because I get a lot of
dogmatic people coming to me telling me
you know you shouldn't put C++ on the
web we shouldn't have native code
operation on the web and and these are
very dogmatic statements and I always
try to attack that with pragmatic
statements right like okay how many
years do you think that'll go until we
start asking for more device access in
JavaScript right how long do you think
that's going to go before we start
asking for faster prototypes right the
fact we already have typed arrays and
cindy support and these things is you
know you kind of start seeing this
language evolution over time and anytime
you start seeing that you're gonna
you're going to fork you're going to get
different languages you're going to get
different people coming out of different
different angles when c-sharp came out
we saw d sharp come out which all d we
saw f come out at all f sharp come out
we ever saw see pound now we never saw
any musicians in the room mark so flat
maybe you see flat baby I don't know um
so anyhow I want to make sure that it's
very clear that when when approaching a
language you should very much always
take the pragmatic approach to it what
tool does it solve where does it fit in
your toolbox and what you should do with
it right it'll take the dogmatic
approach because otherwise someone's
going to hit you with a stick and most
likely they'll be bold
right well on that note so if there are
any questions in a room here there's a
mic up front and it's actually two
microphones one for the room and one for
two for the live stream so we'll start
with a couple questions from the
moderator and the first one is is there
any good scaffolding approach to game
development and that was a question from
school 84 in Sydney I'm not entirely
sure what this is asking yeah that does
anyone have any idea of what this person
is asking i'm not sure what you mean by
scaffolding good could you come up to
the this mikes of the reaction so that
they can hear you in the live stream
sorry i think i can get body is asking
because I i had the same question what
is asking is when you start a project
like a web application project we take a
django or Ruby on Rails you have a you
have some small commands like initial
set of commands which you run sets up
the directory structure sets of the
initial template and then sets up
everything else for you so that you go
about and fill in the smaller details
and your web app is ready so I think he
is pointing out that yo man yeah um so
thank you for that after I think it's
very insightful this is this is where
one of those areas where my game
development background of just throw
code at it and solve it later kind of
hurts us right don't know the
terminology so yes we do have a concept
of what web developers will call
scaffolding in the games industry and we
mostly call these game engines right so
so this is the setup protocol where an
engine comes to the table mostly its
content driven right it comes with a map
editor and a scripting prototype and a
model editor and some package libraries
binary file access things along those
lines unreal 3 render where gamebryo
these are these are quintessential types
of game engines that you would use that
so effectively you know companies will
license these game engines and then all
they have to focus on is the scripting
or at least that's what they're sold
write it in reality if any developers in
here have ever work
unreal 3 you realize that unless you're
making a game that's exactly like Gears
of War you have a lot of work under your
table to actually make that engine do
something differently and I haven't
looked at unreal 3 in a year and a half
or so so I hope they've changed a lot of
that that underlines things but I
constant get emails from people that's
like I spent more time trying to fight
the memory model in unreal 3 today to
get it fitting on the xbox 360 yeah why
did we ever license an engine of course
that has you know pros and cons but
you'd have to be pragmatic about it when
you licensed an engine you gain lots of
leverage but you also gain lots of new
things you have to fix too so if you're
looking for a scaffolding library for
game development I would say look for a
game engine go go through that process
any of the game impact JSI would start
with ejecta is also from the impact j/s
guys I don't I don't I don't have some
great chance and hazel chance yeah
easeljs yeah well he's a chance is kind
of a sense / yeah HS yes is like an
overall package though vidhan yeah so
there's also create j/s which includes
easeljs a number of other things and
includes things like asset loading
libraries and anna memory model and
something that is a lot closer to action
script i guess and then kind of model
that you would have in a typical flash
environment so you also have something
like that was burned yeah any other
build things maybe no I was taking yo
little man yeah as a general scaffolding
it I mean it's definitely made for
scaffolding I don't think I've never use
it for games and I don't know I'm
actually be curious to see if anyone
here for their own games have used
yeoman everyone familiar with you Owen
okay so yell when they check it out
that's why II oh ma n dot io yo mando yo
you mean you and so you checked it out
it's really great for I scaffolding
regular wet projects gaming I think
you're pretty much gonna be stuck pretty
quickly so
that looks like an answer to questions
all right okay so next question from soo
boss at from Amsterdam my parents
hometown is there any free alternative
to texture Packer that's as good look
yeah yeah so texture Packer if you
downloaded it does come with a trial
evaluation period so you actually play
with it um if you're looking for an
alternative to that you pretty much have
to write your own I've actually got an
article if you hit my blog main road
blogspot com there's a nice little
articles button that you can click on
actually take you to a game dev or an
alt game dev add a blog i did on
creating texture atlases which is
effectively another extension of what we
kind of covered in the Udacity course
right at the bottom of that there's a
whole paragraph dedicated to how to
write your own texture Packer with with
links to source code and examples that
people have already done effectively
what you're looking for is an algorithm
called an algorithm called
two-dimensional bin packing right now
texture Packer does some really cool
things most of it that probably the best
part is how its UI driven right but if
you want a command line version or you
want something else or if you just don't
want to pay for it you know there's
source code out there already on github
and source for words and all these other
places that you can go grab and play
with you got play with source though
just to follow up to that what if you
you know your games only going to have
20 images and everything but you really
want to use the principles from this
course then you just go into an image
editor and you just pack it up you want
to so do you have a diagram that
basically says what were the rules for a
typical Atlas from about where the
center is and where the what you
discussed last week the new tremana okay
and if you did that we could you can
literally roll your own ok and again
learn something but you don't
necessarily even have to write your code
for it yes there's yet two questions
there from what I hear in it number one
is you know if you only have 20 images
is it worth going through the effort to
write a full texture packing system
and that's here they're right i mean if
you have if you have all the
architecture in place and all you have
to do is just drag some images into a
folder there's no reason the derivate
from that and hopefully what we provide
in the class is enough of an
architecture to make it easy for you to
work with that being said if you want to
go and do it all by hand that's
something mostly you automate because
you know artists are just gonna like
numbers there they like fire it's bad
okay so can i let's go ahead and move
over to the live stream so the moderator
the next question is could you please
use more or any explanatory diagrams oh
wait actually hope is that the wrong one
okay what I'm sorry yeah yeah okay at
what point should we have covered enough
material to be able to tackle the
contest does the game have to use grits
mm okay actually I would say that you
can start writing right now I mean you
can make up a concept and see what works
for you could definitely the design
process right now and kind of think
through the game flow and how you want
the user to experience the game and then
add in more about the actual
architecture of the game later do you
want to add something that's no good
yeah so one of the the follow up here
was does the game have to use grits and
the answer is no you can really build
your own game it doesn't have to really
resemble grits and in fact there was a
question about even what language is to
use obviously we will expect this to be
somewhat similar to to grits in the end
like a JavaScript game but people have
asked if they can use dart which then
compiles to JavaScript and it that's
totally fine forget that this here
tonight but people are trying it out and
that's not a problem but in the end
we're looking for a web-based you know
canvas game but there was someone in the
audience do you mind telling just a
group a little bit about your game that
you're working on
oh yeah maybe oh yeah on a microphone
we're putting you on the spot sorry
hahaha you up am I really like the idea
yeah it was really quick not no dining
this is not a game yet this is just an
idea but uh I was thinking that a lot of
times when people are learning to
program they really need to build a
muscle memory and learning syntax and so
I want to invent a game called launch
codes where you're basically copying
code that's already built and you write
a function and it shoots a missile and
you right up if statement and it shoots
you know you write a loop and it shoots
like you know several something like
that and it sounds it seems pretty
simple and I'm just kind of figuring out
a billet out now after yeah if anyone
wants to help me with that feel free to
help you to help you along with that
definitely check out an open source
project on the web called block e BL 0
ck my block e is sort of an extension of
a graphical programming language for its
kind of extension of turtle and star and
a lot of those but it's all written in
JavaScript and html5 and so you can
actually like grab and drop functional
visual blocks but the cool thing is is
that as it defines a functional piece of
data it also defines what that should
output on the other side so if you're
looking for how do you automate your
scripting system to go through this
stuff take a look at the blocky source
code because it's actually gonna lie to
you to say an if statement as a
functional paradigm should actually call
this code to want the files e missiles
definitely check it out it's a really
cool set up in fact one of one of the
games i was working on that I'm not
allowed to talk about we were actually
trying to find a solution for a
scripting language for designers because
designers come to the table and they
don't want to program they don't like
programming but they need the program
because that's part of their job and so
they always want like a dumb down
watered-down version of some programming
language because the programmers we
don't want them in our source code
anyway because they're just going to
muck it up right so we actually
investigated using blocky for their
actual programming language like allow
them to actually do their their graph
objects and their logic nodes and
everything else using that setup on
html5 so is
full functional I was actually very
happy with it alright so next question
is could you please use more or any
explanatory diagram so I guess the
answer would be yeah yes um I think so
we I think we've done a pretty good job
on some of the lessons to have some
introductory diagram showing what things
are about I guess we could always do a
better job so Carl will definitely look
into that for future courses I mean
everything is pretty much in the
pipeline right now so we can't do that
much about it but we'll say that a
couple of people on this on the larger
in the larger group of taking this
course and have done some interesting
explanations by way of diagram and we
want to thank you for all of that hard
work because some of those diagrams have
been really good than they somehow
should be incorporated back into the
course yeah and I'd also like to say
that for for any kind of feedback along
those lines like suggestions for better
visual feedback the more explicit and
it's specific you can be the better for
us I mean we want to make this better so
all the feedback you can throw at us I
am I think we are all four I had to to
JavaScript for um specific questions for
homework on Atlas or that list unit the
first one is
declaring the gmat variable and then
assigning this to it I was wondering it
was that done just to make it make the
code more readable or was that to
actually define this for that object is
it the VAR was actually in the object so
I wasn't quite sure why oh those were
this equals G map was it was at this
equals G mapper was at gmac people's
this G Matthews yeah that because of the
sorry so the question was during the
this was in the the map loading code yes
right yeah ok so the question was in the
in the map loading code the Ted map
loading code there's there's a line that
says VAR g map equals this now if you
notice a little bit lower we actually
referenced the gmaps variable inside of
a closure ok right and so basically what
happens is we needed to pass that
variable to the closure but
unfortunately the closure didn't accept
a parameter to be passed to it so we
kind of took advantage of the gotchas
inside of javascript by declaring a
locally scoped variable that pointed to
this object which is the entire map
parser such that disclosure that
occurred sometime in the future outside
of the scope of this object would then
have access to that entire system so so
basically we couldn't use the this
object inside of that closure because
when it's executed in a different scope
I see so basically it was our hack to
get around that you know cuz again
everything in JavaScript cigar my friend
gotcha and the second question I have is
I was using a more in statement to loop
through um to loop through the tile sets
and I got instead of one I got two and I
was wondering I mean we talked about
this a little bit before course the
class start but um I was wondering if
you guys are familiar enough with the
actual object to tell me what was that
second thing that was referring to in my
in the floor in statement so I was
sleeping through the tile sets so Matt
I'll sides this is probably if you were
doing a you're doing so like 4x in array
yeah but they're Ray had an object in it
and I feel ok so how 4x in array or X in
object and JavaScript works is it just
goes through that objects prototypes not
all the prototypes so it doesn't just go
through the elements in the array it
also checks like if if it's a has a
prototype has a gun empty yeah empty or
dot length or something like that then
it will actually try to loop through
that as well ok so so it's not just
looping through the elements than they
write that that's what what that might
be is you know it's it's probably just
something that is part of the array
object it's probably not something that
is local to our code we actually guess
maybe so again so there's a couple
things that are first off for blanking
doesn't actually iterate through the
objects that it rates to the properties
and if you notice in well I don't think
they have access to court GS yeah you
have a new p.m. so if you notice in core
DJ s we actually define a couple array
extenders so like a raid remove or array
dot split or something along those lines
which are effectively like common array
operations that you want to do so like a
red dot or remove should have been part
of the spec I don't know why in
someone's infinite wisdom dot remove the
most common concept to an array that
actually make it into these spec instead
you have to do slice right then you have
to have this logic on how many things am
I slicing and you know so so we actually
extend it inside of court jas where we
say array dot prototype dot remove and
then you give the element index and then
we do the slicing on your behalf so so
chances are if you're iterating through
that array object in it and a blank for
wide containers I like that you're
actually getting the properties of the
object and you're seeing this other
stuff we added ok gotcha now that being
said the the blank in our contain I
don't even know the proper syntax with
us yeah so if you say like it if name in
hash table that's fine right because
it's actually it's actually querying
whether or not that key element exists
inside of that hash table it's just that
looping construct that's actually a
little tricky they're not a lot of maybe
this is something we can fix on web cut
docs not a lot of people talk about that
syntax and how that syntax doesn't do
what every other language actually does
with that syntax so I think this is a
valuable point yeah it's definitely one
of those JavaScript gotchas they're just
really good a panel basically you really
shouldn't do the four blank in each or
whatever the syntax is on JavaScript
objects because it can go painfully
unless you're a bit you really know what
you're doing yeah I don't know I'm gonna
have this much fun okay you know we're
just trying to figure out if he has
enough battery that's right yeah yeah I
think it's like then I welcome tries to
break the internet yeah um look at nine
percent left we're gonna read all the
questions the question is my html5 gun
game runs extremely fast and smooth on
my desktop machine but the game becomes
multitude slower on android tablet the
Nexus 7 where can I check to see how I
can speed up the game I only have a very
few sprites moving around fantastic
question everybody in here's gonna fall
asleep before I finish answering it I'm
just letting you know that right now
let's start at the top um so your
desktop machine chances are has multiple
cores lots of extra v ram memory in a
very powerful onboard GPU that sucks as
much power as it can from that wall
socket as you want a hefty GPUs a couple
years ago it took about five hundred
Watts I think the new ones take 700 some
crazy thing we have to have a cooling
system and extra dude running on a
treadmill to actually how are the thing
your tablet on the other hand does not
have that much power basic push to it
does not have that same amount of GPU or
cpu power megahertz processing strength
before it so first off you have to come
to that concept is that your desktop
machine is multitude faster and just
more powerful and capable at a
processing level that in your pocket
your pop you can do some really cool
things but it can't do everything your
desktop can do so that means things are
going to run slower so now let's talk
functionally about why your canvas
rasterization
it's actually running slower on these
devices chances so the weird thing about
this is that no one in this question is
actually talking about what grounds are
the run you're using stock Android
browser unfortunately the canvas
rasterization is really slow so so all
of our code that we talked about here is
all about canvas it's not about
modifying Dom elements because that's
just insane in a box so we actually do
proper rendering if you're using a nun
stock Android browser that's not going
to be fast that was never optimized to
be faster in that process now if you're
using a chrome stable as of a couple
days ago which I think was 20 24 or 25 I
think on the canvas runner it was
actually pretty good but still not as
good as it should have been I think
Chrome Beta actually has a lot of
increases there basically I came down to
the engineers making sure that their
code paths underneath the hood are
actually optimize in the proper patterns
to take advantage of the fact that
they're running on lower powered
hardware you will also see in my blog
series as well as the Udacity course we
talked about the fact of additional
overhead that calls comes from a draw
call so in computer graphics we have
this concept that you know you do a lot
of crazy stuff and you actually call
objective draw right and primitive draw
believe it or not actually has a ton of
CPU overhead associated with it because
that CPU draw has to go down into the
api's and do a lot of type checking and
initialization and pass the memory
around maybe make some copies cook some
souffle you know change outfits once or
twice before it's ready to go to the
ball and then what happens is when all
that's finally done then it actually
issues the command down to the driver
level of your operating system which
then upon its own good at well time will
actually issue the thing out to the the
bus and actually get to the graphics
hardware so what you're looking at is
stacks of overhead here from a single
draw call canvas is no different right
so if your canvas or the browser that
you're using actually has software
accelerated canvas that means it's doing
all of that stuff in software
rasterization it's not actually using
the GPU to accelerate anything is one of
the reasons the stock android browser is
actually so slow it's all software
rendering if you notice in the latest
chrome everything is actually GPU
accelerated for canvas rendering which
actually means they're going through the
right primitives in the scale library
it's actually have the GPU draw this
stuff but there's still a significant
amount of overhead for those draw calls
the
article I'm doing in my blog series so
the first one was how to load Ted's the
second one was how to accelerate your
canvas rendering using grits prototype
the next was actually about ping pong
canvases and the interesting about that
is we actually use this old school old
old old school technique that John
Carmack and those guys kind of found out
about about using dirty rectangles to
invalidate certain parts of the screen
and then just shifting the entire canvas
over like eight pixels at a time so
basically you'd like shift the previous
frame over eight pixels and then you did
validate where the new sprites were and
then you would only draw those locations
because you were only updating like one
sixteenth of the entire buffer things
ran faster so the new article that I'm
writing is how to use this technique in
html5 the problem with is on the Nexus 7
it still runs dog slow about 22 23
frames a second and the problem there is
nothing to do with the GPU it's actually
humming along pretty well it's all the
overhead in our internal layer to
actually handle all those draw calls
because if you guys know the standard
grits map actually does about 200 draw
calls of frame if you're not actually
using all these tiling techniques so
this is a very complex question right
here so even though you may have a few
sprites running around you might be on
the stock android browser which is going
to be running slower or you may be in
one of the later ones but not actually
you're still doing a lot of draw calls
for those single sprites you may not
have proper calling enabled or something
along those lines because you know if
you're using a little dude and you have
a full background might not be doing
yeah so um yeah how many people will
fell asleep on that when I saw two and
three yeah okay mad props yeah obviously
grind out as late for me houses i start
my start my day at 5am oh yes that's
let's go second yeah see how it so um if
you're doing development for chrome on
Android Google for a term on basically
it's an article by Boris Smith's sm us
and he actually talks about remote
android remote debugging and so
effectively what you do is you download
the android development tools and so
it's basically just a copy it doesn't
mess with your registry or anything and
then you can actually go to a command
line and run an adb commands so
basically there's an abb is executable
in the directory called a TV you run adb
with
command-line argument that actually will
forward what's going on on your Android
in your Chrome browser to your desktop
machine so this is where it gets really
cool basically on your on your desktop
you browse to localhost 9222 and then on
it'll show you what tabs are open on
your android and you can actually click
on one it'll open dev tools and then
devtools works exactly as it would on
your desktop you can put breakpoints in
the code you can change the CSS you can
actually run a tracing tool and so
basically all of the standard techniques
that you would do to optimize your
performance on the desktop you can now
do the same thing on Chrome for Android
so I would definitely say start there if
you want to dig deeper from that for
those of you daring souls who like
getting into the belly of the beast or
you realize that you know dev tools and
some of the other about tracing stuff
doesn't give you the full you know like
hey I have one function that's running
slow and I don't know why you can
actually check out a new library that i
actually just uploaded to my github
account that hoop when I can get a
github account sorry main github.com /
main Roche and it's under the sandbox
section it's called needle Jas needle is
an inline invasive profiler and so
basically what this means is you litter
your code with begin and end blocks and
then what needle will do is actually
measure the time Delta's in this scoped
environment and then spit it out in a
format a very very fine grain that you
can load into about tracing or something
else and actually see where all your
time is going about tracing and dev
tools do a great job of getting you
close to this stuff but I haven't
actually been able to get data closer
than the functional level and for the
dev tool guys dev tool team that's
watching this I apologize that my
ignorance if there's something some
better way to do it but for those of you
guys who really want to dive deep and
drill down definitely check out needle
j/s on my github account any other
statement like world's more on dev tools
stuff
yeah pretty cool elaborate so maybe
should a URL again yeah yeah so that's
that's on my github that's going to be
github com / main roach one word I'm
sure someone's gonna come up to me
afterwards ago where did you get your
nickname main roach I'm going to tell
you as I've told the hundreds of people
before you that answer requires beer
okay okay next question can we use any
frameworks besides box2d in the game
contest yeah just yeah I mean yeah you
use whatever you think it works for you
really I mean we're going to be looking
at basically the end results it's right
exactly yeah well and if you want to use
other web languages like dart or other
languages that compile down a JavaScript
if you want to use other frameworks
box2d if you want to use you know a game
engine framework sure you know make a
cool game that's really the goal next
question from cheek creative from
Germany can we use some of the graphics
and sounds of grits for the contest
would love to use some of this heart on
my game idea it's all weapons it's all
open source so it's it's all open source
and the assets are all licensed under
the apache to library yeah so yeah i'll
say that into the microphone it's all
open source and all of the art and sound
assets that aren't already contributed
to Creative Commons or whatever or under
the Apache to library so I am NOT legal
counsel nor will I ever be legal counsel
I quite frankly don't know what apache2
means at a business definition level but
it's expected that you do if you use it
okay next question why as xhr get
changed from its original definition
this is because it was making and this
is your fault
this is this is because it was making
very liberal use of this ah that's right
yeah that's right and when you because
of the way this works this isn't
actually that the keyword this is so
hard to talk about whole language is ago
yeah the whole language is a guy got the
whole languages we need to create with
we didn't come up with a new meta
language that describes the concepts of
the language that we're writing and
programming it yeah yeah instead of it
just copying other languages will call
it widget def yeah sure yeah so so this
in languages that games are typically
written in does not mean what this means
in JavaScript this is in regular
languages basically a call to the object
contest like like the encompassing
object and in JavaScript it's actually a
call to the calling calling options that
correct that I've not the expert on
JavaScript gotchas but so if I am say
running a grading script over your code
and calling your code to test it and it
uses this then instead of this being say
you know the xhr get encompass Inaba or
anything like that or this being say the
tiled map class this will actually be
the grading framework the testing
framework i'm using like mocha or chai
so it's trying to get you know mocha dot
you know color or something like that
and it doesn't know what that is because
it doesn't exist so that that's why the
definition has changed because it made
very very liberal use of this my fault
yeah I never said I was a good
programmer you people just give a
student of us hey this is mine yeah um
so I'm gonna preface that I love this
question I absolutely love this question
I think it's pronounced with George York
from Austria art if you have lots of
entities in your game and you're
processing interactions between them
like collision or even non
location-based events this is an awesome
question
the easy approaches 0 to the N square so
effectively you loop through all of the
items and then you check if that item is
touching all the other items right so
that's that's Big O notation what ways
of optimization are there can you
recommend some resources about that the
reason that this is an awesome question
is because for a number of years now you
actually used a variance of this
question as an interview question for
any job I worked at which is fantastic
so if let's rephrase this question in a
different way and this is kind of a nice
little exercise for everyone out there
playing the game at home so let's put it
this another way if you have a data a
data file and in this data file you've
got a million points 2d points XY
positions right and you read this data
file into memory and I ask you hey
here's a point in space give me the
closest point from your original array
to this new input point right the step
would be oh well let's iterate over
everything and see if it's close that's
going to end up in this sort of similar
pattern then you say okay well hey now
we've got 20 million what are you
supposed to do that then you start
thinking about like oh wow well I guess
we go into bucketing right I'm a firm
believer that there's really only four
major principles in computer programming
for optimizing something it's like
caching bucketing threading and culling
yeah right and so bucketing so hey what
if we actually divide our
two-dimensional space into you know 64
pixels by 64 pixels right and then when
you query a point or basically when all
the points are read in you say hey
you're in this 64 pixel x 64 pixel block
and then when the input point comes in
you only have to choose what block right
so you're basically transforming space
there you go okay cool so what's the
next step past that what if all of the
you know million points are in this
lower left-hand corner and the input
points way up there obviously you're not
going to find the closest point to this
input point so what's what's the next
step past that then you actually have to
start looking at new data structures to
sort of represent your input in memory
right if you start looking at abt trees
BST trees binary space patrician red
black trees trees Austria
now that's yeah yeah our trees are still
going to give you a static based
definition structure you want KD trees
are a fantastic algorithm out there to
effectively you got to go back to the
source you have to start looking at the
way that the data out structure
algorithm is going to represent your
data in memory so that's how you fix
something like this you can't you can't
just rely on on a raised you have to
actually go back to the Donald Knuth
data structure or concept go go research
binary trees and linked lists and bucket
eyes linked lists and every other data
structure out there and that's the only
way you make this stuff any faster great
question if you're listening ask more
questions dude you're my new favorite
person on the Internet sure so what's
your story sorry yeah you should just
stay at the mic yeah just just stay
there a great answer so but my question
is would we ever go to that details in
when writing our games because most
often yeah those are like interview
questions and then at some point in time
we do handle them for some prototypes
but when you are building games or
writing applications those are already
solved for us in terms of libraries
massively incorrect so I'm sorry so how
many FML players are in here world of
warcraft EverQuest freerealms stuff like
that clubpenguin to Quebec whatever it's
cool games trafico habbo hotel have a
hotel for trainers in the room okay so
you're playing you're playing an MMO
right so a massive multiplayer online
thing and you're playing a cleric okay
cleric is a healer class and you cast a
spell and this spell says he'll everyone
in a 10-foot radius T now this is a
massive multiplayer game you have 10
million other people on the same server
that you can see which people do you
heal right so there's not a library that
comes with this right so I mean they're
so that that's the
the business representation or that's
the player representation what I'm
saying is so you are a node you are x
and y and there will be a library to map
500 points so map 500 points common to X
and wife so I will just use that library
and then get all the 500 points and see
the collision if that library fits into
your code base key that library fits in
your memory processing patterns if that
library is fast enough if that library
runs on the xbox 360 where your client
happens to be doing processing if that
library is written in Python because
you're actually doing your processing on
a server or if that library is actually
written in JavaScript sooner or later if
you want performant code you got to
write it yeah look also so if you do
actually want a library for this there's
one that I recommend it's called the
approximate nearest neighbor library
aann just look for an library it's
fantastic I first found it when doing a
lot of research on Hugh hop stuff who
was doing texture synthesis work it's
fantastic very cool well yeah inin was a
great answer I had forgot forgotten
about it but similarly in and I presume
of course there will be like because any
any any good way to develop application
is like develop smaller portions of it
like libraries factor them out and then
use them so that anyone else can use it
yeah yeah absolutely yeah so like in and
like libraries something more something
like that but I'm actually gonna
completely knock your Ginga tower over
again in that if you're using an that's
fantastic and it developed in a in a
development environment but we're
actually using in a production there's a
lot of problems because the code that
you actually shipped to your consumer is
never just the library so for instance
how does an track its memory yeah
exactly right well if you're running on
the xbox 360 you damn well better know
because you only have 512 megs of ram
and if an for some reason it's
algorithmic wisdom decides to use 700
megs you're out of luck you actually got
to go back in the depths right more
importantly what if an is leaking memory
right so now you have to actually go in
your C++ code and overload the new
operator and then you see that for some
reason this stuff they mean so basically
you're going to have to go into the
depth of the belly of the beast sooner
or later there's very little
off-the-shelf software that really like
hardcore engineer game developers
respect in terms of like yes this does
its job and it does it on every platform
speed tree is one of the fan
think examples of that those guys run an
amazing simulation on tons of hardware
across everywhere and it runs really
really fast too I really like the the
substance editor from a leg Alec war
algorithmic whatever I've never been
able to pronounce their name but they
also have a great set up there too so a
scale form may be right so so there's
everything's cutting you look okay great
great follow-up though oh we need to
take more tape more bikes together yeah
over there the solution is more mics you
already have two there's just turtles on
whether it's Turtles everywhere there we
go thank you um so way back there was
this idea of drawing something into a
frame buffer and then that was hidden
and then switching it and then in
regular JavaScript I've done this where
you draw into a div whose CSS is not
displayed and then when you're finished
then you switch its its CSS so it is
displayed so if you're drawing into a
canvas is there something in html5
canvas that is equivalent of that yes if
I understand your question correctly so
to take us the back so what we covered
in the map rendering class was that each
64 pixel x 64 pixel part of your map may
have also depth right so there may be 10
images stacked on that single 64 x 64
pixels space in your in your larger map
right because the artist may have come
in with layers and so you're basically
doing 10 draw calls for that vertical
column so right so the way we
accelerated that was we effectively
created off-screen canvas buffers which
are basically just a canvas object that
isn't attached to the DOM and we render
you know so we render the the first 20
by 20 pixels set up into one canvas in
the next canvas in the next canvas and
then when we go back to draw later we
actually handle the canvases as objects
rather than the individual loose price
and then the canvas API actually allows
you in the draw image command
pass a canvas object to it so that's how
we get into that situation so you can
toggle it so if you're basically we're
drawing a canvas to a canvas which i
think is analogous to what you're
mentioning about actually creating a div
and then showing it a little bit later
the draw image API is how you would
display a pre computed atlas onto the
canvas I see so it's more like it's sort
of it's sort of nested rather than
toggling back and forth between two
canvases right yeah yeah so so when you
and Peter probably has a lot of great
visibility of this i'm a horrible html5
programmer um you know when you add an
item to the Dom it's kind of on visible
by default unless you set it that way
when you create an off-screen canvas
it's not visible to the canvas at all
the only way to actually get data back
on the canvas is with the draw image or
draw api's in some form yeah yeah you
don't actually need to create the canvas
as part of the Dom basically you just
create the canvas element attention you
don't even have to worry about it ok I
think you can write another canvas an
image and I believe even a video to of
that damage you know there's you can
even take another canvas right into that
campus we're gonna go over the video
question from last night yeah I didn't
actually get to it's a really good
question but just out here yeah actually
that reminded us yeah another question
from last week's moderator um basically
why are we using just paraphrasing here
why are we using animation instead of
white why don't we use video right we
have pretty animations yeah Colt had a
great answer probably now's a good time
that yeah is that set up for that leads
into it pretty well sure yeah so a great
question I love all these great
questions they're fantastic so the
question was why are we not using video
for animations a couple things here
number one it actually starts with ya
number one it actually starts with the
content creation pipeline right so for
an artist to actually go through and
create frames of a video versus just
loose sprites in adobe photoshop we're
talking 90 day difference here it's
easier for an artist just make these
single frames then pop up
number two is compression right so
typical video codecs actually need good
compression to properly display itself
and so what's going to happen is we're
going to have this little 128 sprite 128
x 128 sprite animation that's actually
going to have compressed artifacts in it
to actually get it onto the web in a
performant manner and number three is
transparency videos don't actually
support transparent pixels that allow us
to blend with the background frame now
we can change some CSS elements and
actually make the entire thing bling
with the background frame but there's
not really a set up unless you know
there's a separate processing engine
that says hey make this pink color
actually transparent and don't draw that
to the screen to my knowledge there's no
api for that in html5 so we actually
could not use a video like like
functionally use a video to play our
animations for that one concept alone
all right cool it's not about the
trimmed image restore this is Emily you
yes okay good we don't want to answer it
get it to Volga why do we need to
calculate the center of the trimmed
image using a different formula why
can't we use the same old formula to
calculate that a great question this is
one of the places where I really have to
applaud the Udacity community there's
been a lot of confusion about sprite
trimming and if you go check out the
forms on that on that quiz there's tons
of great answers and tons of great
information there in fact there's great
there's better dot maybe did better
diagrams that we did quite frankly so
mad props to those guys if you go there
and check it out the short answer to
this I think it's already answered there
but I'll cover it yet again is that
although the sprite dot frame w actually
stores the dimensions of the sprite it
doesn't take into account the fact that
this right may be offset right so if you
always assume that the trimming factor
is always trimming towards the center
then all you have to do is divide by
width and height but if you assume that
the artist might have put this data down
in the lower left hand corner then
dividing by width and height won't
actually give you the true center of the
sprite you also have to take into
account translational offset due to the
trim it and that's why the trimming code
is pretty complex you can't just divide
sure okay next question is from what
I've seen this course seems to be more
of an exploration of grits rather than
actually teaching html5 features
specific game programming is that the
case and if so why so I I really like
this question actually colt is more of a
fan that game programming and
optimization what's your favorite
personal yeah this is this this is my
favorite for standing so personally I
think that one of the best ways to learn
is to build something another great way
to learn is to see how someone else
built something read through their code
see how they thought through the process
is that you're thinking through at the
same time and in that vein I think that
this as an exploration of grits and
seeing how we approach this and also
coding it up yourself you know as we're
going along while also building your own
game is a great way to learn how to
build a game for the internet because it
is a very non-trivial problem so I think
this combination of seeing our code and
working through our code and thinking
about your own projects in your own
games in your own desire to build
something awesome is really why we're
doing this the way we're doing it and
why we are teaching class the way we are
I never follow Catherine yeah you don't
have a follow up yeah actually I
challenged this question too because I
think basically what we're trying to do
with this course is teach you html5
canvas rendering and we're trying to do
it through the lens of game development
and for someone to come to the table and
say all we're doing is talking about
grits I think it's actually a success in
that metric because you don't understand
that you're actually learning John
resins object-oriented prototype set up
and you're actually learning things like
xhr get and how to fetch data from the
internet and how to draw things to the
the screen and you're going to learn
about asset loading and pet and package
management and you're gonna learn about
all these other things that html5 does
but it's all in the context of a game
and so if someone is thinking that all
we're doing is using grits and they're
not learning anything about html5 yet
they have this functioning game at the
end of it I think in my opinion that's a
success we've actually taught someone
html5 just with the right context
and just just to add to that so I
usually a lot of a 25 training and when
we first started out with that we really
took like the different api's and
examples of each API but they were not
really connected and as a result there
was very little learning going on
because I mean all you learned was
canvas and then stroke a line to the
canvas and see what's happening here you
see a lot of different things moving
together that's actually much more
real-life case in fact when we started
the course we looked at let's show we
like the idea was an html5 of course but
you know what to use as an example and
right away there was the game idea and
as I wrong then in that case we may as
well use a game that is much bigger than
just you know build it from scratch atal
game yeah is actually something that
Colt had been working on for MIT with
four or five other people for any office
with a new booth so yeah so I think it
really make sense I would agree to some
extent though that there are a couple of
things in there that are pretty deep
into the game code I mean that's what
you're going to get to to build this
particular use case and I think like we
said before we're also thinking of
already a next part of this course which
would be a server-side course and a
mobile extension on top of that I think
again the gaming tends to take any
platform and really push the limits so
that that's also a reason to do this and
I think you'll find even in the you know
if we we don't have any dates or
anything for that follow-up classes yet
but there's a lot of other concepts
things like web sockets and you know XML
HTTP requests and all of those things I
think it start making a lot of sense for
units that we haven't aired yet they
haven't launched yet we'll talk about
Web Audio that's very relevant I mean
it's pure html5 I would say so anyway
set up just a little extra
oh we should pass this one too the
question is i downloaded grits during
google i/o last year and yesterday i
logged in but that was as far as i could
go when his grits gonna run again by dud
dad in las vegas first off hi dad thanks
for watching my course appreciate you
for that's actually my father leaves the
round of applause to my father logging
in to give me so we when we watched
I gotta answer it like straight face now
so when we launched grits last year we
were actually doing it sort of ninja
stealth mode and actually running our
compute server side on Google compute
engine but it actually wasn't announced
by the time grits launched so we weren't
actually allowed to talk about it in
fact if you watched my google 02 google
i/o talk at the very end of it someone
actually asked me a question it says hey
where are you running your node.js
server and I'm like ah good question i
just moved on because we hadn't actually
announced a google compute engine yet at
that time so it was kind of funny um
google compute engine there they're
doing their stuff under the hood i don't
actually think it's open for public yet
and and so we've been kind of having to
keep asking them for access again
because they'll kind of go through and
say all right well we got it we're going
to unweight list everybody so we'd get
back to our work and unweight this
everybody and so I have to keep putting
in a request be like please give me
access again then I gotta go fix up
everything so it'll run and you know
these guys are still doing a great job
creating this amazing cloud solution for
the future of web computing and I'm I'm
unfortunately chasing the dragon's tail
on that one also chasing the dragon's
tail fun story about my dad a great
shout out to my father when I was
actually growing up he and I actually
used to use video games as sort of the
way we bonded and I actually I like to
attribute the entirety of my career to
those times that my father died used to
sit around playing video games for
ungodly amounts of hours more
importantly when I actually finally
decided that I wanted to make video
games for a living my father and
my mother with a few people that said
yes whatever you need let's go buy you
as many books as you want let's spend as
many hours as we can talking about it
actually remember he took us we all took
a trip to the mountains one time we were
camping and actually printed out pages
and pages and pages of code because we
didn't actually have a computer with us
and I spent the entire camping trick in
in the RV under a light highlighting
code in trying to understand stuff and
and as a father that was one of the
coolest things that I thought he ever
did is he dragged me out to this fishing
trip and let me sit in there and program
all day so uh you know I hope that
everyone in here has a similar story
about how your parents kind of
influenced your dreams and brought you
to where you are in your life because my
father was one of the key influences of
that so thanks for giving me dad
okay um follow-up yeah yeah yeah I'm not
okay it's time to go home how far can we
go in copying concepts from another game
without getting sued what are the things
to pay attention to Ian moving from FPS
tower defense i will copy a single shot
feature where one bill kill bullet kills
the enemy um we're not weird yeah yeah
we are not lawyers yeah I think we're
gonna move on yeah we have no legal
advice that we can give you nor can we
yeah why I strange to over 50 though I
found the YouTube transcripts helpful
but they have haven't been released for
unit to really be forthcoming or is it
something I can do myself on YouTube um
yeah is there actually yeah so the the
transcripts I if those ones aren't
released yet on the wiki I was under the
impression they were so I'll get those
done as soon as i Ken probably tomorrow
something yeah
mmm they're cool we've got a couple more
questions if there's any more questions
from the room you might have thought a
little about it 3n we are you guys left
I don't ask the hard questions man is
there a place where we can get more
background on the image compression in
the calculating of the positions in the
compressed files so i'm addicted to
image compression as an algorithm i
think it's one of the most amazing
things as a computer programmer that you
can dive into it's kind of like it's
kind of like my version of heroin for
programming it's just you keep you want
more in lower files but i don't think
he's actually talking about image
compression here and i think this is
actually talking about the trimming
concepts in compressing out unused space
inside of texture Packer I'm again the
if you want to know more about packing
images into larger images that only take
out bin packing as an algorithm google
for that term and check out my articles
on my blog and my alt dev blog posts
there as well there's there's a lot of
good resources there will the study
group videos be available for download
um I'm yeah they're good be study group
videos are as you may have noticed on
the new destiny youtube channel so this
is being streamed live on the Udacity
youtube channel and sort of overlay also
on google developers live so if you're
not familiar with google developers live
check it out it's a developer google one
and there you'll find so that's our our
TV channel right so we have a chrome
channel if you will where be
broadcasting lots of episodes of for
example the breakpoint with paul irish
and addy Osmani chrome apps shows we
have like one every week office hours
for several technologies we have Ilya
Grigori doing lots of his make the web
fast shows really check that out
incredible content that we make
available there for free and you'll also
find these Udacity study groups sort of
simulcast there and that's basically
just attracted to the Udacity video
stream so yes you can download them
they're not sure why you would do not
maybe just watch them on on YouTube but
yes you you can download them well I
think probably one of the reasons is a
lot of our students are in low bandwidth
areas where it's a lot harder to strain
things continuously so it's easier just
to start a download and come back in a
week yo so so that that's actually true
ok in an earlier study group we were in
treated to contact you directly by an
email address it wasn't visible in the
video and I can't seem to find it could
you make it available ok so if you are
in the course then you should have been
receiving right fairly regular emails if
you respond to that email or if you
check what email address that comes from
it is Sean at Udacity com all of those
emails and it whatever you respond come
back to me so if you have any questions
or comments or feedback or anything like
that please send me an email I get a
torrent of them after every one of those
emails we actually call his facial hair
the feedback beard true story sure yeah
and on that no more this is actually you
have to answer this one okay so that's
right not a question but I was promised
awesomeness so I want more story time
and more blooper reel or as my
two-year-old grandson says I want my
google thank you again dad huh so first
off quick question for the people in the
room how many people find story time and
the blooper reel stuff you guys like
that is a good round of applause you
guys enjoy it and then I bet need this
to you okay so yeah we have a fair
amount of content in terms of blooper
reels up a little bit hours of cold
stuck in a room tiny little room with a
light on the talking to himself it's
fairly entertaining yeah we can totally
get some more of that up the main
problem is bandwidth for our amazing
video team specifically Calvin whoo-hoo
talent he climbs a lot salam he
tolerated all of us really for this
entire time and yeah if we can get some
get some time for him to do that i think
i think it would be a lot of fun we
should definitely put some our blooper
reels up if you want that email calvin
who yeah yeah no don't don't do that
okay okay all right it was really one
more question yeah one more one more
question let's take that yeah wrap it up
oh I think we owe clients pack consumer
responder bonus how can we track items
over so great stuff keep blogging Colton
can you remind people again where they
can find a blog that's not yeah so by
blog is at main roach blogspot com I try
to put corollary stuff in there if you
actually go there now I've actually got
a series of how to do faster canvas
rendering based upon what we've been
talking about the Udacity course there's
going to be more stuff there as the
course unfolds sort of this other
channel of oh by the way I forgot to
talk about this yeah
down down can you please explain how the
items such as the energy canister are
updated for the server so all the client
saw the client see the pack consumed and
then respawn fun us how we could track
the items per google account doing
undercover this I mean I can do it
briefly but do we want too many what
does anyone need to leave right now is
this could go Oh dad got three minutes
ok ok oh yeah so we will cover this in
great detail in the next grits class if
the green experts class manifest itself
but I will go into it very quickly right
now so effectively what occurs is that
we have a nodejs instance that's running
on the server now the reason we chose
nodejs is it so we can actually share
the server so code and the client-side
code next to each other the server code
is actually running a lockstep
simulation with each of the clients
however the clients are actually doing
predictive physics so the server is a
definitive server right so effectively
what happens is all the clients are
doing their little input the input gets
sent up to the server and then the
server will tell the client hey this is
where you move to so the user hits the
arrow key that could set up to the
server the server says it'll process a
physics frame and say hey you moved 5
foot right then that 5-foot location is
actually sent back down to the client
and the client says cool move 5 foot of
course this is going to cause problems
because you've got latency you've got
lag you've got ping and you don't want
to see your little robot actually jitter
its way around the environment because
of this we actually use client-side
prediction which means the client will
say you hit the up arrow it'll send its
command up to the server and then the
client will predict where he's supposed
to be going and actually start moving
you in that direction and render you in
those positions until he gets a pain
back from the server that says the
action accurate corrected position and
then what we'll do is we'll use those
piece two pieces of data the client-side
predicted model and the accurate
server-side model and will slowly
converge them over a number of frames so
what happens is you'll constantly be
getting out of sync with what the server
is doing but you don't notice it because
you're actually only off by a little bit
each frame so how things like the energy
canister play into this is that again
you move to a location and physics box2d
will actually say you have an
intersection but again the server and
the client both have to agree that this
intersection has occurred so what
happens is you move to a location and we
have
client-side only responds to a little
cool doing that there is my forehead we
have a client-side on the response to
the fact that you actually touched your
energy canister but then later on that's
actually validated by the server and the
server will say hey this energy can
deter was touched send these commands
out to all the p2p players that are
actually in the environment so there's
this really beautiful ballet of how
messages are sent back and forth from
the client the server what the code does
is the response to that and it's really
complex and it's really crazy and the
guy who wrote most of that architecture
was actually named Craig tiller he's an
engineer working at Google now but in
his former life he was actually a server
programmer at blizzard working on World
of Warcraft and before that he was
actually a server programmer working a
great company like I Crytek entirely
focusing again on server programming so
Craig is an amazing beast of an engineer
he's also a really really funny guy we
love hanging out with them and there's
there's some really if you go tramping
through the crib crits code base you'll
see lots of just nuggets of wisdom that
you're like how does this work and why
is it running so amazingly and that's
that's all Craig tiller so I mad props
to that guy and again we'll cover this
in the next class if you get all of your
friends to sign up for this one okay all
right so with that we're going to wrap
it up so a couple of final announcements
again the study the contest for the
course have been extended on the website
there's definitely still time to start
that if you haven't and a couple people
in a room like Dan is formal a little
study group sorry a little contest group
within the study group mmm together you
guys yeah that's greater than if you're
looking for people to team up with
especially here in San Francisco there's
probably a good amount of people that
want a team up
if you win this contest and we have
several prizes we have some really cool
stuff if you didn't know this one of the
prizes is a ticket to google i/o they're
pretty hard to get the other one is a
cameo appearance in one of the future of
Udacity training courses which is also a
lot of fun at all expense paid trip up
to a certain amount of yeah and then we
have a bunch of hardware Chromebooks
maybe we'll throw in a game of this
versus that we have the programmer joke
so um next week study group here in San
Francisco's same room same time same
great food and with that I think will
turn it over the video will be available
in recorded form shortly after this of
course and what I thank you thank you
guys really appreciate you thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
