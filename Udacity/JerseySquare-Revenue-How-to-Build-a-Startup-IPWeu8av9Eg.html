we have the teams do and that Jersey
square guys was a great example is to
start to put together you the unit
economics the metrics that matter for
both revenue and cost so they were gonna
take the annual subscription revenue 199
and see what their business looked like
so they assumed that the cost of a
jersey with 25 percent off to them that
is to Jersey square was 150 dollars they
think they'll be able to rent it five
times during the year that their
shipping cost was about nine dollars
they're cleaning cost a dollar
processing cost a dollar and their
customer acquisition that is a customer
acquisition and activation cost twenty
five dollars a team and and so if you
take a look at their unit cost you add
all this up it's two hundred and thirty
dollars but their revenue was only 199
why would they do this because they were
going to lose thirty one dollars a year
well remember this is to acquire a
customer but what you need to look at is
the customer lifetime value what happens
when this customer renews for the next
year well in the next year you don't
have that Jersey cost because you're
still turning that Jersey
he might have only used it two or three
or four times and you don't have the
customer acquisition cost because you
already acquired that customer you still
have your shipping cleaning and
processing costs but your unit costs are
now fifty five dollars and if you get
sixty percent retention your net for
those customers now who stay longer than
a year is $86
now you could immediately see some of
the fallacies in in these first
back-of-the-envelope calculations is
well what if they use the Jersey 7 times
in a year you're actually buying more
jerseys per year and actually you're
losing money in your two three and four
so you might want to be limiting the
number of times you can actually rent
the Jersey in a year or you could just
be changing your revenue model but this
is a good visual way to start thinking
about how to start doing the math for
metrics that matter</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
