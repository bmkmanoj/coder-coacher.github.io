question we have from the forums is are
the tools Lex and yak that we use
throughout lecture and in the homeworks
used outside of the classroom it's a
good question Peter actually the answer
is a resounding yes a number of times in
the real world as well as in my research
career I have used tools like the lexer
and parser generators we're learning
about in this class programming
languages and it turns out that there's
effectively a standard this notion of
making lexical analyzers are making
parsers it's so common it's so popular
that there's support for it for almost
every language the original tool for
this was called Lex a lexical analyzer
generator and the name in there
generator is important the idea was you
would just write out some regular
expressions and this tool would
automatically make the finite state
machine the lexical analyzer for you
saving you a lot of time and grungy
implementation work of converting
regular expressions down to finite state
machines was called the lexical analyzer
generator but it was proprietary
software at the time and it only worked
for C similarly there were many attempts
to make compilers or interpreters so it
was really important to be able to write
down a context-free grammar and spit out
a parser something that would recognize
the language and make an abstract syntax
tree or a parse tree so there were a
number of so-called compiler compilers
tools that would allow you to write your
own compiler and one of the most famous
was known as yet another compiler
compiler or yak both Lex and yak were
proprietary software so the good new
project made free versions of them
called flex a fast lexical and lexical
analyzer generator and bison byeson
being a pun on yak which were then very
widely used now initially they only
supported the languages C and C++ but as
time has gone by you can find them for
many other languages so for example Ruby
a scripting language a bit like Python
as Ruby Lex and Ruby yack Python has
things like PL y Java has similar tools
Cup as an example of one of them Oh
camel a language near and dear to my
heart that you may know as Microsoft's F
sharp has Oh camel exa no camel yak so
exactly the same sorts of ideas you
write out a regular expression and then
some code to do you right out of grammar
and then for each rule you write out how
to build up the abstract syntax tree
that's exactly the same format that are
used in the lexical analyzer and parser
generator tools for all of the other
languages so the techniques that you're
learning in this class really carry over
directly the next time you want to make
a little scripting language you can use
exactly the same sorts of things we've
learned here so yes I end the real world
use more or less exactly these tools
depending on exactly the language we're
targeting</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
