a car that drives when it sees a green
light but it doesn't do anything
specific when it doesn't see a green
light like when the light is yellow or
red and for safety we want to tell it to
stop whenever that is like green
condition is false and Java gives us an
easy way to do this with an else
statement an else statement can only
come after an if statement and it lets
us provide an alternate set of
instructions to follow for when the if
test condition is not met using these
together is called an if-else statement
and it gives two possible decision
pathways for our computer to take and
actually the if-else statement is often
compared to how humans make decisions
like in this case I might describe our
driving decision as if the light is
green I'll Drive otherwise I'll stop and
an else statement is the code equivalent
of saying otherwise so based on the
value of our boolean variable is like
green our computer will make a decision
to execute code contained in the if
statement when is like green is true or
in the else statement when is like green
is false it will never execute both
blocks of code so let's see how to write
an else statement here's our else
statement instead of having no code
after our if statement we just write
else after the end of the ifs closing
curly brace and then the code we want to
execute in the else will be surrounded
by curly braces
notice that the else statement has no
test condition associated with it like
the if does and now if the light is not
green we want our car to stop driving so
let's print out that option stop in the
else now let's try this code out with a
signed boolean values if is like Green
is true our if test condition will be
satisfied and our code will print out
Drive otherwise if it's false this will
fail our if test condition and go into
our else statement block of code instead
and this will print out stop so again
only one of these blocks of code will be
executed when you run this code either
the code in the if or the code in the
else but I bet you're wondering what if
the traffic light is yellow or flashing
we'll need more than just two decision
pathways
take next we'll see how to construct
even more pathways</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
