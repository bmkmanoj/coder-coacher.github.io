let's talk about signatures I mentioned
such a bit authorities earlier and the
job is to scientist indicates but what
does it mean and why would anyone want a
signed certificate when we say someone
has signed a document we mean that the
certificate authority has reviewed and
verified the contents of that document
the purpose is to have some kind of
proof that document was seen or even
created by that entity just like signing
your name on a document is legal proof
that you saw the document a server can
do the same thing with a digital
signature when a server signs a document
and encrypts it with their private key
they give that bag as a signed document
since only the holder of the private key
is able to encrypt documents you know
the document you received is exactly the
same as the one the server sent however
documents can become fairly large think
of DVD images for example and encrypting
and decrypting takes a long time with
asymmetric ciphers that's why instead of
encrypting the entire document itself
just the hash of the document is
encrypted if you want to check if the
signature is valid you will decrypt the
signature and hash the document yourself
to see if those two values match this
way we know that the document who
received is exactly the same as when the
server sent it if the document was
changed mid-flight the hash would not
match the one provided by the server at
his signature this is called an invalid
signature</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
