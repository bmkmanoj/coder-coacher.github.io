subjective but to me it's clear that
showing that sat is np-complete what's
the hardest thing that we had to do
because we didn't know any other problem
to be np-complete so we had to go
through a lot of effort to show that any
problem in NP can be expressed as a
boolean formula for Sat then I think
that showing clique to be np-complete
was the next difficult thing because
it's not really obvious how you can
reduce a to click because Sat is a
problem boolean formulas clique is a
problem on graphs and so we had to find
a good idea to show how sad can be
reduced to click and then in the first
unit it still took some thought but
showing how vertex cover clique and
independent set are related wasn't that
difficult because all three problems
were asking questions about graphs and
they were asking mostly very similar
questions especially clique and
independent set vertex cover yeah we had
to give it a little thought but I still
think it was much easier than coming up
with the idea of how to encode a boolean
formula into a graph that is then an
input for clique so the good news is the
hardest part is over but of course as
you've seen with sat and clique showing
NP completeness can still be tough and
that is why I would like to show you one
more example of a reduction for a quite
famous and P complete problem that you
don't know yet and then give you some
more general strategies on how you can
show NP completeness for other problems
and to introduce that problem to you I
would like you to meet Dave</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
