we look at CPUs and memory certain
things are relatively less complicated
in spite of everything that we said so
far because there is a significant level
of standardization at the instruction
set architecture across the front
platforms so then from a virtualization
standpoint we know that we have to
support a specific I sub and then we
don't care if there are lower level
differences between the hardware because
it's up to the hardware manufacturers to
be standardized at the iso level this
clearly is the case for a particular i
so for instance for x86 things will be
different across x86 and for instance
mips platforms when we look at devices
however there is a much greater
diversity in the types of devices if we
compare that to the types of cpu
instruction sets and also there is lack
of standardization when it comes to the
specifics of the device interface and
the semantics of that interface what is
the behavior when a particular call is
is invoked how a particular device
should respond to a call to send the
packet for instance to deal with this
diversity virtualization solutions adapt
one of three key models to virtualize
devices we will describe these models
next and a note that they were developed
before any virtualization friendly
hardware extensions were made to the CPU
architectures end up chipsets and these
are new modifications of the hardware
make some aspects of device
virtualization much simpler than than
what originally it was when these models
were first introduced</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
