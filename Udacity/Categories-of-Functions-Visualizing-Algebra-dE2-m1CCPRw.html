and why these different categories of
two dimensions and three dimensions well
we first looked at this overarching or
broad category called shapes we think of
shape as being made up of curves and
straight lines connected at points or
vertices then we looked at how we could
find differences between those shapes
two-dimensional and three-dimensional we
were wondering are the shapes flat or
not and from that single question we
were able to make these two categories
about our shapes well this is also true
about functions we use functions to
describe particular relationships in
math for this unit we're going to focus
on polynomials expressions with
constance with linear terms quadratic
terms or cubic terms are all considered
to be part of polynomials constants are
numbers like 3 negative 4 or 5 halves
linear turns contain a single variable
with an exponent of 1 we don't have to
write the 1 as the exponent because we
assume that's the case a linear term
might have constant terms on it or not
but it's the variable with the exponent
of one that makes it linear quadratic
polynomials contain an x squared and
cubed polynomials they contain a cube or
a third power for this unit we won't
focus on the graphs of polynomials we're
going to focus on working with them so
adding subtracting multiplying and
dividing them you might be wondering
what some of these other functions are
they include square roots and
Exponential's but don't worry about
these we'll get to them later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
