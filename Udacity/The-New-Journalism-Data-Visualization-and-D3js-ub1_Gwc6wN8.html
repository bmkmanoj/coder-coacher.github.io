traditional journalism approaches
creating stories and crafting narratives
I wanted to contrast it with the new
approaches that data journalism takes to
create engaging and often interactive
visualizations traditionally journalists
have used data and charts as evidence to
support a claim often in the form of a
static image embedded within a larger
body of text for example you might be
reading a news article that uses a chart
to support some claimant makes in the
overall narrative I say here data around
narrative to refer to the fact that the
narrative is the focus of the
journalistic piece and the data merely
exists in a secondary and supporting
role data journalism on the other hand
places the data front and center and
build a narrative around the data for
example a data journalist might have
some interesting data set and try to
tell a story about what's happening in
that data set in comparison to an
article that has a static chart embedded
to support claims made a data journalist
might have an interactive chart which
they then use labels annotations and
sidebars to add context to the data and
by adding context of the data they'll
create a narrative around the story they
want to tell with their chart the second
difference I want to point out that
traditional journalism often present its
information as a sequence of events a
then B then C to create a linear
narrative their journalism on the other
hand leverages interactivity 10 able
much more complex and varied narrative
structures allowing the user to discover
their own data story possibly from going
from event a to event C back to event a
may be going to some external article or
other information Z which leads back to
conclusion B
in this case the structure of the story
and the narrative it tell may be
different and customized for every
reader whereas in traditional journalism
you might write a single story with a
single linear flow so no matter who's
reading it the story stays the same and
the last aspect I want to compare was
the method of delivery or dissemination
traditional journalism is published
either in a physical form like a
newspaper or magazine or on the web but
often only as static HTML thought of
like a digital book the new
visualizations coming out of data
journalism outlets like the New York
Times or 538 leverage many of the open
web technologies that we discussed in
lesson one to create both more
accessible articles and also interactive
visualizations than enable much richer
interaction from the reader</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
