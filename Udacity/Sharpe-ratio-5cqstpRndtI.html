return for risk and it enables us in a
quantitative way to assess each of these
example compared portfolios so sharp
ratio will show us for instance that in
this case ABC is better because it has
about the same volatility as XYZ but
higher return if it were to assess these
two even though they both have the same
return it'll say X Y Z is better because
it's got lower risk and finally in this
case where these two are very close and
it's hard for us as humans to determine
which one is better
sharp ratio will give us a number that
will help us determine between the two
so with regard to the numbers at Sharpe
ratio ends up providing us all else
being equal lower risk is better higher
return is better Sharpe ratio also
considers something called the risk-free
rate of return
that's the interest rate you would get
on your money if you put it in a
risk-free asset like a bank account or a
short-term Treasury the reason that it
includes this number is we always need
to consider gee maybe this asset we've
got isn't performing as well as the
return I would get if I just put it in
the bank now lately as of mid-2015 the
risk-free rate of return is about zero
in other words if you were to put your
money in the bank or divert by very
short-term Treasury bonds that's the
interest rate they would pay you and
this is why lately folks have put so
much money into the stock market because
you can't make money putting your money
in the bank these days the Sharpe ratio
is named for William Sharpe and he
developed something called the Sharpe
ratio that accounts for all of these now
think about what the form of that
equation would look like</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
