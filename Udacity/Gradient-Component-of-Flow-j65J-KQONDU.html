I've written it both ways just the
original the way using the gradient
imagery dot product way or in the
algebraic way question how many unknowns
and how many equations per pixel the
number of unknowns is easy what was I
trying to solve for u and V right u and
V is which way is this point moving
great how many equations well yes there
are two equations up there but they're
the same equation I have two unknowns
but only one equation per pixel this
should bother you alright it's very hard
to solve things that you've got twice as
many unknowns as you have equations
because remember I have a different U
and V possibly for every pixel so I've
got two times the number of pixels
unknowns and I've got one equation per
pixel two times the number of pixels
what's going on here so intuitively we
can think about what this constraint
means as follows the component of U V
that's in the direction of the gradient
that's what we can measure right that
mount will tell us how much the image
will change that's why that's the amount
of I T I sub T the derivative all right
so what this is saying is if this is the
direction of our gradient as indicated
here right here suppose this is my real
UV right there well any other UV that
has a component of the same amount in
the direction but I've got a u prime V
Prime
that's in an extra component that's
parallel to the edge alright and this
new vector here which was the original u
the plus u prime V prime it has the same
amount perpendicular to the edge and in
the direction of the gradient but a
different amount along the edge remember
when we were doing corner finding and we
put up the thing we said well if you
slide it up and down
I'm throughout if if your little patches
on the edge of the black square if we
slide it up and down we can't tell at
all we can only tell how much is being
moved perpendicular to the edge
that's what's going on here locally we
can only tell the amount of motion that
is perpendicular to the edge in a little
area when you think about this little
area you can think of like looking
through a little hole remember from our
talk about cameras that that's called an
aperture and this general problem this
is called the aperture problem</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
