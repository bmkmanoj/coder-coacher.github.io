lot of questions about my sequel and
post grads and why you prefer postgrads
to my sequel why other people prefer my
sequel all at a time so if you could
answer some of those it'd be great yes
yes so we'll start the first question
which is why i prefer postgres over my
sequel and this is a two-part answer
back in 2005 when we started reddit I
was I was basically where you are now
which is just learning how web apps work
and I was trying to install all this
stuff on my computer and I started
installing my sequel in Postgres and my
sequel wouldn't compile on my mac and
postcards would so that's good reason
well I mean actually to be fair it says
a lot about a project like if it built
on my Mac it'll probably build just
about anywhere because at the time what
sex was still fairly new um so that's
how we started with postgres my sequel
at the time was still very popular it's
far more popular in Postgres but it had
a reputation for being a little lossy
with data this is maybe the right word a
little inconsistent postgrads the
documentation was better the they were
they would sacrifice you know kind of
functionality over stability and
consistency and and adherence to kind of
a sequel standard and some queries that
we did on reddit that kind of pushed the
limits of these databases ran much much
faster and post guards down on my sequel
so I've just been loyal ever since these
days feature for feature they're
basically the same my sequel is not
nearly so you know I'll go there with
you have and a lot of people use my
sequel so at this point it's whichever
you prefer maybe go back to whichever
compiles easier on your computer is a
perfectly acceptable reason these days I
think okay we also had some questions
about other types of databases why no
sequel databases were popular why a lot
of companies are moving to that you
mentioned that Facebook uses my sequel I
believe and we had some questions about
them using no sequel as well okay sure
so yeah no sequel is basically a
reaction to the difficulties of
developing with sequel databases one of
the challenges with sequel databases is
you have to define your tables ahead of
time you have to know what your columns
are going to be you have to know what
the types
but when you're writing a web software
one of the advantages of writing web
software is you don't have to think
everything through an advance you can
get something working you can put it
online you can see all users react to it
you can kind of iterate from there you
know add new features take pictures
weight and whatever you want to do the
challenge is when you have databases and
a large amount of data you have to
sometimes you know add a new column or
add a new index or you know add a bunch
of new data types when you have a
database in production that has
thousands or millions of users this can
be really painful so these no sequel
databases generally they try to solve
that problem they make it another way to
describe that would be schema list
databases the database don't have a
schema that is they don't have a formal
description of columns and data types
and it's neat on reddit we kind of built
our own kind of scheme Ellis system on
top of postgres and we actually do the
same thing again at hit mom because it's
a nice way of working the challenge
right now a lot of these scheme Ellis
databases is they're not very good you
know they are there they're brand new
technology databases are really hard so
they have stability problems they you
know documentation is lacking you know
that there's not very many of them are
used in the wild and production so you
don't have kind of you know good support
and people to lean on that sort of thing
so in my opinion it's still wise
especially when it comes to data
especially if you care about your data
to stick with something that's proven
that works that you know how to scale
you know everybody's worked with
postcards of my sequel for a long time
now so those things worked very very
well now as for facebook they used I
don't work at Facebook so I'm not
necessarily not 30 on this subject but I
know they use a lot of my sequel they've
actually made a lot of improvements to
my sequel and they also wrote their own
no sequel system called Cassandra which
my understanding although I don't know
for sure is they don't actually use
anymore ready use this cassander
incidentally they started using that
after I left however and I can't say
with the clear conscience that I condone
that decision but apparently it's
working for them in production so you
know your mileage may vary personally I
i'm happy with postgres i know how to
scale at these days and you can you can
get away with kind of scheme Ellis
behavior
in Postgres by just storing you know one
column that's like a big wad of JSON for
example that actually works really well
depending on what problem is you're
solving so anyway that's a long answer
to a simple question but uh that that's
that's that's that's my opinion okay
