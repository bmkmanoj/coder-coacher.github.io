sections of Xcode I went up to help and
then clicked on documentation and
started typing in Xcode overview and the
resulting help page provided a lot of
good detail including what the names of
these different sections within Xcode
are actually called by the way an online
version of this document is also
available in the instructor notes now if
I go back to my Xcode project we can see
that Xcode is divided into three main
sections the Navigator on the left the
editor in the middle of the screen and
the utility on the right now the
Navigator as the name suggests allows us
to browse through files here you can see
that we are making this app for iOS 8 we
are building this on iPhone and the
device orientation of the phone is
portrait landscape left and landscape
right for the sake of simplicity however
I will only choose portrait as the
device orientation Xcode created a few
files for us by default one of which is
called viewcontroller.swift let's check
this one out by the way this code may be
a little bit too small for you to read
so let me make it a little bit bigger
that's much better
notice that this file says that it was
created by Udacity now this for you is
probably the name that you entered under
organization while you were making this
app we are going to begin to write code
in this file in just a few minutes for
now I will click on main dot storyboard
in the navigator now you will notice
that Xcode likes a lot of real estate
and these three buttons here at the
top-right are very helpful with managing
that real estate for instance this
button helps us show and hide the
navigator
this button right next to it helps us
show and hide the debug area and this is
the place where you actually see error
messages and the final button here will
show and hide utilities ok back to the
main dot storyboard here is where we
will actually draw the things that our
user will see on the app it is empty for
now but by the time we are done making
this app this is what the storyboard
will look like these storyboards can get
really elaborate for instance here is a
screenshot of what the storyboard for
the U dash
the iPhone app looks like now one thing
to notice here is that this box on your
screen almost looks like a square if
you've done some work with objective-c
another language which is used to make
iphone apps you will notice that this is
new we can change the way this box looks
by changing the width and height
settings here at the bottom of the
screen they currently say any which
means that this layout works for both
iPhones and iPads since I'm making this
app for the iPhone I can change the
layout here great this looks a little
bit more like the phone now Xcode has a
lot of other helpful features that we
will explore while making that app for
instance we will talk about these
buttons on the left the cluster of these
three buttons here on the right and if I
pull out the utility area you'll also
talk about these buttons here if you're
curious about any of these buttons right
now you can look at the handout that we
have provided in the instructor notes
before I end this tour I have a
challenge for you I want you to explore
Xcode and see if you can figure out a
way to run the current version of our
app in a simulator inside your computer
once you're done with that I want you to
see if you can figure out how to check
the CPU and memory usage for our app as
a quick hint the answer is somewhere in
the documentation listed in the
instructor notes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
