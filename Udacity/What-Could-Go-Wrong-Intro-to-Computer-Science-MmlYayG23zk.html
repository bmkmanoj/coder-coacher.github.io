to a file and we can pass in a string so
that we'll write the line import this to
the file wimp I in the current directory
when we're done with a file we should
always remember to close it and the
reason we want to close files is
operating systems do lots of strange
things with files to try to maintain
them to buffer them the changes that we
think we made with our program might not
actually be there if we don't close it
it also might cause problems if they're
open file handles left that weren't
closed when the program executed so we
should close the file after we're done
with it so now we'll have a quiz to see
if you can think about all the things
that could possibly go wrong with this
code the choices are the calls it open
fails if the current directory is not
writable the call to write fails if the
disk is full a cosmic ray hits the
processor at the wrong time changing the
string from import this to import thus
there's a power outage before the F out
close completes leaving the file in a
corrupted state check all the ones that
could possibly go wrong</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
