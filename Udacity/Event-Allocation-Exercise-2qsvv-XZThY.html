been talking about and put in our list
affect the different concurrently
executing sub machines that we have
already modeled see if you can figure
out which one's of these which ones
these are and label the transitions in
the finite state machine with their
numbers so so pick pick a particular
event and decide which of the state
machines are affected by that particular
event happening starting with number 14
turning the dial for the frequency that
would be affecting our see our station
of finite state Monsieur so we would now
expect as a in that particular machine
the station knob machine that the arc
that we have the self arc that we have
is going to be labeled by a particular
event which is event number 1 ok simple
right and we can do the same thing for
some of these other other events and
come up with a an annotated diagram or a
diagram in which the transitions all
have arcs on them in our particular this
particular exercise we don't have any
spontaneous transitions the spontaneous
and transition is where you're in some
state and you go to the next state
without any event happening ok so we
ultimately going to see that we're going
to need to have for each of the arcs
that we have in the diagram some event
causing the transition and remember that
our arrows with two heads on them are
really an abbreviation for two arrows
one going in each direction so i think
we meant event for for the event one I
think is changing the volume so that
would be the volume dial state machine
but for this one we're talking about ok
so with the transition we're putting on
the station knob self transition is for
event for here are the additions to our
machine to handle events 1 2 3 4 12 and
13 so with respect to event one that's
the volume knob that's similar to our
station one for switching the band
between am and FM those are events 2 and
3 1 going to the left and one going to
the right and similarly
lighting the mode switch to the right
and left our events 12 and 13</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
