bit tricky so let's walk through it
together I'll assign age to the X
parameter and then I'll sign females /
males to the Y parameter this will give
me my ratio and then I just need to make
sure that i passed my newest data frame
to data will add a geo mine to connect
the points and then we'll also add a
horizontal line this gom h line will
take a couple parameters will set the
y-intercept to one the alpha equal to
0.3 and the line type equal to 2 running
this code we get our ratio plot we can
easily see that for very young users the
median female user has over two and a
half times as many friends as the median
mail user clearly it was helpful to
condition on age and understanding the
relationship of gender with friend count
this helped assure us that this pattern
is robust for users of many different
ages and it also highlighted where this
difference is most striking now there
are many processes that can produce this
difference including the bias
distribution from which the pseudo
facebook data was generated one idea
which shows the complexity of
interpretation here is that people from
particular countries who more recently
joined facebook are more likely to be
male with lower friend counts</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
