scene we had a moving car and a moving
dog but of course really we want all the
dogs and cars to move one way of doing
that would be instead of just making one
corn dog move to put all the cars and
dogs into an ArrayList of movable
objects but you might say we already
have an ArrayList of drawables can we
reuse that we can but we have to learn
it a bit more about working with types
in Java let's I have a drawable what I'd
like to know is if it's also a moveable
the instance off test gives me the
answer to that this expression is true
if D happens to belong to a class that
also implements the moveable interface
of course in that case I'd like to then
call the move method but not so fast I
can't call D dot move because V is not
moveable I have to convert thee to
something that is moveable here's how
you do that in Java this expression
means take D and cast it into a moveable
you've previously seen the cast notation
to change a floating point number into
an integer it's the same notation but
now with an interface type once it is
immovable then we can save it in a
variable of type moveable and then we
can invoke the move method on M again
you couldn't have invoked move on D
because D doesn't have a move method
it's a drawable this conversion is
necessary what if you make a cast of
something that wasn't movable such as a
house then you would get an exception
and your program or terminate that's why
it's important that we first check
whether D in fact is movable these
instance of tests and casts are not very
common but they do happen ever so often
and it's good to be familiar with them
so go ahead and put this to work in the
scene program go through all of the
drawables find out which of them are
movable and move them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
