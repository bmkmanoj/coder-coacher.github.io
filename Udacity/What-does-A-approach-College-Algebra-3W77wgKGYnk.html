times 1 plus R over N to the NT we've
seen n the number of times the interest
is compounded in a year equal to several
different values in our different
situations we've had n equals 1 2 3 4
and 12 and presumably we could have
interest compounded even more frequently
than this as you've experienced grant
likes to push limits in order to
maximize the amount of money he makes
and now he wants to know what would
happen if his interest is compounded so
frequently that it was actually
compounded over and over again all the
time lucky for him this sort of interest
set up actually already exists it's
called continuously compounded interest
if we want to use our good old formula
here and keep increasing and increasing
n do I reach a particular function let's
see what happens if we substitute in the
values p equals 1 R equals 1 and T
equals one and then increase the value
of n well if we just set p equal to 1 R
equal to 1 and T equal to 1 here's what
we have a equals 1 plus 1 over N all to
the nth power now I'd like us to see
what happens if we let n increase let's
plug in some values to find out so
here's a little table for you to help me
fill out for each value of n here please
plug it into this equation to find the
value of a that goes with it now you're
probably going to get some pretty long
decimals so I'd like you to type in as
many numbers as your calculator will
give you may be around 10 or so remember
you can always use that google
calculator online if you need a
different device</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
