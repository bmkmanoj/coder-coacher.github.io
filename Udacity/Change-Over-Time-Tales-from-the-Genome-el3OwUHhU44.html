important trait in fact it defines an
entire group in the animal kingdom
called mammals which we are mammals are
defined as a group of animals that can
breastfeed their young with breast milk
and this is possible because we have a
lactase gene that transcribed and
translated into the lactase protein
which is able to metabolize lactose
found in breast milk and breast milk is
one of the best sources of nutrients for
newborn babies but eventually we grow up
and we grow out of drinking breast milk
in on to solid foods this process this
transition from going from breast milk
to solid food is something we call
weaning and there are lots of changes
that happen when an animal actually is
weaned off of breast milk and one of the
most important change is relevant to
what we're talking about is that that
lactase gene turns off however a recent
mutation at least an evolutionary sense
allows the lactase gene to stay turn on
which allows us to drink lactose
products throughout our life for example
milk this mutation or change in the DNA
sequence I want you to tell me if you
think it actually occurs in the coding
region of the lactase gene or the
non-coding regions of the lactase gene
go ahead and pick which answer you think
is best and put in your best reason in
the text box here don't worry about
getting the text box answer right or
wrong just give it your best shot</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
