into programming and even engineering
was that it was an area that I never
thought was actually like important to
me as a person growing up with a very
strong art backer and I went to an arts
high school like my mother is an artist
my grandmother's an artist like I just I
never really realized like off the bat
like how applicable it is like nowadays
like I'm so I tie the two together I am
I make large paintings that have
circuits embedded into the canvas and I
use in our Drina which I program so that
it can do sequence of like different
light displays at the time or like I'll
use like capacitive sensors which I can
like program like and tweak like how old
they can work and what distances and
these are things that like me a couple
years ago would have been like oh wait I
didn't even know I could do this this is
like a whole new form of art and
anything that's one of the things is
that people don't initially think like
oh you know someone's programming
they're just sitting at a computer but
like even the way that you program is an
art like you can be so meticulous about
it like the same work ethic that I use
towards making like a painting it's the
same one I use towards programming and
it's something that like the two are so
entwined for me that I can't see how
like it wouldn't be for other areas like
I have friends that are writers and it's
also the same kind of they have the same
kind of feelings towards it as well and
it's like it's something that we're even
now like if I'm doing like an
interactive art piece or I want to do a
simulation like that's an art in itself
and like to sit down and like program
with like openframeworks or something
and um like that's just something that
like for me is like how could you not
want to think that these two go together
like they totally go together</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
