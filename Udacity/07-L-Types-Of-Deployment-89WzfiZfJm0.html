reason or is released to the same
audience the different places where your
applications can live are called
environments when you are developing
your application locally and testing it
on your localhost you are using your
development environment at this stage
your application has not yet been
deployed you are testing and you are
adding features of your app to ensure it
does what it's supposed to this is also
where you fix the majority of bugs now
what you may think of as deploying can
actually be broken down into two kinds
of deployment staging and production
environments let's cover the more
straightforward one first production
deploying to a production environment is
making your app available to your users
the production environment is configured
for your code to be hosted on a server
hosting on a production environment is
meant to be the end goal you can think
of this as the gallery opening the final
product that is released for the world
to see but what if you've been testing
our application locally and you fixed
all the bugs but you still want to see
what the experience will be like for
your users before you release the
production in this common scenario you
would instead deploy to a staging
environment the staging environment is
like making the final changes of your
gallery a dress rehearsal before the
live release staging can be and often
should be very similar to the production
environment that is ready for end-users
however the staging environment includes
additional tests and often some sample
data most importantly the application
deployed to a staging environment is
meant to be accessed by yourself your
developer collaborators beta testers but
not the end user the process of working
on a development environment and
deploying to a staging and then to a
production environment is sometimes
called the deployment pipeline there are
many tools that allow for a development
team to optimize this pipeline to keep a
consistent stream of urgent updates to
the applications like automatically
deploying to staging after every get
push or running a final set of tests
before releasing to production keeps the
deployment pipeline in mind when you
deploy an application especially as your
applications grow more complicated</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
