think he when I asked about the
model-view-controller he got into more
details that I was really expecting but
that's perfectly ok but he did show that
he understands the basic principles of
the what are the responsibilities of the
model the views and the controller so
that's something that he did quite well
something that I liked a lot is that he
actually has he follows several
well-known blogs or newsletters he is
planning to go to a conference and most
important of all at least for me is that
he has his own side project that he's
working on his learning things that are
from a different field in iOS developers
some developments something that is very
specific to gains that not everybody is
interested but he's looking into that
finding ways to apply to whatever
application is writing right now so that
shows that he has passion he's a total
nerd so that's certainly a plus that's
the kind of person that we're looking
for what he could improve well when I
asked about a core data I asked about
ns-managed object and he talked about
Anna's managed object context which is
slightly different so i'm not sure if he
understood my question or if it was a
clever strategy to talk about something
else and hide that maybe you don't know
that so well if it is the latter I
wouldn't worry too much about this it's
a junior position so I'm not expecting
him to know everything about iOS
development me his knowledge of core
data is not as sound and solid as it
should but that's workable that's
something that you you can work on and
you can fix it but I believe that
whatever code he brings your code base
should work it shouldn't break things
and it should be a useful contribution</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
