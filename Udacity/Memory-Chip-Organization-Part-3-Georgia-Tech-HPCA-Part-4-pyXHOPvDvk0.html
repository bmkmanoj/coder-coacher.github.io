obviously we need to change one of the
cells how do we do that we use the row
address to select the row of the cell
but we can only select a whole row of
cells we cannot just select an
individual cell so if this is bit number
seven in our 32-bit word we select the
address of the world and then we want to
supply a bit here let's say a1 to be
written here so how do we do that
because we can only select a whole row
once we select the row all of the cells
get connected to the bit lines we can
maybe drive the bit line for this one to
write the one but that would lose us
these bits so the way the write needs to
happen is we use the row address select
the row read out these bits the sense
amp amplifies them and we latch them
into the row buffer now we write this
bit to the row buffer at this position
and now we write the whole thing back
into the cells the cells lost their
values when we did the read anyway we
would have to write the values back
anyway before we do that we make all the
rights that we want to that row and then
send them back so that when we are
writing we end up writing 1 1 1 and this
bit is changed to 1 so a right in
theorem is also a read and then write
