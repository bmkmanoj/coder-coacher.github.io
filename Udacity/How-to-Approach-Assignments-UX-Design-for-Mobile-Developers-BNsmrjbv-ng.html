let's talk a bit about how to approach
these assignments most of these
questions won't have a correct answer
rather than asking you to choose the
correct definition of user experience
we're actually going to ask you to do
some design we're also going to ask a
lot of questions or the only output from
you to us is your response to the
question did you do this now obviously
the purpose of a question like this is
not to prevent plagiarism the assumption
here is you are in this course you want
to learn how to improve your design
skills and anyways if you are actually
enrolled in the class
your final grade of pass or no pass will
be based only on your final project so
the purpose of a question like this is
really to help you keep track of the
questions you've answered and which ones
you haven't you get that nice little
orange bubble filled in somewhere up
here in the navigation when you've
completed a question and another part of
the reason why we asked these questions
is for us and for the continued
improvement in this class we want to
know if the people taking this class are
doing the assignments we're also going
to ask you to submit to the forum quite
a bit and let me actually talk about
that a bit more so working on this
course with Nas Bowl and this bill has
been awesome
pretty early into the design of this
class we realized that the design
process that we at Udacity have sort of
converged on over the last few years is
essentially identical to the design
process that nozman Isabel advocate for
in the world of software one example of
this in lesson 4 you're gonna learn how
to take the things that Android can do
really well and leverage those
opportunities to make amazing
experiences for your users but more
generally what I think's going on here
is you should know as a designer what
you are uniquely positioned to do well
no matter what you're designing and then
you should do that thing well in these
massive classes that we've been making
for a while now
we've realized that one thing we are
uniquely positioned to do well is
leverage this amazing massive body of
soozee astok diverse intelligent
students who are all thinking and doing
projects about the same sort of stuff
and that's that's a really huge learning
opportunity so when we ask you to write
something down or share something in the
forum that's that's why we want you to
not only learn from the writing
experience itself but to share that with
other students and read what other
students have to say this this sort of
social learning is a really potentially
important part of the online learning
experience</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
