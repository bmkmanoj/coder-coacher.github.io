connection with human cognition as well
analogical reasoning in general is
considered to be a core process of
cognition but analogical reasoning
depends upon a spectrum of similarity at
one end of the spectrum are problems
which are identical to previously
encountered problems in that case we
simply have to retrieve the previous
solution and apply it at the other end
of the spectrum are problems which are
semantically very dissimilar from
previously encountered problems we'll
discuss those problems later in the
class in the middle of the spectrum of
problems which are similar but not
identical to previously encountered
problems so now we need to retrieve the
past solutions tweak them and apply them
it is this middle of the spectrum which
is most common in human cognition again
going back to a cognitive architecture
which had three components reasoning
learning and memory learning the
recording cases shifted the balance from
reasoning to learning and memory case we
squeezed they can contrast unifies the
three of them it says learning is
important because we need to acquire in
store experiences memory is important
because we need to be able to retrieve
those experiences when needed and
reasoning is important because we need
to be able to tweak those experiences to
encounter the needs of new problems</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
