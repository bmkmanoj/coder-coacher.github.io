Cara Katie what did we be done in this
unit we've learned so much we've come so
far we've learned three supervised
classification algorithms and we've also
learned a lot of things that are more
higher level than just the algorithms
themselves we've learned about bias and
variance these are two extremely
important ideas and machine learning
we've learned about overfitting we've
learned about the parameters how you can
take an algorithm and make it look
completely different just using the
parameters we've covered a lot of
material that sounds so amazing so when
you get to it like in seven setback what
really makes a great machine learning
researcher a great machine learning
researcher is someone who's really
excited and curious and adventurous and
they have a lot of questions and they
really want to answer them and what it
does when you have this attitude is it
makes you go out and find the way that
you can answer the question that you
have and you have a really great start
with the stuff that we've taught you but
there's a lot of stuff that we haven't
taught you machine learning is a
gigantic topic and a great machine
learning researcher is somebody who goes
out after this and try stuff on their
own that's how you learn so my last
question I have a hunch is this what the
next students is all about your hunches
are usually correct Sebastian and in
this case it is again in the next unit
we're going to be talking about datasets
we're going to be talking about
questions we've talked a lot about
algorithms they're very important but at
the heart of it machine learning is
about the data that you have and the
questions that you're trying to answer
with it we're going to really dig into
this topic and I'm very excited we have
a new data set we're going to be looking
at it's the Enron data set
a really interesting case of emails and
fraud and we're going to be taking a
really deep look at this data set trying
to figure out what we can get out of it
it's totally amazing I guess we would
see you in class
I hope so we'll see you in class</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
