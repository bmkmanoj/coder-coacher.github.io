part of our JavaScript parser that
handles JavaScript expressions this is
pretty straightforward just like the
last problem where we're essentially
enumerated that we've predefined for our
JavaScript language so let's go right to
the I d e so here we have the supply
code for the problem and if we look
closely we see that almost all the
parcels are enumerated to exactly what
they should be we have identifier
numbers strings to and false how to
handle a naught Q word do the opposite
and then in parenthesis for expressions
we're also given an enumeration of the
precedence and the associativity for
each of these operations so really we
have everything we need in the problem
description to do this problem and as
you can see here I've already filled in
the precedence ordering for the
operations and this is simply taken
almost exactly right from the comment
given in the problem where or is listed
at the lowest precedence and we go all
the way up to division right here I've
also added not just to make it work so
let's start filling in the rules my
first role is going to handle
parenthesis if we have a matching left
and right parenthesis the expression
that is equal to is simply the contents
of the parenthesis pretty
straightforward and now I have four
rules for some of our literal values we
have a number we're going to say number
and then the contents of that string
just simply say the word string if we've
matched true or false we're going to
return the specified tuples if we see a
nut then we simply have in our parse
tree there were not and then the
contents that are being negated now
afterwards we have about a dozen or so
binary rules addition subtraction times
modulus division etc etc and to save
some time I could enumerate each
function but I want to take a shortcut
so here I've said if we match any of
these things I'm calling in a binary
operation where the first element is the
left upper end of the binary operation
the next entry nor tuple is going to be
the operation being used and the last
one is going to be the right operand of
the binary operation and now i have the
expressions for function calls not just
decorations which we had in the last
problem a function call is going to be
an identifier with optional arguments in
between parentheses and the code for
handling optional arguments is almost
exactly the same as the code we use to
handle optional arguments in the
function decoration in fact i think it
is exactly the same and with all that
we've done it it's about 50 lines of
code and we're happy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
