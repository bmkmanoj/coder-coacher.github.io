wrote the tokens come not just with the
type of token in their value but also
their line number and column number that
sort of information is very handy to
keep track of for users at some point
you may have written an incorrect python
program now I've only written about a
million of them and it's really nice
when the interpreter tells you which
line the mistake is on unfortunately the
lexer won't do this for us entirely
automatically it will keep track of
columns but it won't keep track of lines
unless we do some work here's an example
of a rule that matches new lines you may
not have seen this before but we've
already seen how the backslash can be
used to escape special characters like
the quote this basically just means
quote however when paired with something
else the backslash often has a special
meaning backslash n is the string
equivalent of pressing the return or
Enter key on your keyboard we call this
the new line key that advances your
editor by one line so this rule token
new line matches a new line that appears
and when we see it we take the token and
increment its line number by one and
then we pass over the new line as if it
were white space here you can see that
I've added the new line rule just as I
described on the previous slide to our
old lexer from before let's go all the
way to the bottom and now I'm going to
make my web page much more complicated
and here I'm using triple quoted strings
showing the line one on the first line
and line two on the second unfortunately
the output shows line one followed by
the new line and have to go up here and
remove new line from the list of things
that it's possible to have in a word
just like we had to remove space and now
we see that line one starts on line one
and the line two starts on line two and
it's the seventh character from the
beginning of the file 0 1 2 3 4 5 is the
new line 6 is the space
seven is the capital l</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
