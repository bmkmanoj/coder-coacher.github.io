you have n copies of this structure here
in a row like this then there are 2 to
the power of n different shortest path
from A to B that visit all vertices and
the reason why that is is that each time
you encounter this structure here
there's the two possibilities that we
talked about so you can either go this
way up here or you can either go this
way down here and then you have to
continue this way until you get to one
of these edges here and then you can
read aside if you want to go up or you
want to go down so there's two
possibilities for the first one two
possibilities for the second one and so
on and so on and so on two possibilities
for the last one so 2 multiplied by
itself n times is 2 to the power of n
and this action doesn't look too bad
does it because each of these gadgets if
you will that I've drawn here could now
represent a variable in a boolean
formula and each shortest path between a
and B is kind of a true/false assignment
to those variables so we could say for
example that whenever we choose our path
from A to B to go up here and then like
this this structure here or this way to
do the path that that represents setting
the variable to true so this year would
represent X 1 for examples and then
going this way would mean x 1 is true
and going the other way so down with
represent false so this would be a way
to represent assignments of true and
false to the variables X 1 X 2 and so on
through xn now of course choosing the
path between NB is still totally
arbitrary what we are missing is the
clauses of the boolean formula and again
it takes a bit of playing around to find
out how we can represent clauses here in
