pretty important in practice and that's
creating software that can be tested
effectively and we're going to start off
with things that are kind of maybe a
little bit fuzzy and unquantifiable and
we'll get towards more very specific
recommendations a little bit later and
so I'm going to start off with some sort
of generic recommendations and first is
just a write clean code and of course we
all know that's pretty much impossible
so when it's not possible to write clean
code in the first place we need to
refactor code whenever necessary
so third for any software module that
we're writing we should always be able
to clearly describe what it is that this
module does and exactly how it interacts
with other code if we find ourselves in
a situation where we can't clearly
describe all of the dependencies that
our module has with other modules in the
system then we're probably in a
situation where we've created software
that can't be tested effectively code
should never have any more threads than
an absolutely needs to get its work done
the software should not be a swamp of
global variables global variables make
software really hard to test because
global variables are implicitly inputs
to any software to read the global
variables and so in addition to testing
software on its explicit inputs if we
have a lot of global variables we're
going to be forced to test a lot of
values of those and this can really make
testing difficult our code and this
applies probably more to C and C++ and
Java than to Python shouldn't be a soup
of references and pointers because these
are another way to create unintentional
connections between different parts of
the code breaking modularity and again
making it really hard to decrypt to test
our code most of the time the modules
that will create should have unit tests
and when applicable that is to say when
our modules are interfacing with other
modules that might fail we should add
support for fault injection finally
testable software often contains a large
number of assertions and so now we're
going to expand on that topic</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
