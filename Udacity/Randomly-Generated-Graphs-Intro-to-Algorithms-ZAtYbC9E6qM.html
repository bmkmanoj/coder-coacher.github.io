talking about very very structured
graphs very clean and organized graphs
things like chains or rings or grids
hypercubes that have a great deal
structure and they look very different
from the kinds of actual social network
graphs that you see in the wild regular
graph tend to have little bits of
clustering in them and some people are
more sparsely connected to some other
cluster and they start to look a little
bit more randomly generated or at least
not generated according to a very simple
straightforward rule so it's worthwhile
to think about some different ways of
randomly generating graphs the classic
kind of randomly generated graph that's
been studied in the mathematics
literature is generated according to
what's called the air dish reni model so
let me say a little bit about that now
we start off we imagine we have some
graph with n nodes we have some set of n
nodes and we have some probability P
which we'll call the connectivity
probability and the generation process
works like this we start off by
generating a set of n nodes with no
edges at all then we loop through all
possible pairs of nodes IJ and we
connect IJ but we only connect them
after we flip a coin that comes up heads
with probability P and if it does come
up heads we connect the pair otherwise
we don't we can do this for four nodes
so we have to decide whether to connect
the first two nodes so we flip a coin
comes up heads so we connect them now we
look at the second pair this one in this
one that also came up heads third pair
this one in this one also came up heads
next pair is this one in this one tails
no edge this one in this one heads and
finally this one in this one kids I
think I have a broken coin but anyway
you get the idea that you end up with a
graph with some of the edges included
and some of the edges not included now
there's lots of interesting mathematical
properties that you can derive given the
simplicity of this generation process
you can say well what should the
probability P be so that the graph is
very likely to be connected
there's no disconnected nodes floating
off into space or that there's
relatively short paths from one node to
the next and so this has been fairly
well studied researchers have found
however that these kinds of randomly
generated graphs don't seem to match
very well the kinds of social network
graphs that you see in practice in the
real world</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
