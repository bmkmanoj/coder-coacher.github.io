we have a recursive base case that says
if there's no numbers that we're looking
for we can't generate anything of those
lengths and so return the empty set then
we say the X matches we get by applying
X to any number up to the maximum of NS
including the maximum of n ask but then
we got to do some computation to figure
out what can be the allowable sizes for
y and we do that by saying let's take
all the possible values that came back
from the X matches and then for each of
those values and for each of the
original values for the links that we're
looking for subtract those off and
saying total is going to be one of the
things we got from X and one of the
things we got from why that better add
up to one of the things in NS and then
we call y with that set of possible ends
for Y and then we do the same thing that
we were going to do before we go through
those matches but this is going to be in
with a reduced set of possibilities and
count those up and now the thing that
makes it all work is this optional
argument here saying the number that
we're going to start at for the possible
sizes for X in the default case that's
zero and so we start the range at zero
but in the case where we're calling from
plus we're going to set that to one
let's see what that looks like here's
the Constructors the compilers for
sequencing plus for a regular sequence
there's no constraint on the start for X
X can be any size up to the maximum of
the ends but four plus we're going to
always ask that the ex parte have a
length of at least one and then the my
part will be whatever is left over and
that's how we break the recursion and we
make sure that jen seek will always
terminate now this language generation
program is little bit complex so I
wanted to make sure that i wrote a test
suite for it to chest the generation and
so here I've just defined some helper
functions and then wrote a whole bunch
of statements here if we check one of a
B and limit that to size two that should
be equal to this set it's going off the
page let's put it back where it belongs
one element of size zero two elements of
one and four elements of size two just
what you would expect here's sequences
of a star B star C star of zai is
exactly four here they are and so on and
so on we've made all these tests I
should probably make more than these but
does he give you some confidence that
the program is doing the right thing if
it passes at least this minimal test
suite</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
