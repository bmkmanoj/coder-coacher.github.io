features that uh let's come up with
three or four or three or four more
features and then move on sure so come
up with all right so I could sometimes
I'll look at the menu that's posted
outside and I'll see if the you know how
pricey it is okay so cost right so cost
can be represented as a discrete input
by the way it could also be represented
as an actual number right we could say
look it's cheap it's moderately
expensive it's really expensive or you
could have a number which is the average
cost of an entree and it doesn't really
matter for what we're talking about now
but just some way of representing cost
okay it's give me one or two more
features but I want you to give me some
features that don't have anything to do
with the restaurant itself that might
still be important hmm
because by the way hot date probably
doesn't have anything to do with the
restaurant itself so even though we've
been talking about features of the
restaurant we've actually been picking
up at least one feature that doesn't
have anything to do directly with the
restaurant itself not so whether I'm
hungry oh I like that here's another one
what's the weather like the raining
outside which is a different sense of
atmosphere right because if it's raining
outside maybe it's not your favorite
choice but you don't want to walk
anymore okay so we have a ton of
features here we've gone through a few
of them notice that some of them
specifically have to do with the
restaurant and some of them have to do
with things that are external to the
restaurant itself but you can imagine
that they're all important or possibly
important to whether you should enter
into the restaurant or not agree eat
alright and there's a bunch of features
you could imagine coming up with that
probably have nothing to do with whether
you should enter into the restaurant or
not like how many cars are currently
parked across the country probably
doesn't have an impact on whether you're
going to enter into a specific
restaurant or not okay so we have a
whole bunch of features and right now
we're sticking with features we think
might be relevant and we're going to use
those to make some kind of decision so
that gets us to decision trees so the
first thing that we want to do is we
want to separate out what a decision
tree is from the algorithm that you
might use to build a decision tree so
the first thing we want to think about
is
the fact that a decision tree is a
specific representation and then only
after we understand that representation
and go through an example well we start
thinking about an algorithm for finding
or building a decision tree okay are you
with me yeah excellent
okay so a decision tree is a very simple
thing well you might be might be
surprised to know it's a tree the first
part of it and it looks kind of like
this so what I've drawn for you is an
example sample generic decision tree and
what you'll see are three parts to it
the first thing you'll see is a circle
these are called nodes and these are in
fact decision nodes so what you do here
is you pick a particular attribute and
you ask a question about it the answer
to that question which is its value or
what the edges represent in your tree
okay so we have these nodes which
represent attributes and we have edges
which represent values so let's be
specific about what that means so here's
a particular attribute we might pick for
this top node here let's call it a
Hungary that was one of the features
that Michael came up with am i hungry or
not and there's only two possible
answers for that yes I'm hungry true or
false I am not hungry and each of these
nodes represent some attribute and the
edges represent the answers for specific
values so it's as if I'm making a bunch
of decisions by asking a series of
questions am i hungry and if the answer
is yes I am hungry then I go and I ask a
different question like is it raining
outside and maybe it is raining and
maybe it's not raining and let's say if
it isn't rainy that I want to make a
decision and so these square boxes here
are the actual output okay so it's
hungry so you're hungry yes and it's not
raining so what do you do so let's just
say you go in true I go in so when it's
I'm hungry but it's not raining I go in
and that
true is answering a different question
it's not in the nodes I guess so in the
leaves the TNF means something different
that's right it's the app it's exactly
right the the leaves the little boxes
the leaves of your decision tree is your
answer what's on the on the edges are
the possible values that your attribute
can take on so in fact let's try to
let's make that clear by picking a
different by picking another possible
attribute you can imagine that if I'm
not hungry what's going to matter a lot
now is say the type of restaurant right
which we said there were many many types
of restaurants so you know ty I forget
was now you came up with Italian and you
know some french fries and french fries
so if I'm not hungry then what matters a
lot more is the type of restaurant and
so I'll move down this path instead and
start asking other questions but
ultimately no matter how I what this
decision tree allows me to do is to ask
a series of questions and depending upon
those answers move down the tree until
eventually I have some particular output
answer yes I go in the restaurant or no
idea okay this is still seeming a little
bit abstract to me can we can we maybe
work through a very concrete example
yeah I think that makes a lot of sense
to go is okay let's do a quiz</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
