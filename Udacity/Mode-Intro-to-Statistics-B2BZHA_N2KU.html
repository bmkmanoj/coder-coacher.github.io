asked you to program the mode over data
set of course the lessons can have
multiple modes I just extended mine to
have three times the element five so
let's assume for now if you have
multiple modes you can return either one
I don't care but if it's unique
I want the correct mode so this is
entirely non-trivial perform and it's a
real challenge this is what makes this
class fun when you hit print mode of
this data set then I wanted to return
five now some hints there's many
different ways to implement it using
complex data structures such as sets but
at the minimum for a simple solution you
should know what a for loop is what an
if statement is and then there's a
beautiful function called data count and
you give it an argument like this case
the number five and that returns to you
how often this specific number of occurs
in the data over here three times for
number five if you were to give it six
as an argument that it doesn't occur at
all the result would now be zero so my
solution has a funny for notation for
variable I in the range of the length of
data Len data we know is number of
elements there are seven over here so
that will give me seven range turns us
into a list from zero to six of indices
into the data and then the for loop goes
to these indices that's one way to
access each element in the data
sequentially now the count thing allows
me to count how often each element
occurs so if you took my data took the
eigth data item then what this thing
gives me this funny thing he gives me
how often inside this function do I see
that specific number that is the ice
number in the original list I leave it
at this this is not a trivial question
if you get stuck you might go to the web
and read up on four on count on if
statements so here's the code and good
luck programming it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
