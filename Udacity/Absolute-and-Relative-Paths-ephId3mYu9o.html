system is the root directory and we
denote the root directory with a slash
you can describe the location of any
file or directory in the file system
with a full path beginning with a slash
the full path is called the absolute
path and that means that it tells every
step that has to be taken from the root
or the absolute beginning of the file
system absolute paths are unambiguous
and easy to understand but they can also
be inconvenient to work with especially
if you're working with deeply nested
directories to make things simpler we
can use relative paths instead a files
relative path is its location relative
to the current working directory if
you're working with files in or near the
current working directory this can save
you a lot of typing every time you
prefer to a file by just its name you've
actually been using a relative path this
is the simplest sort of relative path
the shell looks for the specified file
name within the current directory for
example if the current working directory
is ocean and the relative path of the
clam directory is just clam rather than
having the full path from the root we
can just have the path from the working
directory oh and CWD here is just an
abbreviation for current working
directory you can also write relative
paths or files and other directories for
example the relative path of the giant
file and the clam directory is just clam
/ giant notice that unlike a full path
the relative path does not start with a
slash that's how you can tell a relative
path from an absolute one you can also
write relative paths for items that are
closer to the root the special directory
entry dot dot points from a directory to
its parent so if you're in slash home
slash Philip slash ocean and you refer
to dot dot you're talking about the
directory slash home slash Philip and if
you refer to dot dot slash mountain
you're referring to slash home slash
Philip slash mountain there's also a
special entry which is just dot dot
points of each directory to itself for
example because our current working
directory is ocean if we use dot that
refers to slash home slash Philip slash
ocean another handy shortcut is tilde
tilde is an abbreviation for your own
home directory by starting a relative
path with a tilde you can easily specify
path
relative to your own home directory</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
