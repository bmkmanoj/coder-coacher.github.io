details of how a AES works but I want to
talk a little bit about the main
components of it so there are two main
things that go into AES and go into
almost all modern block ciphers they all
involve X ORS so we saw that in the
one-time pad and their X oaring some
round key which is generated by a key
schedule some process of generating new
keys for each round and then what's
going into that there are two main
operations one is shifts so permuting
bits and there would be a map that would
move bits around this is better than
just doing only X ORS because we're
moving data around instead of just X
luring and changing it the other thing
that's really important for a cipher to
be hard to curb analyze is to have some
non-linearity something that is very
difficult to analyze and mixes up data
in a way that is nonlinear this is done
basically by having look-up tables so
what's called the nest box is something
that takes in eight bits in this case it
could have different numbers going in
and basically has a lookup table so
that's going to have 256 entries mapping
each set of eight bits to some other set
of eight bits and designing that lookup
table is a challenge we want the lookups
to be as nonlinear as possible and make
sure there are no patterns in the data
in this table and so the way a s works
is combining shifts and S boxes with XOR
to scramble up the data and it's going
through multiple rounds so we'll take
the outputs of this put them back
through a series of shifts and S boxes
again and keep doing that and the number
of rounds depends on the key size so for
the smallest key for the 128-bit key
which is the smallest key size for AES
we would do 10 rounds going through this
cycle getting the output ciphertext for
that block so the details are definitely
more complicated in this and getting
them right is very hard
there's lots of great resources that
explain a s and detail though for our
purposes we're going to think of it as a
black box that we can use encryption in
our protocols we're going to assume it
has the properties that we want it to
have and not need to look in more detail
at how to actually implement that in a
modern cipher</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
