is given in an old paper by popeck and
Goldberg from 1974 there is a link to
that paper in the instructors notes
we'll go through the ideas that are
presented in that paper and we will
explain how to define virtualization the
definition states that a virtual machine
is taken to be an efficient isolated
duplicate of the real machine
virtualization is enabled through a
virtual machine monitor or vmm this is
the layer that enables virtual machines
to exist as a piece of software the
virtual machine monitor has three
essential characteristics the virtual
machine monitor provides an environment
for programs that essentially identical
with the original machine as I said the
capacity may defer however it would be
the same kind of CPU that the virtual
machine thinks it has the same types of
devices etc with this means is that as
the one of the goals of the virtual
machine monitor is that it must provide
some fidelity that the representation of
the hardware that's visible to the in
the virtual machine matches the hardware
that's available on the physical
platform second programs that run in
this environment show at worst
only minor decrease in speed now clearly
we have a situation where the operating
system and its processes in the virtual
machine are given only two CPUs as
opposed to the four that are available
on the physical machine this one
executed exactly at the same level it
won't be able to complete the programs
as fast as if they were immediately
however the goal of the virtual machine
monitor is that if the virtual machine
were given the exact amount of resources
as the physical machine then the
operating system and the processes would
be able to perform at the same speeds so
another goal of the virtual machine
monitor is to deliver performance to the
VMS that's as close to the native
performance as possible and once the VM
is in complete control of the system
resources this means that the virtual
machine monitor has full control to
make decisions who accesses which
resources and when and it can be relied
upon to ensure safety and isolation
among the VMS this doesn't mean that
every single hardware access has to be
inspected by the vmm layer instead what
this means is that the virtual machine
monitor determines if a particular VM is
to be given direct Hardware access and
also that once those decisions are put
in place a virtual machine cannot just
change those policies and potentially
hurt other co-locate at the ends so one
of the goals for the virtual machine
monitor is that it has to provide for
safety and isolation guarantees</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
