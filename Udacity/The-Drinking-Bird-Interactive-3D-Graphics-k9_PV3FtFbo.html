manipulate in future units you'll create
a basic drinking bird model very basic
at this point you won't even have a beak
we'll get to that in a later unit the
drinking bird is a little toy that
drinks from a cup google it the objects
you'll make are the legs body head and
jaunty hat here's a blueprint showing
front and side views well it's more of a
back of the napkin drawing but sometimes
that's all you get from a client me my
favorite client comment I heard that one
designer received was could you make
that sphere rounder the three objects
you'll use are the cube well box sphere
and cylinder here are the typical calls
for creating these three objects for the
cube the numbers passed in are the width
height and depth of the box the sphere
needs just a radius to describe its
geometry the additional two numbers
specify how much tessellation happens
along the equator and from pole to pole
respectively
you might try changing these
tessellation numbers to see the effect
on the body but please use these numbers
32 and 16 when you submit your answer
the cylinder gives an upper and lower
radius followed by a height and by the
amount of tessellation along its equator
again please use the number 30 to see
the additional course materials for
documentation for these various methods
there are three functions you'll be
working on the function create support
will make the drinking bird support
frame base legs and feet to get you
started
I've laid down a base that the legs
connect to along with the left leg
you'll have to add the right leg and
feet the function create body will
create the bird's body and spine the
function create head will make the head
and hat you have to create the objects
in the correct location and add them to
the scene when you've done that you'll
see the model of the drinking bird just
like it's shown here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
