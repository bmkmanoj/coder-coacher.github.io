just one left well okay I lied it's not
quite one left because there's also
scoring we'll have to do next but one
left for this part so all plays like
horizontal plays takes a hand and a
board and what should it return well
it's going to be a set the position in
which we start the word well that can be
the same as before an IJ position is
perfectly good but now we also we're
going to have some words going across in
some words going down so now we want our
results to be three tuple so it's a set
of an IJ position followed by a
direction across or down followed by a
word a set of those so now onto the all
plays function takes a hand in the board
it's going to return all plays in both
directions on any square so the play is
a position direction and a word where
the position is an IJ p ur gay picks out
the row number I the column number and
Direction is either across or down and
those are just be global variables we
don't have to decide for now how they're
represented and I use the trick here I
said all the horizontal plays the cross
plays we get from calling horizontal
plays directly on the hand and the board
the vertical plays I didn't have to
write a separate function all I have to
do is transpose the board so flop the
eye on that Jay Paul horizontal plays on
that that gives me a set of results but
they're the results in the wrong
direction there are ji pairs rather than
I J Pierce and so now your task is write
the code to put that all together to
take these two sets one of them is in
the reverse order so they have to be
swapped around neither set has the
direction associated with it and
assemble them all into the resulting set
that should be returned by all plays</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
