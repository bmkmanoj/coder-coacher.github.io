description of an algorithm into actual
Python code ended up using a couple
structures maybe a little bit
differently than before so I've got
Dijkstra algorithm Dijkstra is the name
of the individual who first described
and analyze this algorithm for a single
source shortest path right so we give it
a single source we give it a single node
in the network then we ask for the
distance to all the other nodes in the
network in graph G so the distance so
far is a structure that's going to
represent a mapping from nodes to what
we think the distance might be to from
v2 that node and in our hand simulated
algorithm these are the numbers in the
non locked circles some nodes might not
have any numbers yet and the ones that
have numbers are represented in that
mapping so then we start that structure
off by saying well the distance that we
know of so far from v2 the V the node
that we started at is 0 and we did that
in a hand simulation as well all right
now there's an additional data structure
which I call final dist which is once we
actually figure out what the real
distance is we stick it in this
structure and so that's basically the
numbers that are in the heavy circles
here once they when a circle becomes
heavy because I'm locking it down I move
that number into the final dist mapping
and I delete it from the dist so far so
that number doesn't exist anymore in the
in the disk so for mapping now we're
going to iterate as long as the set of
nodes for which we've computed a
distance is less than the total number
of nodes now this is a little risky I
probably should have done this because
if the graph is disconnected what this
is going to do is we're going to die
well we'll see where it's going to die
but it will it will keep trying to add
node nodes their final distances even
though there aren't final distances to
add so there's a there's probably other
tests that might be better to determine
when everything that's reachable has
actually been assigned a value so in
general this test isn't quite the right
test but it will suffice for a connected
graph and that's what we're going to try
it on what do we do as long as there's
more nodes that we need to analyze take
the node that has the shortest distance
of all the ones so far call that W and
lock it down so locking it down in this
case involves me printing a debugging
message saying that the the final
distance for W is whatever we computed
the distance so far as so we've gotten
the we now know that this is the final
distance and then we delete that from
the dist so far structure
then we go through its neighbors so all
of the neighbors of X sorry neighbors of
W in the graph call them X and for each
one we'll say well if we haven't already
completely solved that node if we've
completely solved that neighbor then we
don't have to do anything but if we if
we haven't then see if it has a distance
so far and if it doesn't then give it
one by saying well our best guess is two
the distance is going to be the distance
that it took to get to W plus the
distance from W to X on the other hand
if it already has a distance check if
the new distance the distance to W plus
the distance from W to X is better than
the distance that we had so far and if
it is replace it this is sometimes
called relaxation it doesn't seem very
relaxing but that's what it is and so
now we've handled that node we handle
all the nodes for the neighbors of W and
that means we've handled W we've locked
it down and we can move on so we go back
up and handle the next node closest to
the start state and once we've gone
through all of the nodes and assign them
all their final distances then we return
that structure and we're done so this is
the Dijkstra algorithm in in a nutshell
let's analyze this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
