is pretty straightforward
the interesting part of GPU computing is
defining the computation that actually
happens on the GPU we structure that
computation as a series of one or more
kernels now as we said earlier the GPU
has lots of parallel computation units
so when you write kernels those kernels
need to take advantage of that Hardware
parallelism so how do they do that and
here is the big idea it is one of the
very core concepts of CUDA as a
programmer when you write a kernel you
write what looks like a serial program
you write this program as if it runs on
a single thread then when you call the
kernel from the CPU you tell it how many
threads to launch and each of those
threads will run this kernel it is
perfectly okay to write a kernel and
then tell the GPU ok when you start
running this kernel launch a
hundred-thousand launch a million launch
ten million threads each of which will
run this kernel code you can and will
kick off an enormous amount of
computation each time you launch a
kernel now we haven't covered this yet
but you might be able to make a good
guess given this programming model what
is the GPU good at check all that apply
launching a small number of threads
efficiently launching a large number of
threads efficiently running one thread
very quickly running one thread that
does lots of work in parallel or running
a large number of threads in parallel</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
