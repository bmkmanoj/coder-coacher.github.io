called an oil Arian path this is a path
that starts off at some node in the
graph let's say a in this case and it
moves along the edges from node to node
hitting every edge exactly once and then
ending its own node of the graph so in
this case we have a no Larian path that
started at a and ended with d euler by
the way was famous mathematician
Leonhard Euler the made a number of
contributions to discrete math in
ultimately computer science here's
something that we can notice about a
graph if it has an oil arian path notice
what has to happen to all the nodes
along the path so here's what we did in
this example we went from A to B to D -
a - C to D so now let's consider the
degree of all the nodes in the graph so
a has a degree of 3 B has a degree of 2
D has a degree of 3 and C has a degree
of 2 so notice that these nodes B and C
which were not either the beginning of
the ending of the path the Euler n path
have an even degree and that has to be
what happens at all the nodes that are
not the beginning and ending nodes have
to have even degree because the path has
to go in one edge and out another edge
so every time that node gets passed
through to the edges are visited and
none of them are visited twice and none
of them are skipped so it has to be that
all these nodes that are intermediate on
the path have even degree the beginning
and ending nodes are different though
the path starts off at a and it leaves a
along one of the edges and that consumes
one of those edges and so the beginning
and ending nodes a and D in this case
have to have odd degree because in
addition to any times that the path
moves through them and comes out the
other side either leaves in the
beginning or enters at the end without a
corresponding other side so those have
to be on all the other ones have to be
even and it turns out that this
relationship is an if and only if that
is to say if a graph is connected and
has exactly two odd degree nodes then it
has an oil arian path and if it not then
it doesn't now there's one exception to
this what if all of the nodes in the
graph are even degree let's take a quick
look at a special case here here's a
graph with five nodes and the degree of
all the nodes is even to four to four
and two can a graph like this with only
even degree nodes
have an oil Arian path so one possible
answer is no the start and the end edges
of the path have to have odd degree
which they wouldn't in this case so it
can't have an oil Arian path another
possible answer is yes but it depends on
the particulars of the graphing question
so some graphs with only even degree
nodes have oil Arian paths and some
don't another possibility is that the
answer is yes all such graphs do any
graph that's connected and has only even
degree nodes we'll have an oil Arian
path of a particular form and another
possible answer is yes because all
graphs do you can't really have a graph
that doesn't have an oil Arian path</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
