squared and to see that we just have to
look at how many times steps this
algorithm requires as a function of n so
as you remember this line up here takes
zero time steps because it's just a
memory access and we set those we're
free
this one here it depends again what you
do with with the end of the range here
but it's going to be executed about n
times so it's either n or n plus 1 that
doesn't really make much much difference
here because now we can use Big O
notation how often is this inner loop
here executed so the first time it's
actually executed n times then the next
time it's executed it's going to be
executed only n minus 1 times and so on
and so on because this I here this value
here increases and as this increases
this inner loop here is going to be
executed less and less times so here we
have the first time we're going to have
n time steps the next time we're going
to have n minus 1 time steps the next
time we're going to have n minus 2 time
steps and so on and the same basically
also holds true for this inner loop here
so if this is executed n times then the
inner loop here again depending on how
you count that is going to be executed n
times or n minus 1 times so these two
parts here that is exactly where you
need the hint so it's 2 times this part
here so it's 2 times N squared plus n
over 2 so the total here is N squared
plus n so the total number of time steps
is 0 plus n plus n squared plus n which
is N squared plus 2n which is over N
squared now as you get more familiar
with analyzing algorithms you will
actually see that having two inner loops
usually leads to a quadratic running
time and you wouldn't even have needed
this exact hint here so with more
practice the analysis of algorithms
becomes easier and easier and you will
have to do less and less of the tedious
single line counting one final thing of
course o of n to the power of 3 is
technically correct but as I already
mentioned when discussing Big O notation
you want your bound to be as tight as
possible so this is really the own
correct solution</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
