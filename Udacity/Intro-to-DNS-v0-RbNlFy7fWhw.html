they don't type in your IP address they
put in a name like WWF example net a web
address with a host name in it the way
that your host name gets translated into
an IP address is through the domain name
system or DNS DMS is a worldwide
distributed director of network
information it stores a wide variety of
records but the best-known kind of DNS
record is the a record a for address
which maps a name like WWE ample net to
an ipv4 address client programs such as
web browsers look up these records in
order to find the address of a website
or another service as the creator of a
website you need to set up dns records
for it so that users can access it by
name usually that will involve
registering the domain with a registrar
and pointing the dns records at the web
servers IP addresses so that users will
be able to reach them a little later in
this lesson you'll have a chance to do
exactly that a DNS turns out to be
really important for websites if your
DNS goes down your site can't be reached
by most users a number of big sites
including Google and Microsoft have had
embarrassing outages caused by their dns
records expiring dns domains are also
used as part of the security mechanisms
for HTTP including ssl encryption and
cookie privacy the DMS client code which
is called the resolver is built into
every operating system and programs such
as nce or ping or web browsers can just
use it to test out dns we'll use a
couple of Handy shell utility is called
host and dig</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
