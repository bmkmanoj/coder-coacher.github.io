a vector in we label the matrix which is
quadratic with all the poses in all the
landmarks and here we assume the
landmarks are distinguishable and every
time we make an observation say between
two poses they become little additions
locally in the four elements in the
matrix defined over those poses so for
example if the robot moves from x0 to x1
and we therefore believe x1 should be
the same as x0 say plus five the way we
enter this into the matrix is in two
ways first one x0 minus 1 X ones add it
together should be Y minus five so we
look in the equation here x0 minus x1
equals minus five these are added into
the matrix that starts with zero
everywhere and it's a constraint that
relates X 0 X 1 by minus 5 it's that
simple
secondly we do it the same with x1 as
positive so we add 1 over here and for
that x1 minus x0 equals plus 5 so you
put 5 over here and a minus 1 over 4
differently the motion constraint that
relates x0 to x1 by the motion of 5 has
modified incremental e by adding values
the matrix for L elements that fall
between x0 and x1 we basically wrote
that constraint twice in both cases we
made sure the diagonal element was
positive and then we were the
correspondents off diagonal element as a
negative value we added the
corresponding value on the right side so
let me ask you a question suppose we
know we go from x1 to x2 and where's the
motion over here was plus 5 sin now it's
minus 4 so you're moving back in the
opposite direction what would be the new
values for the matrix over here and I
give you a hint they only affect values
that occur in the region between x1 and
x2
and over here and remember these are
additive</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
