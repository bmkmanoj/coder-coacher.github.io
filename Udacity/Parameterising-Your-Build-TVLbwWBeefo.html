where there's part of your build script
that you'll want to change somewhat
regularly while you're well on your way
to becoming a Gradle build master the
other developers using your build may
not be so familiar with Gradle this
means they're relying on folks to modify
your build script in order just to
change its behavior is less than ideal
this is especially true if you expect an
automated system to be running your
build solve this problem Gradle allows
you to parameterize your build by adding
properties to the project object from
locations outside your build script
command-line arguments Gradle out
properties files and environment
variables let's check out the syntax to
explore Gradle properties let's create a
task that prints a simple greeting if we
just run this as is somewhat
unsurprisingly we get a crash Gradle
says that it could not find property
greeting on task print greeting yep
that's not defined anywhere we'll need
to pass in the value of the greeting we
want to use the first way to do this is
using a Gradle dot properties file in
the same directory as your build script
if we just add the line greeting equals
hello from properties file and rerun the
task now we get the behavior we expect
another way to pass in a property to a
Gradle build script is to use the
command line in this case the dash P
flag lets Gradle know that we're going
to be passing in a property then the
name of the property equals and then the
value we want
note that the greeting property is now
defined in two places in the properties
file and from the command line let's see
which one wins
looks like the command line wins I hope
this makes sense because the command
line is the last line of defense before
the project is actually run there's a
third way we can use Gradle properties
and that's from inside the build script
itself if we pass a closure to the ext
property of the project object and then
we define our property then the property
is defined when we run our task note
that defining a property inside the
build script shadows all other
definitions like from a properties file</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
