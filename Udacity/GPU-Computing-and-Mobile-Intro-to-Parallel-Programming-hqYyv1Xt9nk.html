more expensive processors like the
couplers and like the GPUs you might buy
for gaming but also really works very
hard in the mobile arena and so how is
GPU computing going to influence that
well well it's it's not in our current
shipping products but the strategy and
it'll be available in the relatively
near future is to have the same GPU from
from top to the bottom of the line and
so you know if eventually you will have
a Kepler GPU in the Titan supercomputer
and you'll have a cup or GPU in your
cell phone and you can apply the same
programming models across that that line
and do GP GPU computing in your cell
phone to the extent that it makes sense
to do so so where do you see the most
interesting applications going for
things that you carry in your pocket
yeah I think that the really compelling
applications for for mobile devices are
in computational photography and
computer vision I think that you know
photography is that this cusp of being
completely transformed from something
that you do primarily with lenses and
optics to something you do primarily
with computing and but GPU is just a
perfectly matched
you know tool to basically do the type
of image processing and signal
processing you need to you know
basically after you've collected a bunch
of photons to process them in a way to
produce really compelling images so that
sounds fairly abstract and I think this
is a fascinating field so can you give
an example of something that maybe a GPU
would help you do in this computational
photography realm you know a little
low-level things are like if you want to
do a high dynamic range images you'll
actually acquire a set of images then
there's a bunch of problems in composing
them together the camera may have moved
slightly between the images so they have
to be registered there may be objects
moving in the images so even after
you've registered the images you have to
pack that object motion out to get the
equivalent of a still photograph that
was taken at one point in time you may
have what's called a rolling shutter
where because of the way the c cds work
you expose one line of the image at a
time and so if there's any motion
that'll produce sort of a wavy action in
the photo you're gonna have to remove
that and then you want to do some
processing of those images to remove
noise and to enhance the image and then
finally to decide both when you acquired
what exposure times you wanted
get an optimal high dynamic range image
then how to combine those images into
one final image that that basically
you've given a limited gamut that you
can display and your display device
gives the human who's viewing it the
appearance of actually many orders of
magnitude dynamic range from the
original collected image so bright areas
of the image look bright but not that
bright you don't have you know that much
dynamic range structures you display
that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
