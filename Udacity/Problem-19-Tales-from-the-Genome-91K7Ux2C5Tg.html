we can figure out what the genotypes are
for all the indicated individuals we
know from the last problem this is a sex
linked recessive trait so that means if
it's sex-linked it's excellent because
only males are affected here which means
males only have one copy of the X so an
unaffected male must mean he has the
unaffected allele he just has a plus and
an affected male all the affected males
must have a minus right because they're
effective but they just have one allele
but if this male is affected and the
father wasn't affected who did he get
his ex from from the mom the mom is
unaffected though so she has to be
heterozygous plus minus she has one
affected minus and one unaffected plus
allele in this daughter over here is
unaffected so it could be heterozygous
or it could be homozygous unaffected but
because she passed down an allele that
had affected offspring we can assume
very safely that she was heterozygous
right that she had one of these affected
alleles that was passed down even though
she was unaffected over here on the left
the affected nail did not have an
affected son right because he can't pass
the affected exon to a son so the Sun is
unaffected so plus sign but his daughter
has to be heterozygous because he had to
have passed on the affected allele from
the axe down to his daughter but this
female here she could be either plus
plus or plus minus we don't know based
on the information given and the one
last offspring that I left out over here
and unaffected male right must be plus
so these are all the possibilities in
this pedigree there's only one that you
could have chosen either homozygous plus
plus or heterozygous plus minus 4</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
