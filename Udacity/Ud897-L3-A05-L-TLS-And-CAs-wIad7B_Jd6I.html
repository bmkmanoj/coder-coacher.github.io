talking about two different concepts
HTTP and TLS formerly known as SSL we
already know about HTTP and TLS stands
for transport layer security TLS is not
specific to http but any protocol can
use it for example there's ftps which is
ftp with TLS to transfer files securely
TLS encrypts communication in a way that
can be read by anyone else other than
the intended recipients in practice it
is impossible to break a TLS encryption
to ensure that you're talking to the
server you intend to talk to TLS
utilizes something called a chain of
trust the server identifies itself with
a certificate that contains both little
metadata about itself and the
fingerprint of a the encryption key
these certificates are issued by one of
a handful certificate authorities if
that certificate is signed by such an
authority you know that if the key you
are using matches that fingerprint then
you're talking to the correct server the
list of certificate authorities can
actually be found in the browser you
could even add your very own authority
if you wanted to what you see here are
mostly companies that you can buy
certificates from they cost money as
they not only validate your server but
also validate your identity as the owner
of its server since not every developer
can or wants to pay money for a
certificate to offer basic security to
the users let's encrypt has come into
the market and offer certificates for
free let's take a closer look at how
certificates work and the security they
provide</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
