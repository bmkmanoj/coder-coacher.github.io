of a dollar delivered in the future even
if it comes from the US government is
worth less than a real dollar right now
a real dollar right now is worth one
dollar if I promise to give you a dollar
in the future it's not worth as much so
how should we estimate or think about
the value of dollars delivered in the
future I think we've also agreed that
the United States government promising
to give you a dollar in the future is
worth a bit more than the promise of
Tucker Balch giving you a dollar in the
future but having a real dollar in your
hand right now this one is worth the
most why is that you know you know
intuitively why that is the deeper
reason is there's a chance that I won't
deliver on that guarantee whereas we can
be pretty sure the US government will
deliver on that guarantee so it amounts
to risk and it all boils down to
interest rate we're trying to figure out
the present value or pv of a dollar that
will be delivered in the future so it's
worth some fraction of this future value
present value is worth some fraction of
the future value so here's the formula
in its entirety present value is equal
to future value divided by one plus
interest rate raised to the eye so the
eye is how far into the future this
payment is going to be delivered so for
instance is if it's going to be
delivered right now I is equal to 0 this
whole component becomes 1 and present
value is equal simply to future value in
other words if we're going to pay a
dollar present value is worth $1 if in
the future that future is going to be
one year from now it's 1 plus the
interest rate raised to the 1 power and
that is what the future value of that
dollar is so let's work out an example
suppose with the United States
government because they're so
trustworthy you can negotiate a 1%
interest rate actually as of today which
is 2015 this one-year interest rate is
only one quarter of a percent in other
words interest rates are very very low
if you work it out the value of a one
dollar bill paid to you in the future
one year from now at a 1% interest rate
is 99 cents in other words today it's
worthwhile for you to pay 99 cents to
the US government for the promise that
they'll give you a dollar in a year
ok consider now the Balch bond so it's
hard for me to sell you this asset right
now for the same price as a US
government because if you had to choose
between me and the US government for a
1% return why wouldn't you choose the US
government you should go with the US
government because they're more
trustworthy than I am so how can I
attract you well I can offer you a
higher interest rate let's say 5 percent
and that works out to a value of about
95 cents in other words in order for me
to attract you to buy my promise for one
dollar in the future I could only charge
you 95 cents so let's consider this in a
chart form so how much is a dollar worth
if I promise to give it to you today
well in that case this AI is equal to
zero so the present value is equal to
the future value of all this divided by
one so in all cases if the number of
years we're going to wait for the
delivery of that dollar is zero the
value is one dollar but what if we talk
about promising you that dollar in the
future if we look at this for the US
bond in one year we see it's worth 99
cents if we carry that forward it's sort
of this exponentially decreasing value
like that if you look at the Balch bond
which is of
not as worthwhile has a US government
you see one that decreases at an even
faster rate so in other words at each
year in the future this $1 is worth less
in other words if I promise to give you
$1 in two years it's worth less than if
I promise to give you $1 in a year it's
worth even less than if I promise to
give you the dollar right now and these
charts are different depending on what
the interest rate is in other words for
the higher interest rate assets they
decrease further into the future in
other words a dollar delivered in the
future is worth less now than the lower
interest rate assets</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
