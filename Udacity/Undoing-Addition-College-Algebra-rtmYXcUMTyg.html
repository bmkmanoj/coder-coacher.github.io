from being by itself on this side is
this plus 3 right here if that weren't
part of the equation if we just had for
example x equals 12 then we would not
very much work to do we'd already have a
solution to our equation however it is
here so we need to figure out how to get
rid of it so how do we undo addition
subtraction to make it so that nothing
extra is added to the left side we need
to subtract 3 from the left side that
will make it so this entire side of our
equation says X plus 3 minus 3 now if we
sell this as just an expression we would
know how to simplify that the 3s would
just cancel one another out since 3
minus 3 is 0 and we would have x + 0 or
just X that's a super important step in
moving forward and solving our equation
but wait important whatever we do the
left-hand side of the equation we also
have to do to the right side so we make
sure that these two sides are still
equal to one another so I need to put a
minus 3 here underneath the 12 as well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
