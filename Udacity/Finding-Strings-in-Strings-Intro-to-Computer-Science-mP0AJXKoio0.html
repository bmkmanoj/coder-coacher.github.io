operation on strings which we'll find
very useful which is the find operation
it gives us the way in a big string to
find some substring that we're looking
for the way we use find is a little
different from the way we've used other
operators so far because fine is
actually a method and what that means is
a built-in procedure provided by Python
will be able to define our own
procedures soon we'll get to that in
unit 2 find as a procedure that operates
on strings so we use it by having a
string followed by dot find followed by
a parenthesis and then we pass in
another string which is the string that
we want to find in the first string and
the output a find is to position in the
string where that substring is found the
first occurrence of the string so if
that string happens to occur more places
than one in the input string the result
of find is always going to give us the
position that's the number where the
first occurrence of the substring occurs
so the output of using find will be the
first position in the search string
which is this blue string right here
where the target string which is the
purple string occurs so that will be a
number if the target string is not a
found anywhere in the search string then
the output will be negative one so let's
try a few examples to understand how
that works and we'll do this in the
Python interpreter here I've initialized
the variable Pythagoras to hold the
string here that's been attributed to
Pythagoras we don't know if he really
said it but it says there's a geometry
in the humming of strings there is music
in the spacing of spheres so now we have
that variable initialized so I'm going
to invoke find using Pythagoras as the
string that we're searching in and
that's the value that we initialized it
to with the string passing in as the
search string the string string when we
run this we see that we get 40 as the
result if we counted this is position
zero we would see string starting at
position 40 since I don't want to count
that far we can use our indexing to see
if that's right so let's print
Pythagoras starting from index 40 we
could print all the way to the end using
the colon
and when we run that we see that it
starts with string which is what we
found with the find we can search for
other positions if we search for
Pythagoras the single letter T well that
matches the beginning so we should find
the result at position zero which is
what we get and we can look for sphere
that will match sphere at the end we get
position 86 let's print the quote from
position 86 and we see the end of the
quote starting from sphere if we search
for a string that's not in the string
that we're using as the search string so
let's look for say algebra which was not
in the quote from Pythagoras we get to
output negative 1 that means the string
was not found</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
