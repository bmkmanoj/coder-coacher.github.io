is that I think that that training
animals in captivity is the absolutely
best thing you could do for any animal
because it teaches them to cooperate
with their own care it gives them
freedom from stress because they learn
to understand more about their
environment and it develops a very
positive feeling about their caregivers
and their entire experience so we can
train animals to do amazing things
including eyedrops stomach tubes
inoculations we have injected the
animals with anesthesia and remove teeth
voluntarily instead of having to do
something abusive like hold them down
and force them through a procedure we
can release our animals into the open
ocean and train them to perform
behaviors working with us to work as
watchdogs which is what the military
does or as researchers which is what i
have done working with us in their
natural environment and they choose to
come back on the strength of the basis
of the relationship that we have with
them so we can take better care of them
as well as learn from them as well as
enrich them through this method so say I
or you know one of our students wants to
do what you do how can we do that so we
actually offer internships for people
people come all over the world and come
and work with our sea lions they can
learn how to train the sea lions up
close and personal and learn all of
these basic psychology techniques so
even if you're not a psychologist you
can learn how to apply psychology and
practice it right here in the facility
with really amazing animals</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
