changed some key words they had a
different spelling or it's almost as if
we had to translate them into a
different language the underlying
meaning was the same in both languages
we can translate programs functions
between Python and JavaScript provided
that we know both of them in linguistics
people will sometimes talk about a
universal grammar is there may be some
grammar that would sit behind and
describe Python JavaScript English and
French I don't want to get into that for
natural languages but we will see either
in this class or in subsequent ones that
for computer languages like Python or
Java Script C and C++ visual basic
c-sharp o camel free basic they're all
the same in a very strong sense they're
altering complete I'm not going to go
into that in much detail now but it
suffices to say that Python and
JavaScript are equally powerful any
thought that I could think in one I can
also think in the other so now I'm going
to bite the bullet and actually write
out a partial grammar for JavaScript
this is only a partial grammar because
it only handles expressions and it only
handles some of the expressions an
expression can either be an identifier
like a variable named X or a function
like sign or abs Val a number 13.5
negative to a string like Hello and
quotes literal constants like true or
even false these are the equivalent of
numbers but for the bullion's there are
only two numbers true and false and then
a large number of binary operators if
you have two expressions you can add
them together subtract them multiply
them divide them watch out for division
by zero you can compare them to see if
one is less than the other you can
compare them to see if they are exactly
equal and if they're bullion's you can
check to see if the first is true and
the second is true just a little note if
you haven't run into this before two
ampersands means and two vertical bars
means or so in Python where you might
write and or or in JavaScript you use
these binary operator symbols instead
and just as we have less than here that
also be greater than great
equal to less than or equal to many more
this JavaScript expression grammar
should be familiar to you because aside
from some minor details of spelling like
the equal signs here or the capital word
true to mean true it should be very
similar to Python</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
