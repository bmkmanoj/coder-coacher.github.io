the equation of the probability density
function we can use calculus to find the
area under the curve between any two
values or between negative infinity and
any value mathematicians have put these
values in a table here's the top of this
table it gives you a little diagram
saying that when we have the z-score the
values in this table tell us the
proportion less than that z-score in the
standard normal curve so this table is
for the standard normal distribution and
remember that's when the mean is 0 and
the standard deviation is 1 this way
after standardizing any normal
distribution in other words after
calculating the z-scores for the values
that were interested in we can use this
table to approximate the proportion less
than that particular z-score here the
tenths place runs vertically and the
hundredths place runs horizontally so if
we have of a z-score of say negative
2.75 remember that would then be less
than the mean negative 2.7 is here in
point zero 5 is here so if we follow
over these cells meet at point 0 0 3 so
the proportion less than negative two
point seven five is point zero zero
three or three percent so again that's
the probability that we get less than
negative two point seven five and that's
the proportion of objects in the sample
that have a score less than negative two
point seven five there's a link to the Z
table that we shared and so use that
link when you use the Z table which
you're going to use in the next quiz</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
