development I want to talk about another
process that is very popular these days
and it's used that in many companies
which is called scrum which similar to
XP is another agile development process
and I'm gonna start by discussing with
the scrum actors are there's three main
kinds of actors the first one is that
product owner which means the customer
the product owner is mainly responsible
for the product backlog where the
product backlog is basically the list of
things that have to be done the backlog
in fact for the project and that is
analogous to the user stories to be
realized in XP that we just saw so what
the product owner does is to clearly
express these backlog items and also to
order them by value so that they can be
prioritized the second actor is the team
the team is responsible for delivering
shippable increments to estimate the
backlog items
it's normally self-organized consists of
four to nine people and it's what you
can will consider normally as the main
development team in a project and
finally we have the scrum master the
scrum master is the person who's
responsible for the overall scrum
process so he or she has to remove
obstacles facilitate events health
communications and so on
so you can see the scrum master as sort
of the manager or the person who's get
oversee do the supervisor of the scrum
process</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
