throws away data that is least recently
used so as you insert more and more keys
in the memcached if there's not enough
room keys that you haven't accessed in
in the longest amount of time just get
purged from the cache automatically so
the cache automatically has the most
recently accessed things let's talk
about some of these other answers it
doesn't throw an error now if this was a
database it should throw an error
because you want your database you rely
on your database to store your data and
if it's not going to be the store it
should tell you it shouldn't just
silently you know it you know accept new
data and throw away old data or
something like that but memcached it's
not an error to store too much data it
can only store so much the next answer
throw away data that is least frequently
used this commonly referred to as an L F
you cash least frequently used this is a
common way of doing caches but memcache
doesn't do it that way they use what's
called an L are you cash which you know
is least recently used you know at least
frequently used implies some sort of
notion of keeping track of how many
times each key is access you know it's a
little bit harder to implement and least
recently used which is just a simple
sort you know just throw this throw the
key to the front add the key to the
front of the list and the final answer
right the extra data to disk as we said
memcached is entirely in memory there
are variations of memcached that right
extra data to disk but you know writing
to disk means you know it's a
performance straight off writing to disk
is slow reading from disk is slow if you
want to be writing data to disk memcache
probably isn't the right solution for
you you know you can use a database so
you can use some other piece of
technology that's you know kind of
splits the difference you know
sacrifices a little speed for a little
bit more durability or space or whatnot</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
