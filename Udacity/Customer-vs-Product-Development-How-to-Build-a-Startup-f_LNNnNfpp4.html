from a lack of customers than from a
failure product development and that's
really interesting even in Silicon
Valley where we probably take more
technical risk per square inch or square
foot than anywhere else in the world we
go out of business typically not because
we didn't deliver a product we go out of
business because we didn't find enough
customers to pay us enough money that's
a big idea because if you think about it
we have all these processes to manage
the engineering process why because that
is the biggest risk in a large company
but we had no processes to manage the
customer risk fact the best we could do
is in in the old days is hire a VP of
Sales who told you oh I have a great
rolodex or great set of contacts but we
really had no formal process for
searching for what customers needs are
and in fact we've just come up with one
and that's going to be a key part of
this course this search for the business
model this search for the truth is
called customer development and customer
development really has two pieces the
search and its execution and in this
class we're going to be talking about
the first two steps customer discovery
customer validation the pivots that
connect them and then a few years are so
lucky we actually get to execute your
business model in customer creation and
company building the other piece that
goes with the process in a start-up is
not only the customer development
process but an agile engineering process
one example is extreme programming or XP
which basically is built around this
idea of iteration and incremental
delivery of the product this is a big
idea
it says instead of building every
possible feature on day one we're
actually going to incrementally and
iteratively interact with customers test
each portion of the product and see if
what we're building actually has a home
outside the building so what this really
means is that for process instead of
just going to execution first hiring
product managers doing
waterfall development or maybe even
agile nowadays we're actually going to
start with a customer development
process coupled with some kind of agile
engineering process which one you pick I
use XP as an example but it could be
whatever your favorite process is and by
the way don't only think that agile
engineering agile development is about
software Toyota and the Toyota
Production system actually had it for
Hardware decades before anybody and
software ever thought about it so you
could be building products anything from
microprocessors to medical equipment to
hardware or software etc using an
iterative and incremental engineering
process and again once you're done with
that of course you want to manage this
in a formal process but not before you
do the planning</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
