about cameras I just wanted to showcase
to you the importance of different types
of sensors we discussed the photographic
process that was applied to both digital
and film capture also discussed how
sensors work in a camera we looked at
different types of color filters talked
about bear filtering discussing brief
CCD and CMOS sensors and also discuss a
little bit about the camera RAW format
the goal of course of all of this was
for us to now learn as much as we could
have about what a camera is and how rays
of light are converted into pixels we've
looked at how to do pixel based
processing before we know how light is
captured in this instance so now we will
take a little bit more deeper look at
doing computational photography so in
the next class we will actually get into
doing some computational photography
we'll start with learning a lot about
things like blending and fading
eventually we'll come to look at things
like oh how can we actually build
panoramas and high dynamic range imaging
some of the well-known examples of
computational photography of course I'll
be exploring and actually also
showcasing to you a wide variety of
other sets of examples and the same way
again just wanted to list a few examples
of books that you could look at that
give you more details about both cameras
the processing pipeline and also you
know how photography really works while
this class is not really about
photography these are foundational
things that we will actually be playing
around with a lot again look for
additional details on the website for
the class and remember always have fun
computing with photographs</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
