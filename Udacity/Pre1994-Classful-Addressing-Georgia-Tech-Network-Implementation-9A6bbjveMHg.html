a network ID portion and a host ID
portion so if we take our 32 bits
suppose the first bit is a zero note
that that's half of all ipv4 address
space anything that starts with a 0 is
going to be known as a Class A address
and the next seven bits will represent
the network ID or the network that owns
this portion of address space the
remaining portion of the address space
is dedicated for hosts on that network
in this case any class a network can
support up to 2 to the 24th hosts
addresses that started with 1 0 were
designated as Class B networks where the
first 16 bits signified the network ID
and then remaining 16 bits signified the
host ID for that network note here that
each Class B address range represents
about 165 thousandth of all Internet
address space so discounting the first
two bits which indicate that this is a
Class B Network we have about 2 to the
14th unique class B's each of which can
have 2 to the 16th or 65,000 hosts on
each network class C's use the first 24
bits for the net ID and the remaining 8
for a host ID so each Class C Network
essentially can only have 255 hosts on
it this plot shows the BGP routing table
size as a function of the year starting
in 1989 and going up to 1994 you can see
that at this time the internet routing
table is quite small it started at less
than 5,000 prefixes by comparison now we
have about 500,000 IP prefixes in the
internet routing table but we can see in
this period that internet routing table
growth began to accelerate in particular
the growth rates were exceeding the
advances in hardware and software
capabilities and in particular we began
to run out of the Class C address
allocation there were far more networks
that needed just a handful of IP
addresses such as a Class C address
space could provide and yet because
only a certain range of the IP address
space could be used for Class C
addresses we began to run out fairly
quickly so there began to be a need for
more flexible allocation the solution to
this problem was something called
classless inter-domain routing or cider
something that we'll cover in the next
lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
