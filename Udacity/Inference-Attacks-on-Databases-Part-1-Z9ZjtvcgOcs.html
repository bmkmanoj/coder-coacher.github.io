different kind of an attack this is
called inference attacks that can be
performed or mounted against databases
so the definition of an inference attack
is actually fairly straightforward
inference attacks occur when somebody is
able to use queries that they're
authorized for allowed to execute those
queries but by executing those queries
they're able to gain access to
information for which they're not
authorized they're not allowed to access
that information directly so the way
they gain access to that information is
by executing a set of queries that are
authorized and then making an inference
based on the results that are returned
by those queries so a concrete example
here since we're talking to students in
a course is let's say a database that
contains all your grades so schema maybe
you know we have an attribute that is
the students ID maybe the student
standing whether it's junior or senior
and then scores these might be numerical
values between 0 and 100 let's say on
exam 1 on exam 2 and in the final grade
couple if you look at it's going to have
a student ID no the junior or senior
they're standing the two exams course
and the final grade so if we consider
this database where we have a tuple for
each student in the class couple as we
just discussed what kind of query can
you allow on it which any user should be
allowed to submit and get the result
from it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
