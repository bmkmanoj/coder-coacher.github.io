comes to two founding co-founding
partner founding companies one obviously
is easy because all decisions rest with
one person two is good and powerful
because it's a conversation three is
probably the limit I I don't know that I
would ever get involved in a business
where there's more than three top
partners who are making decisions the
reason for that is three people form a
very strong axis you have lots of
strengths on the table and all the
weaknesses typically are covered and you
won't ever have one person dominating if
you do that it's actually a sole
proprietor with two lackeys so we'll get
into that but a three co-founder
business I found in my experience to be
very strong one of the businesses I was
part of I was one of three co-founders
and we were very powerful of what we
were doing because we each brought a
different skill set to the table and a
different temperament given changing
environments and scenarios that were
playing out so as those things played
out we each stepped up in the given
situation with our skills and overcame
them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
