kidding you're going to render your own
map in your site in just a moment google
maps are made up of lots of different
types of data imagery road networks
points of interests more things you'll
use pieces and combinations of that data
to build a user experience that has
value when you render a map you can
control what type of information you get
one of the most basic things you can
control when you render your map is the
map type we have four pre-configured map
types you're probably most familiar with
the road map map type which you've seen
as the default in Google Maps we also
have satellite if you want real images
of the world or hybrid in which we
overlay features such as roads on top of
satellite imagery and finally we have
terrain which emphasizes shaded relief
and other physical terrain information
now that you understand what you're
seeing let's load the map into your site
I'm starting off with just a basic HTML
site it's blank right now you can load a
Google map into your site simply by
adding three things into your code the
first is a script line into your HTML to
load the API this loads the JavaScript
definitions when the page starts loading
in the browser we're loading the
JavaScript here asynchronously which
means the rest of the page will render
while the JavaScript API loads and then
our callback function will execute when
the API is downloading if you're not
immediately using the api's
functionality you can put the same
instruction inside a function and call
it only when you plan to use it loading
the API asynchronously gives you more
speed as it lets your page load without
having to wait for the JavaScript Maps
Google API scom is the end point that
we're loading the JavaScript from the
parameter V equals 3 indicates that
we're calling version 3 of the API which
is the version that we want to use next
you must include the API he that you
just created use the key parameter and
simply paste in the browser key that you
generated in your project alternatively
you can use a client ID if you're a Maps
API premium plan customer will learn
more about
later in the course the next thing that
you need is a div element in your HTML
body with the idea of map easy I'm also
adding some CSS to specify that I want
our map to be one hundred percent of the
height of the page finally we'll need
some more JavaScript a map variable and
an initialized JavaScript function to
load the map something to note and
putting all of this in one file but you
can also separate out your JavaScript
into a separate file to keep it neat
this initialize function will contain
everything that will happen after the
page loads but before the user interacts
with the map for now it's only job is to
make a map appear we're creating a new
map instance here and we must specify
two things we're in the HTML to load the
map which is going to be that mapped if
that we created and what part of the
world to show we have to give it a
center and a zoom value so that it knows
what imagery to show and in how much
detail the center is a latitude and
longitude in the form of what's called a
lat long literal we'll use this all the
time throughout the course the zoom is
just a number the higher the number the
more detail you can go up to level 21
all right you've made a beautiful
dynamic map of your very own this map is
centered on the lovely Google office in
New York City notice that all classes
live within the Google Maps namespace we
just saw an example of this when we use
the google maps map class to create a
map object as you learn more about the
classes you'll see this naming
convention over and over now you try</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
