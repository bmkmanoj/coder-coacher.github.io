learning by correcting mistakes we
started off by revisiting explanation
based learning an incremental concept
learning in those lessons we were
dealing with a small number of examples
coming in one by one we get with the
same thing here but here we had the
additional feedback about whether or not
our initial conclusion was right or
wrong we didn't talked about isolating
mistakes this was similar to our problem
diagnosis give it a mistake how do we
narrow down our reasoning to find
exactly where that mistake occurred then
we talked about explaining mistake this
is key both to building human-like
agents and to enabling the agent to
correct its mistake only by explaining
the mistake can the agent corrected
efficiently and after those phases
correction becomes a much more
straightforward task next time we'll
talk about meta reasoning in more detail
for example here we've discussed
mistakes and knowledge but what about
mistakes in reasoning what about
mistakes in architecture what about gaps
instead of mistakes where we don't know
something instead of knowing something
incorrectly we'll talk about all that
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
