would choose and why since we have the
power of a web-based visualization
library disposal temple Jas you do not
have to take my word for it we can
experiment with each of the chart types
a common theme they will bring up over
and over again throughout the course is
the process of iterating on a
visualization this is often called
prototyping or sketching I wanted to
show you the process I went through to
come to my own conclusions about the
chart type and hopefully make designing
visualizations see much less mysterious
and since there is never truly a right
answer with visualizations just like
there is no right way to write a book or
a news article once in power with the
insights that will now go through you
can hopefully extend and adapt my
visualization to make it your own we
will see later in this lesson by some of
the design decisions that the creative
d3 made makes this process of iterating
experimenting with visual displays quite
seamless and sometimes even if there is
a right or best chart to visualize your
data you often don't know ahead of time
how the data will interact with the
aesthetic of your visualization
including things like layout color
scales and how will interact with the
web page itself we have already seen
which aspects of the grammar of graphics
the creator of d3 chose to implement in
his design decisions for the library and
how this makes the process of iterating
and experimenting with visual displays
quite seamless</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
