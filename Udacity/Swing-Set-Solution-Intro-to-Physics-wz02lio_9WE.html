actually remarkably similar to the skier
problem we did in the previous problem
set and we're gonna have to use a lot of
geometry to help us get through this so
we're first gonna try and solve for what
your speed is when you just jumped off
the swing and to know that we're gonna
have to know how much potential energy
you started with and to know how much
potential energy we had we're gonna have
to know what your height was above the
ground and doing a little trigonometry
here I find that the maximum height
achieved by the swinger is 5 minus 4
times the cosine of 45 degrees and this
turns out to be two point one seven
meters and using the equation for
gravitational potential energy
I find that my original potential energy
is 1302 joules so I know that the
original potential energy this value of
1302 joules is going to be exactly equal
to my final potential energy plus my
final kinetic energy so let's start by
solving for the final potential energy
so once again doing a little more
trigonometry
I find that my final height above the
ground is one point five four meters and
using this height I get a final
potential energy of 924 joules now from
this equation I know that the final
kinetic energy is just going to be equal
to the difference in the two potential
energies which is equal to 378 joules
and using the equation for kinetic
energy I get that the final speed is
equal to three point five five meters
per second all right now that I know my
speed when I'm jumping off the swing it
should be pretty easy to figure out how
far I go all right if I do a little
geometry here I see that the angle that
the velocity vector makes with the
horizontal is exactly 30 degrees the
angle of the pendulum and now that I
know that this angle is 30 degrees I can
solve for the x and y components of
velocity as shown here now I can use
this kinematics equation here to solve
for the time T when I finally reach the
ground and note that this value Delta Y
is not equal to one meter when I jump
off the swing it's actually equal to
this value H F and plugging in my
numbers here and then using the
quadratic equation to solve for T I find
that T equals negative point 4 0 5
seconds or T equals 0.761 seconds and
just like in the ski jumping problem we
know that it's actually this value for
time when we care about this one we
don't care about so now we know it takes
me 0.761 seconds after I jump off the
swing to hit the ground now let's figure
out how much I move along the ground in
this time so to calculate how far away
from the swing I land I'm gonna use this
kinematics
here and this time there is no
acceleration in the x-direction and
plugging in my numbers i find that i
landed two point three four meters away
from where i jumped off the swing great
