an element so how do you get from here
to here
the answer is content as it turns out
elements can go inside other elements
content isn't just text it is also other
elements so this is a new tag
it's a div which means division a
division element or we just call them
divs
are used to group chunks of content
together and you'll be learning a lot
more about divs later on but either way
inside this div comes an h1 element this
h1 is a child of the div here let me
reorganize to make it a little bit
clearer I move the h1 to its own row and
I've tabbed it in this makes it really
clear that the h1 belongs to its parent
div you can see that the h1 comes
between the opening and the closing div
tags you'll need to use this same format
when you're writing HTML let me go ahead
and add another element to the mix okay
pause for one second what do you think
the tree from this HTML looks like
what's the parent what are the children
what are the siblings
okay I'm gonna pause for a second and
let you think here it is you can see
that the div is the parent of the h1 and
the P and that h1 and P are both
siblings so just to be clear this is the
code that you write and this is a way of
thinking about it as I keep saying it's
going to be really handy later on
knowing that your code turns into this
of course as you're writing your code
the trees that you create with HTML can
grow as wide or as deep as you need them
to be it doesn't matter</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
