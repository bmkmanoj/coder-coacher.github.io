accurate are these forecasts can you act
on them
do they really predict the future well
at least a first step towards answering
that question can be found by back
testing so that means you roll back time
and you test your system so here's our
historical data as usual it's organized
with time coming down now in order to
test the capability of our approach we
have to limit the data it sees to a
certain amount of time and then make
predictions into the simulated future so
we allow our system to only look at data
up to a certain point you can use data
before that all it likes it builds a
model and then makes a forecast on the
basis of that forecast we can then now
place orders anticipating that that
forecast will be achieved so we might
long some stocks or short them as
appropriate we can take those orders now
put them into our trading simulator and
see how the portfolio works so this time
right here is the same as this time here
so we enter our positions on that date
which is the same as that date and then
we roll it forward and see what happens
with the portfolio using software that
we built in this class you can measure
things like Sharpe ratio return and so
on for that portfolio now we're training
over new data make a new forecast and
then make a new set of orders we enter
these orders in our trading simulator
and then go forward and see what happens
I'm optimistic that it's always going to
go up and to the right anyways this
process can be repeated over and over
and over again using historical data and
we can simulate our learning algorithm
and how it would trade in this way and
that's called back testing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
