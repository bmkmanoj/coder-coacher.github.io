pretty limited that we had to do the
same thing on all data we couldn't do
anything that really depended on what
the data was so what we're going to do
next is figure out the way to make code
behave differently based on decisions
the first thing we're going to do is
figure out some ways to make comparisons
so we have a way to test and decide what
we should do so Python provides lots of
different operators for doing
comparisons there are things similar to
what we've used in math we have a less
than sign that compares two numbers we
have a greater than we have a less than
or equal to things like this all of
these operate on numbers so we can have
a number followed by a comparison
operator followed by another number this
is very similar to the grammar we saw
earlier for arithmetic expressions but
now instead of having a plus or times
here we can have something that does a
comparison the output of a comparison
though is not a number it's a boolean
value and a boolean value is one of two
things
it's either the value true or the value
false so let's see some examples in the
Python interpreter so first we'll use
the less than to compare 2 and 3 so 2 is
less than 3 so we expect the result to
be true when we run this we see that the
result is true if we compare a number
greater than 3 let's say 21 less than 3
the result will be false we could have
any expression we want with a comparison
so we can do 7 times 3 is less than 21
when we run that we also get false
because 7 times 3 is equal to 21 which
is not less than 21 another comparison
operator we can use is not equal to so
exclamation point equal means not equal
to so 7 times 3 not equal to 21 is false
because 7 times 3 is equal to 21 if we
want to do a quality comparison we don't
use the equal sign we use two equal
signs we call that the double equal so
now we have 7 times 3 doubly quill 21
and the result there is true so now
we're going to have a quiz to see if you
can figure out why we need to use the
double equal here instead of just the
single equal
so the question is why is the quality of
comparison done using double equal sign
having two equals instead of just a
single equal sign so the possible
answers because the single equal sign
means approximately equal and we want to
do exact equality comparisons because we
needed to use two characters for the not
equal comparison and we wanted the equal
to be the same length because Guiteau
the designer of Python really likes
equal signs because the single equal
sign means assignment or it doesn't
really matter we could use either double
equal or single equal</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
