the journal processes of understanding
here are two stories that we have
encountered earlier the first story is
talking about our earthquake that hit
lower slovakia and caused some damage
the second story is talking about
prisoner Louis love AVR who kills with a
number of proposals both of them deal
with killing but the meaning of the two
stories are very very different humans
make use of stories to understand the
world around them the world offers a
very large amount of data at any given
time we use these stories to provide
structure to that data to make coherent
sense of it when we discuss these two
stories earlier using frame as the
knowledge representation language we
found that we could have a frame for
this notion of killing killing of 25
people and this notion of killing the
killing of 25 proposals and there was no
simple way in the frame knowledge
representation to disambiguate between
those two meanings of killing now we'll
examine how we can construct a different
interpretation as the first story from
the interpretation of the second story
based on different interpretations of
the word killing in the two stories in
order to make two stories simpler and to
illustrate our point we're going to
focus on one sentence from each story
sentences that contained the word kill
humans a little difficulty in
understanding the first sentence means
something completely different from the
second sentence because it killed in the
first interfering something completely
different fully killed in the second
sentence how can we build an AI program
that can do the same thing we will see
that the AI program we need to use a lot
of background knowledge in order to be
able to do that and that would generate
hypotheses about how humans might be
using that background knowledge to
similarly disambiguate between different
senses of the word kill</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
