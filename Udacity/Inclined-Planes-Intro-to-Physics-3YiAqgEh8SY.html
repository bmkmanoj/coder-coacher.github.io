quick lesson on inclined planes because
they're really a fascinating tool for
making nature work for us now we already
know that Galileo had a lot of fun
rolling balls down inclined planes and
if you remember the reason he did this
was because it slowed down motion
allowed him to make some measurements
and observations that he couldn't have
made with just objects in freefall
the question though is why did rolling
balls down an inclined plane slow down
their motion sure it seems sort of
obvious but let's analyze it instead of
rolling balls let's imagine sliding
blocks because the physics of rolling is
slightly more complicated than I want to
get into right now
so we're zoomed in now and here's our
block and it has mass m and we're going
to let it slide down this inclined plane
for now we're pretending this plane has
no friction remember friction is the
force associated with things rubbing
well let's do what we always do and draw
a force diagram as always weight points
straight downwards and the normal force
and remember normal means perpendicular
actually points in this direction and
that's because it has to be
perpendicular we're not allowing for any
friction friction would point up or down
the inclined plane we're only allowing
for this normal force well up to now
what we would have done was take this
force and break it into vertical and
horizontal components it turns out
that's not the best way to solve this
problem because we know from experience
that this block is going to slide down
the ramp it's not going to slide
straight to the right or straight up or
straight down it's going to slide in
this direction so that's the direction
we should care about and how do we care
about a direction well instead of
breaking this force down we break the
weight down we replace this downwards
force with a force perpendicular to the
surface which I've indicated with this
little perpendicular symbol here and a
force parallel which I've indicated with
these two parallel lines now the thing
that's really cool is that if this plane
was inclined at an angle alpha we can do
some geometry to show that this angle
here inside this triangle is also equal
to alpha and since this here is a right
angle we can do trigonometry in fact if
we want to look at the sine of this
angle for example well that's going to
equal opposite over adjacent so f
parallel over mg and when we solve that
we find that F parallel is just mg times
the sine
this angle and we can do similar
thinking to show that F perpendicular is
mg times the cosine of the angle now
let's think about what's going on here
well I know that a block on a plane like
this is going to slide this way it won't
jump off the plane and it won't
accelerate down into the plane okay so
that means that this direction the
forces are all set they're balanced F n
must equal F perpendicular in fact the
only unbalanced force here is this
parallel force and this parallel force
since it's unbalanced is what's causing
the acceleration it's must be equal to
MA well we can plug in what we know F
parallels mg sine theta so this must be
true and this tells me that the
acceleration of an object sliding down
an inclined plane is equal to G times
the sine of theta now that's very
amazing this number sine of theta is
always between zero and one it's always
going to make G smaller so this is
exactly why Galileo chose inclined
planes they slow down acceleration they
make it smaller than G now this was a
lot of material if you have any
questions go to the forums and ask now
we're going to move on to a couple more
problem set problems</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
