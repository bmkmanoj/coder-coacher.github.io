done so far we started with the question
can we identify people based on their
location patterns then we decided to use
linear methods to do sofyan we wanted to
use a Euclidean distance measured over
different times of the day as our
features we clean the data we selected
the features and we made sure we have
enough data to build our model let's
come back to the question of using the
Euclidean distance first let's define
what this distance is the Euclidean
distance is the distance we can measure
between two points let's say these two
points are 0.1 given by the coordinates
x1 and y1 and a point 2 given by the
coordinates x2 and y2 our goal is to
measure the distance of the line joining
point 1 and point 2 this distance
between point 1 and point 2 can be
written as the square root of the sum of
the squares of the difference of the
coordinates so in this case it's X 1
minus X 2 squared plus y 1 minus y 2
squared in the data we started with x
and y coordinates from the X&amp;amp;Y
coordinates we made a transformation to
calculate a distance between the x and y
coordinates for each position at a given
time and some arbitrary origin point
which we do not hear as 0 0 notice we
took two variables x and y and
transformed it into one variable which
was the distance function we did not
necessarily have to do this we could
have used x and y independently as
features and still done the analysis on
the other hand we could have also used a
different distance function in the next
video we will investigate using a
different distance function but before
we do so let's get back to our ipython
notebooks calculate these distances to
be used as our features in our model
getting back to the ipython
here we have the code that calculates
the Euclidean distance between the two
points we do this for all the points in
our data set running this part of the
code sets the distance metric to be our
Euclidean distance this is what we will
use for the classification problem in
the next part of the code we'll
calculate each person's distance from
the origin at 4 5 6 &amp;amp; 7 p.m. every day
these are the four different hours we
have chosen to get our locations the
people or the driver ID will be our
classes Y we will use the values of X to
learn values of Y in the function here
we are filling out to areas of x and y
in X we append the distances and in Y we
append the person IDs the method in the
end returns us to areas of x and y after
running the above code we now want to
check what the data holds for each of
the persons running this part of the
code should result in a list of the
persons and the number of events we are
left with for each of these person so
after running this we now have a list of
the name of the person with the number
of events the number of data points our
events have reduced significantly
because we have chosen to use only four
different times of day when we collect
the location information we do not use
the data from the other times</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
