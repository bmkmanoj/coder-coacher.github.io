you've said I've left out the most
important parts and you are right so I'm
gonna tell you how to construct the most
important parts let's start with the
distribution so let's start with the
base case and that is the distribution
at the beginning of time d sub1 so this
distribution is going to be over each of
the examples and those examples are
indexed so over I and I'm simply going
to set that distribution to be uniform
so how many examples do we have Michael
it's let's pick a let's pick a letter
let's call it in okay
why not because we do that for
everything else and I'm gonna say that
for every single one of the examples
they happen one over N times that is
it's a uniform distribution now why do I
do that because I have no reason to
believe for the purposes of this
algorithm that any given example is
better than any other example more
important any other example harder than
any other example or anything else I
know nothing so see if you can learn
over all of the examples you with me
yeah because I feel like if it actually
solves that problem we're just done so
and that's what you always want but
that's the easy case so I start out with
the uniform distribution that's what you
usually do when you don't know anything
but what are you gonna do while you're
in the middle so here's what I'm gonna
do Michael at every time step T I'm
going to construct a new distribution D
sub T plus one okay so here's how we're
going to construct the distribution at
every time step okay I'm going to create
the new distribution t plus 1 to be eat
for each example I to be the old
distribution at times T times e to the
minus alpha T times y sub I times H of
sub t of X of I all divided by Z sub T
so that's pretty obvious right
so what each of those what each of those
terms mean I mean I know it's
intuitively obvious even to the most
casual observer but but let me just try
to explain what each of the parts mean
so we know that the D is our
distribution and it's some number where
over all the examples it adds up to one
and it's a stand-in we know because I
said this at the beginning for how
important a particular example is how
often we expect to see it that's the
trick that we're using with
distributions
so I'm gonna take the old distribution
for an example of for a particular
example and I'm going to either make it
bigger or smaller based upon how well
the current hypothesis does on that
particular example so there's a cute
little trick here we know that H of T
always returns a value of either minus 1
or plus 1 because that's how we defined
our training set you always have a label
of minus 1 or plus 1 so HT is going to
return minus 1 or plus 1 for a
particular X of I Y of I which is the
label with respect to that example is
also always going to be plus 1 or minus
1 and alpha T is a constant which I will
get into a little bit later just right
now think of it as a number and so what
happens Michael if the hypothesis at
time T for a particular example X of I
agrees with the label that is associated
with that X of I well hang on you say
the Alpha is a number is it a positive
number between 0 and 1 number and
negative number what kind of number that
does it not matter I think that's a good
question
it matters eventually but right now that
number is always positive positive all
right so like a scale almost like a
learning rate e kind of thing maybe
that's a learning rate II kind of thing
sort of all right so good so the Y okay
I see I see so the Y times the H is
gonna be 1 if they agree and minus 1 if
they disagree exactly so if they both
say positive 1 positive 1 times positive
1 is 1 if they both say negative 1
negative 1 times negative 1 is 1 so it's
exactly what you say when they agree
that number is 1 and when they disagree
that number is minus 1 alpha sub T which
I defined below is always a positive
number you can trust me on this the
error is always between 0 and 1 and it
just turns out that the natural log of 1
minus the number between 0 and 1 over
that number always gives you a positive
number and if you don't believe me you
should play around with the numbers do
you convince yourself so that's going to
be some positive number so that means
when they agree that whole product will
be positive which means you'll be
raising e to minus some number when they
disagree that product will be negative
which means you will be raising e to
some positive number so let's imagine
they agree so you're going to be raising
e to minus some number what's going to
happen to the relative way of D sub T of
I</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
