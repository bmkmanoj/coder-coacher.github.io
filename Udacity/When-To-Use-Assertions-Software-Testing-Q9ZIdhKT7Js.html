quote from Julie and C word the author
of the valgrind tool and if you haven't
used valgrind and if you're a C or C++
developer you really should it's an
amazing tool that runs dynamic checks on
your running program and it looks for
errors such as mel pointed references
out of bounds array accesses and other
things he said this code is absolutely
loaded with assertions and these are
permanently enabled as valgrind has
become more widely used they have shown
they're worth pulling up various bugs
which would otherwise have appeared is
hard to find segmentation faults I am of
the view that it's acceptable to spend
five percent of the total running time
doing assertion checks so Julian saying
here is that he's going to cost
everybody five percent of total running
time in order to make testing and
debugging evelopment easier included
this somewhat long quote because I
really agree with Julian here I think
it's generally worth our time to try to
make our code fail early fail fast
rather than keeping going and failing
and confusing ways later or even
providing people with completely wrong
results on the other hand let's imagine
that we're working at NASA or someplace
like that and we're writing software
it's going to be controlling a spaceship
as it lands on Mars or some other planet
we have to ask ourselves the question do
we want to naples assertion checks for
this kind of a mission and so I actually
talked to a NASA engineer some time ago
who had worked on the software for one
of the Mars missions and what he told me
was for most of the mission that is to
say for the launch phase for the cruise
phase for orbiting Mars they had plenty
of assertions enabled in the actual
mission software that is to say in the
software running on the spacecraft on
the other hand for a short period of
time during which the spacecraft was
actually landing they disabled all of
the assertions on the idea that they got
only one shot to land on the planet and
then if anything went wrong with the
software during the landing process it
was better to just try to keep going
because an assertion violation leading
to a system reset could cause the lander
to become unstable in such a way that
wouldn't have been recoverable so that
gives us a summary if you're doing
something so critical that it keeps
going that it resembles landing a
spaceship on Mars then go ahead and turn
off assertions in your production
software otherwise you're probably
better off leaving them unable</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
