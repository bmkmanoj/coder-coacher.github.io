looking at something that's slightly
outside the boundaries of the material
that we've looked at so far we're going
to investigate the decay chain of
uranium-238 this chain contains a number
of different steps from one isotope down
to the next so for example we go from
uranium 238 to a string of other things
that we're not going to think about
right now until eventually we get to
bismuth 210 plus some radioactive
radiation over here that we're not going
to be concerned with now business 210
has a half-life of five days and it
eventually decays to polonium 210 plus
again some radiation and this has a
half-life of 138 days after sometime it
decays to lead-206 and we can say that
in general the average lifetime of a
given isotope is equal to its half-life
divided by the natural log of 2 if you
want to figure this out you're welcome
to or you can just trust me that it's
right it will be useful for us to think
about how the number of atoms in a given
sample changes over time if we think of
the initial amount of atoms as equaling
100% of that amount then when T equals
the half-life we have half of those
atoms left over here we see the average
lifetime marked out of course there are
still some atoms left but many of them
already decayed looking at the supplied
code you can see that we're actually
ignoring the part of the chain that
starts with uranium 238 and beginning is
said with the bismuth isotope our
initial values show that all of the
atoms are bismuth at first and none of
them are polonium and none of them are
LED what we would like you to do is to
use the backward euler remember backward
euler is not the same as forward euler
to show how this decay process happens
for each population of atoms one more
hint think about how the idea of
logistic growth applies to this
situation and how that's going to affect
the different rates of change of these
populations</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
