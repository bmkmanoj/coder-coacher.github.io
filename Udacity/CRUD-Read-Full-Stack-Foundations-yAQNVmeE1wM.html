empty let's start reading from it in the
last video you saw me call session data
query restaurant at all if I create a
variable called first result and set it
equal to session query restaurant and
use dot first this time I now have a
variable that corresponds to a single
row in my database these single row
references allow me to extract column
entries as method names so if I were to
write first result dot name I'm given
the name of my restaurant object as it
is stored in the database currently I
only have one restaurant and one menu
items stored in my database well that's
kind of boring but with the help from
some fellow you Dacians I've created a
Python script that will populate my
database with several different
restaurants and menu items popular
amongst the Udacity team download the
lots of menus my script into your
working directory and execute it from
the command line is so now when we
perform executions like session query
restaurant at all we get back a whole
list of results so what happens when I
have a query that returns a collection
of results and we want to display column
information for each item for this we
can use a Python for loop to return the
data that we want to see here let's do
an example I will make a variable called
items and set it equal to a query that
retrieves all of my menu items now I can
say for item in items print item name
now I get back a printed line of each
item name in our database SQL alchemy
has an extensive collection of queries
we can perform on our database take some
time to explore the query documentation
here and play around with the database
for a while when you're ready move on to
some of the challenge problems in the
next section</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
