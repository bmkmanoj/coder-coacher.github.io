in whether a particular Turing machine
recognizes or decides a language rather
we're interested in whether there is a
Turing machine that can recognize or
decide the language therefore we say
that a language is recognizable if there
is a Turing machine that recognizes it
and we say that a language is decidable
if there is a Turing machine that
decides now looking at this someone
might object shouldn't we say
recognizable by a Turing machine and
decidable by a Turing machine well of
course we could and the statements would
still be true but we don't and the
reason we don't is that we strongly
believe that if anything can do it a
Turing machine can that's the
church-turing thesis so in some absolute
sense we believe that a language is only
recognizable by anything if a Turing
machine can recognize it and a language
is only decidable by anything if a
Turing machine can decide it and we use
terms that reflect this belief now other
terms are sometimes used instead of
recognizable and decidable
some say that Turing machines compute
languages so to go along with that they
say that languages are computable if
there's a Turing machine that computes
them another equivalent term for
decidable is recursive mathematicians
often prefer this word and those who use
that term will refer to recognizable
languages as recursively enumerable some
also called these languages turning
acceptable or semi or partially
decidable we should also make clear the
relationship between these two terms if
a language is decidable then it's also
recognizable the same Turing machine
works for both it feels like it should
also be true that if a language is
recognizable and its complement is also
recognizable then the language is
decidable this is true but there's a
potential pitfall here that we need to
make sure to avoid</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
