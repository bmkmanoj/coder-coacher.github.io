this data set a little bit more and what
I really mean here is let's get a little
bit better understanding of the
OpenStreetMap project itself and get
started learning what we need to know in
order to do this particular case study
okay so I'm actually going to go ahead
and submit a search for Chicago to
openstreetmap and you'll see that I get
a number of different results here the
one I'm interested in is this one the
city boundary of Chicago Cook County
Illinois United States of America doing
this is essentially going to select from
the OpenStreetMap data set just that
data that has to do with the city of
Chicago so I'm going to click through to
this you can see the outline here that
identifies the city boundary and so the
data that I would be working with is
anything that falls in here so now if I
click export what's going to happen is
that I'll see the latitude longitude and
it's going to tell me this is too large
we go export it okay but then if I
scroll down I can see that there are
actually already prepared extracts from
this data set okay so let me make this a
little bit bigger now what this is is
pre-prepared extracts from this
particular data set and these are
extracts for major metropolitan areas so
you can see I've actually clicked on the
Chicago link before i'm going to go
ahead and click on that and then here i
have an opportunity to download a zipped
up version of this osm data as xml so i
click on that and it begins downloading
and once it's done downloading then we
can go ahead and take a look at it all
right our data is downloaded I am going
to take a look at it you take my
downloads directory I've already
unzipped it and here it is lots and lots
and lots of XML data this should look
somewhat familiar to you we've seen
these node tags before and we've
actually extracted little data from this
data set previously okay i'm going to
use the shell command LS see what the
size of this data set is you can see
here that it's about 1.8 giga bytes so
this is a huge data set what this means
is that in order to process this data we
can't really read it into memory and so
as you'll see a little bit later on
we're going to use an approach to
parsing this that uses a sax parser
which we did look at a little bit in a
previous lesson okay so now what I
usually do in a situation
this is I explore the data itself a
little bit I might even write a little
code to parse out a little bit of what's
here just so I can get a feel for it the
next thing then that will want to do is
to read enough documentation to answer
any questions that we have or at least
enough to get us started okay so what
I'm going to do here then is simply
query for openstreetmap documentation
and I can see that there's actually a
wiki for openstreetmap so if I click
through to that I land on the wiki page
which gives me quite a bit of
information about openstreetmap now I'm
going to make this ridiculously big so
that you can see it on your screen and
if we scroll down you can see there's a
lot to read here so you can see there's
a beginner's guide information for
developers and other pieces of
information map features that sort of
thing I know from having looked at this
page before that there's actually
documentation on the XML format which is
going to be useful to us as we move
forward this provides an example of the
different sorts of tags that you're
going to see in this data set and a
little bit of an explanation about it
for example we can see from this
documentation that this data is
essentially instances of three different
data primitives data primitives being
notes ways and relations and if we click
through to any one of these will get a
little bit more information about them
ok so I encourage you to take a look at
this documentation for yourself make
sure you understand nodes ways and
relations and you'll be in good shape to
move on just do a little bit of reading
for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
