concept to speed up object display
called back face culling imagine you're
looking at a box here's the side view in
2d only the sides of the box that face
toward you are visible the back pieces
here and here do not need to be rendered
the fastest polygons to render is the
one you don't ever have to render at all
back face culling can throw away about
half the faces in an object so it's a
worthwhile optimization for example
here's a real live box if you look at it
from any angle you're only going to see
a few of the faces of the whole box and
the rest of the faces can be thrown away
back faces can be cold for any solid
object this V shape seen from the side
has only two sides facing towards the
camera outlined in green these other two
faces can be thrown away without further
processing it turns out this green face
here is hidden from view by this front
face but we let the z-buffer take care
of hiding that we can set whether back
face culling is enabled or disabled but
how do we determine if a triangle is a
front face or a back face there are just
three points defining each triangle and
there's no flag stored for additional
information what determines front or
back facing is the order of the vertices
after they're projected onto the screen
in WebGL if the order is
counterclockwise the triangles front
facing if it's clockwise its back facing
going counterclockwise like this is
often called the right hand rule the
fingers of your right hand wrap around
the edges of the triangle in order if
your thumb points at you the triangle is
then front facing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
