concrete case consider some of the
operating systems we currently have or
had in case of ms-dos thank God so what
exactly I said you know the OS portion
and user portion of the address space
how does it work in these systems so for
example if you look at the address space
layout for 32-bit Linux lower 3
gigabytes is where the user code isn't
data is going to go so address space is
going to be 4 gigabytes long with 32
bits so we're going to separate that and
say one gigabyte for the kernel and
three gigabytes for the user the lower
three gigabytes that's where the user
code data is the top one gigabyte is
where the colonel goes and there's this
fence between these two the colonel
portion can only be accessed when you
are in the operating system or in the
colonel another thing to keep in mind is
that these portions of address space
that we have access to those address
spaces also is related to what execution
mode or privilege ring you are in so x86
has a zero through three for you to be
able to access the colonel portion you
have to be in ring 0 or in system mode
if you are executing user code in drink
3 you can access this portion of the
address space that we have which is the
one gigabyte so this can expect the
hardware support that we have in the
address space layout that you're talking
about so these other operating systems
you know depending on what particular
version may have some differences but
typically this is how it works the
operating system is common so this
kernel one gigabyte is you know has the
same data and code for every process but
the three gigabyte is for process
obviously this is a could be different
for different processes and we said if
you're executing this part of the three
gigabyte then you are in ring three if
you're executing the colonel you are in
ring 0 this is how operating systems
manage access to various part of the
address space well so modern operating
systems actually separate the trusted
computing base from untrusted it wasn't
always like that if you look at ms-dos
and actually now it's in a museum you
can they
microsoft even sort of the first version
they made the source code available
actually written assembly language it
didn't have this separation that we're
talking about there is no sort of fence
or wall between the user and and and and
system code so any process could
actually alter the operating system
because you can freely march down into
the OS face and if you happen to be
virus you obviously could hook anything
including you know here talks with
interrupt handlers actually are always
in the operating system we're talking
about dealing with hardware devices and
access direct access to hardware is
through foolish instructions not from
user level those instructions have to be
foolish so here you could actually you
know change the colonel change the
interp and leurs there was no protection
that modern operating systems provide
through this isolation of the operating
system from application code</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
