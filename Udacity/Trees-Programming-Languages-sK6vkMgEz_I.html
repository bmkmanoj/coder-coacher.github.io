to practice your programming skills and
today we're going to take a look at a
problem that's important for physical
devices like yearbooks in a school or
phone books or really any sorted index
and the problem we're going to cover
this time is how to organize and search
through sorted information and the
approach I want to take is to use a tree
and we've seen trees before in some
computer science programming on the
particular kind of tree I'm going to
focus on is one that has two branches at
every level suppose I have a number of
friends that I want to keep track of in
my yearbook or in a telephone book I
could use a Python list to include all
four of their names are all four of
those elements and I can check to see if
an element is in a list in Python just
by using the keyword in putting the
element on the left and the list on the
right but we might wonder what is Python
doing behind the scenes how is this
implemented in practice one way to do it
and the way we'll explore today is to
build up a special kind of tree holding
all of the information that I want to
see I'm going to start with the first
element of my list and make it the root
or the top of the tree let me sketch out
the rest so the tree is easier to see
I've added the elements from my list one
two three and four to this tree and I've
put them in a special order
corresponding to how they'd fall in
English alphabetical order so since the
J and Jacob comes before the M in
Margaret I've made Jacob the left child
in Margaret since the N in Nelson comes
after the M in Margaret k l m n o P yes
I can remember the English alphabet I've
made it to the right child and the a and
Alice follows all the way down here to
the left I'm gonna construct a special
tree to store information like this that
has a number of properties the first to
just summarize or formalize this
ordering intuition we had above
everything to the left of Margaret and
all the way down is less than or equal
to comes before in the alphabet is a
smaller number than if I'm store
phone numbers instead the information
stored at Margaret's node Jacob and
Alice both come before Margaret in the
alphabet so they're both on the left and
similarly right subtrees contain only
information that's greater than or equal
to larger later in the alphabet Nelson
comes after Margaret so it's here on the
right and then finally and this is
really important both the left and the
right subtrees also fall follow rules
one two and three it is Turtles all the
way down that makes this tree something
special in computer science a recursive
data structure we've already seen
recursive functions that are defined in
terms of themselves now I'm talking
about a recursive way to lay out data
that's defined in terms of itself</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
