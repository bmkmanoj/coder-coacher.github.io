used in this lesson and we're only going
to keep using them more so I think it's
time that you learn how to use math
quill to write logs in a pretty way now
this should be pretty similar to some
other functions you've seen written in
math quill and of course you get plenty
of practice using this let's say for
example that I wanted to write log base
4 of X well in mouth call here is what i
would type in back / l 0 g then the
space bar then to get down into the
subscript space where the four is
written need to press shift and then
hold it down while you type the minus
sign key that's is going to shift you
down here then you can write a little
for just to the bottom rate of the log
to get out of the space and back to
where we're going to write the input for
the log press the arrow key to the right
you could also press tab instead then
type your input which in this case is X
now since you've seen one example I
think it would make sense for you to try
one yourself how would you type log base
3 of X plus 4 in my vehicle in the box
that appears down here try it out you
should be able to tell based on how it
looks whether or not it's going to be
right you could also use the box down
here to try out writing some other log
expressions anything you can think of</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
