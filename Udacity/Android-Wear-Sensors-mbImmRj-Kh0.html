the user they're an ideal platform to
implement Fitness applications these
types of applications typically use
sensors on the device to measure step
counts acceleration and position the
good news is that Android wear uses
exactly the same sensor API as regular
Android phones and tablets so you can
reuse all your existing knowledge about
sensors here as well let's look at a
sample to see how it works a good one is
called jumping jack so let's create a
project around that and test it in this
case I'm gonna use a real watch to test
it out and show you how it works right
now it has a zero on the counter shown
in the activity so let's do a few
jumping jacks 1 2 3 and now you can see
that it's counted the values correctly
so what is different about working with
sensors on Android wear well the main
differences come down to saving battery
power and not doing too much processing
on the wearable device let's go through
some best practices for sensors on
Android wear you want to do as little
work as possible so unregister your
listener when you don't need it for a
running app we only want to log steps
when the user is running the actual
activity for the rest of the day when
the activity is not running we should
put the device to sleep and use the
standard watch face saving power the
next thing is to select an appropriate
update rate if you're only going to
refresh the display every minute then
there's no point getting updates 10
times per second and you might also want
to request that the results are batched
up over this time period so that the CPU
can stay asleep the whole time the
register listener method allows you to
control these factors also make sure if
you need to process the data try to do
as much on the phone as possible
remember phone has a huge battery
compared to the little wearable here so
take advantage of that if you're trying
to measure the bumpiness of a car ride
and you know the web where user has
their phone with them why not use the
accelerometer and the phone to do the
logging instead of the wearable the GPS
feature in Android wear does exactly
this if you have the phone and the
wearable in close proximity it will
actually use the phone's GPS unit if the
wearable goes out on a run while the
phone stays at home and if the device
has a GPS built in it'll use the GPS
from the wearable there is a sample for
this called speed tracker check it out
for yourself and see how it's
implemented one new sensor that was
introduced in KitKat phones and
available on all wearables is the step
counter this is really useful for
Fitness applications and is a low-power
sensor you can use often it is also a
lot more efficient than trying to build
your own step counter by reading the
accelerometers the Android step counter
is provided by dedicated hardware you'll
notice in the documentation there is a
type step detector and a type step
counter the detector is configured to
trigger every time a step is made but
it's possible that you will not receive
the events if the device is sleeping you
also don't want to have the device wake
up and run your code after every single
step like at these points here
especially if you only want to refresh
the display every minute so the step
counter here is a much better idea it
gives you an absolute value so your code
does not need to wake up on every step
and you cannot miss any steps because
you always get the absolute value each
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
