going to go back to the menu example we
started with and asked you to define
classes that provide behavior that will
allow us to represent main dishes and
appetizers so both main dishes and
appetizers have some properties in
common they all have names and prices
and they both might have a description
as well as an indication of whether
they're appropriate for vegetarians or
not these have default values of none
and false and main dish comes with
slides and the default number of sides
is zero an appetizer doesn't come with
any sides but it serves a variable
number of people the default being one
so your goal is to find a dish module
that will provide this behavior it will
define types for at least the main dish
and appetizer will be able to create a
main dish passing in a name a price and
then optional description and vegetarian
parameters when we print out a main dish
will see the name of the dish followed
by the price if there is a description
will see that here's another example of
a main dish this one has two sides and
is vegetarian and when we print this out
we'll see the star meaning it's
vegetarian and that it has two sides we
can also create appetizers and
appetizers have names prices might have
a description might have vegetarian and
might have the number of people they
serve and we can print out an appetizer
and it'll print out the name the price
extra information like a dish would as
well as the number that it serves here's
another example we're creating an
appetizer with a description that serves
three and we'll see it prints out the
description followed by the serfs so
your goal is to define a module that
provides this behavior and to do it in a
way that reuses code as much as possible
you want to avoid having any unnecessary
duplication of code doing this well
we'll take advantage of several of the
things that I've introduced in this
class</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
