everyday software development practice
as such what has been learned about how
to perform them what follows in this
lesson are some do's and don'ts gleaned
from actual experience we begin with
some about the participants first off
review should not be used for personnel
and evaluations if participants feel
that what they say about someone else's
code will affect their performance
rating or salary they may be reluctant
to speak for this reason managers should
in general not attend review meetings
unless they have participated
technically in the production of the
artifact being reviewed or they are
outside of the participants reporting
hierarchy similarly in general is not a
good idea to allow non participant
observers in review meetings as they can
provide distractions don't treat a
review as an opportunity for training
new staff members this will reduce the
productivity of the review session
instead hold a separate meeting with the
trainee the author of the artifact being
reviewed should not be the moderator or
recording these are specialized tasks
that require full concentration some
organizations also require that the
author not be the reader</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
