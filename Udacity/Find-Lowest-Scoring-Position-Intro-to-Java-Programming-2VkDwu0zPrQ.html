nice because we already had these
methods and we could just use them and
this almost reads like a kind of English
now what's the low score find the low
score remove the low score but these
first two steps were kind of repetitive
in this example we had to go through
every item to find what the lowest one
was and then go through them again to
find the index of it if this were a very
long array with millions of items in it
we wouldn't want to have to go through
all of the data twice just to get the
location we would want to think a little
deeper and try to combine some of these
loops so what if we had a method get low
score position that would replace the
two steps of finding the minimum element
and also finding its index</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
