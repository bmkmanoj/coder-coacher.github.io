important especially the red blood cells
because we hear about them all the time
but what exactly do blood cells do well
red blood cells are one of the most
populous cell types in your body because
they carry out a very important function
there's a very special molecule inside
red blood cells called hemoglobin that
binds oxygen and carries it to all the
cracks and crevices in your body its
role is to actually go to all these
places and exchange oxygen for carbon
dioxide it's the gas waste of our bodies
and even the shape everything about a
red blood cell is essentially tailored
to help maximize the efficiency of
exchanging oxygen for carbon dioxide but
then what does that have to do with
blood type why does that matter that's a
great question blood type doesn't
directly affect any oxygen consumption
but on the surface of red blood cells
like most cells in your body they're
covered with different molecules that
determine the blood cells type as we
call it this carbohydrate may or may not
be modified to have three different
types the addition of an a antigen the
addition of a B antigen or no addition
at all and whichever combination of
these antigens you have is called your
blood type now the protein that modifies
the carbohydrate is an enzyme a protein
itself an enzyme is anything that
catalyzes a biological reaction so if
you look and see this enzyme adding the
a antigen or the B antigen or no antigen
where do you think this enzyme this
protein comes from</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
