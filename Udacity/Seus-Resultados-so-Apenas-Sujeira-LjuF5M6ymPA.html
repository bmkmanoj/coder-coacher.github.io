the Udacity student data and started to
uncover some relationships between the
variables it's time to move on to
drawing conclusions or making
predictions you've probably already
started to draw some tentative
conclusions for example that students
who pass the subway project spend more
minutes in the classroom during their
first week than students who don't
however even if there was no real
difference between students who passed
their project and students who didn't
you wouldn't expect the two means to be
exactly equal how can you tell if the
difference you saw is a true difference
or if it's due to noise in the data the
differences we saw looked pretty large
so it may be hard to imagine that this
could be due to noise but intuition
doesn't always work very well in these
situations to rigorously check how
likely it would be to see these results
by random chance you need to use
statistics to learn more about how to do
this check out Udacity statistics course
linked in the instructor notes for now
we're not going to go further in this
directions and statistics isn't required
to take this course but keep in mind
that the results we have our only
tentative they haven't been validated</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
