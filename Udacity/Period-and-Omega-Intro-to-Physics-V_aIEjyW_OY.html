this question at least a couple but I'm
going to show you two the period is two
seconds and we're talking about 7.5
seconds if our math starts off up here
well after two seconds it's complete one
period two more it's gone up here two
more another period okay so so far we've
had six seconds elapsed
well after seven seconds that's half a
period and then another half a second
well that's another half of what's left
we'd wind up here how else could we have
solved this remember that the amount of
angle we go through in a certain amount
of time is equal to Omega times T okay
well I know that T is 7.5 seconds how
can I find Omega well we have this
relationship T equals 2 PI over Omega or
rearranged Omega equals two PI over T so
in this case with a T of 2 Omega is
equal to just PI radians per second that
means in each second it's going to go PI
radians well seven PI radians would be
seven halves of a circle so starting
from here that would be this angle one
half two three four five six and seven
but it was 7.5 seconds so that extra PI
over two radians and again that puts us
right here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
