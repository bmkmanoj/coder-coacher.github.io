part of the lecture is that the basic
element we want to be able to do
analysis on most of the time in a 3d
scene is rays of light and we want to be
able to use the rays of light to be able
to extract information so here's a
beautiful image of a son that actually
if you see this image basically all of
the rays of light are coming in and we
want to be able to kind of model a lot
more information about how rays of light
from this light source are hitting
different parts of a scene and of course
it's because of the phenomenon of this
being hit these three branches being hit
and that's being able to see it that
kind of gives us the more visual feel of
the scene so we've looked at previously
and we've talked about the whole concept
that basically an image is a 2d array of
pixels and that's how we actually
capture a 3d scene into a 2d image but
we want to remember that the fundamental
primitives at least in the whole
analysis of a picture of computational
photography process is raised we want to
be able to kind of look at information
that's coming and hitting the scene and
then of course getting reflected and we
want to be able to capture as much
information from the environment based
on the illumination and the rays that
are hitting the scene one of the things
that's important when you start thinking
about rays of light is that basically
they follow a path from the source to
the scene so therefore we can start
using things like geometry of the rays
of light to be able to extract
information about what the scene is like
and more importantly what we're
interested in is how we can actually use
computation that can control all
parameters of how the optics and the
sensor that is the way the process of
illumination goes rays of light to go
through optics to the sensor that
actually allows us to generate those
pixels that we can do image processing
on so one of the important things for us
to remember now is that we want to be
able to use computation to control how
the illumination which would then create
the rays of light that would be then
controlled again with the optics to
create information on a sensor that
would generate the pixels that we
actually will be doing processing on to
be able to generate an image</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
