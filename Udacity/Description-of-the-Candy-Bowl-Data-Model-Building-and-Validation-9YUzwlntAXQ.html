data I wanted to take a moment and
describe the data that we collected in
order to perform this analysis so if you
recall the goal is to understand what
influences consumer choice in this case
the influencers of candy selection and
so we elected to record any attributes
which we thought might possibly have an
impact on selection preference so each
record correspondent to someone
selecting a candy for each record the
attributes that we thought to collect
which might have an influence on candy
preference were name gender the type of
candy we lumped color and flavor into
one giant category age of the person
who's selecting and ethnicity of the
selector now in addition to that
attributes in order to establish a
baseline we also wanted to include a
spurious attribute that way any
attribute that was ranked as having a
weak relationship than that one we know
that we could safely ignore it so as our
selection of a spurious attribute we
chose shirts color I think we can all
agree that shirt color shouldn't have an
impact on what candy someone selects so
when we're evaluating the strength of
relationships of any one of these are
other attributes to candy choice we know
that if it has a weaker relationship
than that of shirt color we can safely
ignore it now in addition the records
are chronological meaning that the
records appear and the order in which
selections were made now that you know
what all the attributes mean go grab a
hold of the data yourself so that you
can follow along while we do the
analysis</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
