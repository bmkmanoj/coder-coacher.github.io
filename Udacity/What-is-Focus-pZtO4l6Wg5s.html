focus determines where keyboard events
go in the page to give me an example if
I go over and focus this text input
field using my mouse and then begin
typing the input receives the keyboard
events and displays the characters as
I've typed them the currently focused
item is often indicated by a focus ring
where the actual styling of that ring
depends on the browser and any
additional styling that the page author
may have applied as a user you can
control which element is currently
focused using your keyboard pressing the
tab key will move focus forward through
the document shift tab moves focus
backwards and you can use the arrow keys
to move focus around within a component
on Mac OS X this works a little
differently while chrome will always let
you navigate with tab you'll need to
press option tab in order to change
focus in other browsers like Safari if
you'd like you can change this by going
to your system preferences going to the
keyboard section clicking on the
shortcuts tab and then changing this
radio group to say all controls to give
you an example of focus in the real
world Here I am on Wikipedia and as I
press the tab key the browser is going
to navigate through all of the focusable
elements on the page
eventually I'll reach a stopping point
and hit shift tab and now I'm moving
backwards through the page this ordering
is called creatively enough the tab
order and making sure your application
has a logical tab order is an important
step which we're gonna cover later on in
this course now built an interactive
HTML elements like input button and
select are all implicitly focusable
meaning that they're automatically
inserted in the tab order and that they
also have built-in keyboard event
handling but not all elements are
focusable this header the paragraph
below it and this image are not
focusable and they're not implicitly
inserted in the tab order and that's by
design there's generally no need to
focus something if a user can't interact
with it or provide it some sort of input</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
