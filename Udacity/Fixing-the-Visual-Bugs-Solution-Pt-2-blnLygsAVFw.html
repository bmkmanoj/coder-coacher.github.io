and shake the phone to shake gesture mmm
a little weird this time the spiders did
flee from the screen but instead of
spreading out readily from the center
they crossed over the middle to exit off
the screen and that's not how it should
work they should be spreading out
readily from the center let's look at
that again will create some more spiders
whoa okay looks like we have another
problem maybe the bugs aren't being
deleted but we'll look at that in just a
second let's shake it again and yet
that's the same problem so this is
probably related to the dispersed
animation let's go ahead and take a look
so I'll stop this point just need to
stop for a second here's the disperse
bugs animation and we can see that we're
setting the off-screen position and
whatever this off-screen position is
being set to that's what we're trying to
update the bug frame to is this new
off-screen position it's causing the
bugs to cross over the middle of the web
so right now we're taking the bugs
center coordinate to calculate this
off-screen position we're taking the bug
center coordinate the X and we're
subtracting it from the view center
coordinate for X and then we're
multiplying it by negative 20 and we're
doing the same thing for the why we're
taking the bug sentir y and then the
views center it's why and we're also
multiplying it by negative 20 so let's
try this calculation by hand and see
what it really looks like so let's say
that we have this fictitious view and
spider and that the spiders Center its X
is maybe 180 and let's say D view
sinners it's X is maybe 150 and if we
subtract these two values we get
positive 30 and if we multiply that by
negative 20 we get negative six hundred
and with a new center value of negative
six hundred this would cause the spider
to move all the way from its position
where it currently is across
us the center to some point all the way
over here on the left so I think that's
our problem instead I think if we
multiply maybe by a positive value we
can move to the right away from the
center instead of left across the center
so let's go back to the code now and fix
this so I'll change these two positive
20s and let's rebuild and run again
create a bunch of spiders and simulate
shaking the device and nice there we go
all the spiders are now running away in
a radial pattern like we wanted now
there's one last bug which I think
you've noted it's maybe more of a lack
of implementation instead of a bug but
when we tried shaking the bugs and then
created some more we noticed all these
bugs came running back onto the screen
so where are these extra bucks coming
from my thoughts maybe we're forgetting
to move them so let's just check back in
the visual debug controller and see if
our hunch is correct so we go to the
empty bugs from view that's where this
should be happening there we go my bad I
left a message to remind myself and I
haven't done it to empty the bugs from
the view in this case I'll forgive you
if you copy the code over from the final
working version because that's what I'm
about to do this should just be a simple
fix so if we go up d bugs from view here
we go let's work that in try it one more
time and create some bugs shake them off
the screen and if we create some more
there should be no new bugs crawling
back on looks good let's do a couple
different types of bugs just for
checking sake shake them off and
everything looks good and that's it
that's all the bugs that I know that are
in the visual debugging scene and I hope
you're able to find and fix all these
bugs on your own but most importantly I
hope that your confidence is growing so
that you can go forth and when you're
faced with bugs like this or any bugs in
your application you know what tools are
available to you and you can use them to
debug your applications</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
