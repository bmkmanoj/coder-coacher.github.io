a bit of a spambot so let's take an
email address let's take my email
address and let's say I post this on the
internet but I don't want an automatic
robot to go from every page see my email
address and then starts handing spam so
I come up with the solution to insert
the characters no spam somewhere in my
email address and presumably a crawling
spam bot won't be able to notice that
this isn't actually part of my email
address and i put that in there just as
a distraction but a human will see my
email address realize that no spam isn't
actually part of my email address I mean
who would really put that there and just
email to pee Chapman at Udacity com well
what we're going to do is build our
lexer such that it matches email
addresses and the value that of the
token that it returns is going to remove
no spam from it so what are we going to
need we're going to need to find our
tokens and presumably we're going to
have one called email remember that our
tokens are in use all capitalization
just as convention and then we're going
to want to define the function that
matches that token so now we have to
write a regular expression that matches
an email address so the exact
specifications for the email address are
given in the problem specification but
to go over briefly we're going to have a
sequence of letters with any
capitalization followed by an ad sign
and then we can have another sequence of
letters followed by at least one dot and
then more letters possibly followed by
another dot and more letters but it
doesn't end on a dot you need to have
some letters so that's kind of the
verbal walk through which start writing
it out so we want to match the letters
before the ad sign it's going to be this
chunk right here then we're gonna match
the ad sign this bit so this part of a
regular expression is going to match
everything up to the last chunk of
letters this last chunk is called the
top level domains commnet died edu
things like that so we're going to map
with this regular expression everything
before that
and the specification for that is some
letters followed by a period and that
whole thing came repeated as many times
as necessary and at the end we have our
last bit of letters so for whatever this
matches we're going to remove the no
spam and we're going to do that using
the re library which you are hopefully
pretty familiar with by now this method
in particular allows us to replace
matching substrings with other
substrings in this case we're going to
replace all the occurrences of no spam
with nothing also don't forget to define
the error state where if it doesn't
match anything we're just going to skip
it the last thing we need to write is
the code that builds the lexer and runs
it on our given haystack are given text
of the web page or whatnot of email
addresses and for that I'm gonna go to
the ID so here I have the code I just
wrote I declare one token that's the
email the definition matches our regular
expression for email addresses and
removes all the occurrences of no spam I
have something for when you hit an error
where nothing is matched and now I just
need to write the code that builds the
lexer so I'm going to basically follow
what we did in lecture this builds the
lexer now we need to assign at the input
and we're going to go through every
token it matches and fill a list of
results I'm going to call that result so
here i go for every token that we get if
I'm out of tokens I want to break but
for all the ones that we do have I'm
going to append it to the result list
and then return the result list</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
