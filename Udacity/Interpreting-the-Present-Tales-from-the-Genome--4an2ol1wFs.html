you that we can't do anything about for
example we can tell you you have a
susceptibility for breast cancer but
can't tell if you're going to get it we
could tell you perchance that you have a
genetic predisposition for Huntington's
disease and can't really do much about
that either would you want to know if
you had a genetic disorder that's
incurable or would you rather not know
the 23 me website to find out certain
information you have to opt-in you have
to do like a double opt-in and they kind
of go mmm are you sure you want to know
um where do you guys fall in those
categories um and Jenny I'll start with
you I mean you sort of mentioned the
hesitancy previously I mean do you want
to know if you have an incurable disease
or disorder there's a lot of cancer in
my family and because of that I assume
that there's a greater chance of me
having cancer and I guess because I
would want to know if it were a lethal
situation I would want to know not only
to advocate and prepare but to also
prepare for death and my children and
and everything that comes with that I
think that if I could take an action I'd
want to know but I wouldn't want to know
that when I left the house today that I
was the car was going to cross the
median line and hit me head-on and maybe
I wouldn't leave the house maybe that's
something exit is one of those little
paradoxes right for my genetic situation
I can do something about it so I do I
was happy to know and in your case what
did you do well for me finding out that
I had the bracha to mutation I
immediately contact
a breast oncologist who referred me to a
genetic counselor I the test was from
23andme and they verified the test with
another lab just to be sure and it was
confirmed and the recommendation was to
have an oophorectomy as well remove your
ovaries that's when they remove your
ovaries and there's not that greater
risk for ovarian cancer but it's
significant and I did that and the other
recommendation is to see the breast
oncologist twice a year for breast exam
and to also have a breast MRI and a
mammogram once a year and so I'm taking
that action and I'm hoping that at my
age of 70 that
I can beat it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
