mixed strategy is that everyone just
dares chooses to dare with probability
one third oh really yeah that works out
to be a Nash equilibrium I will leave it
as an exercise to the reader to convince
themselves with that but it does
actually work out to be the case huh and
so that means we both okay we both dare
with probably a third which means to
said sherds of time we chicken so
there's going to be some probability
that we both chicken some probability
that I chicken and you don't so I'm
probably that you chicken and I don't
and then the lowest probability is we
both dare boom right so in fact I'm glad
you said that because that's exactly how
we would figure out how good a strategy
this mixed strategy is right so let's do
it so let me ask you a question what's
the probability that we both chicken
four ninths and house you get four
ninths I looked at your notes that's the
problem with being in the same place
when we're doing these recordings well
I'm pretty impressed that you can
actually read my handwriting no I can
not only not read it but my eyes are old
enough that I can't read it anyway even
if you wrote it nicely so know what I
did is I took if the probability of dare
is a third then the probability of
chicken is two thirds and we're
independently choosing that so the
probability that both of us choose it is
two thirds times two-thirds or four
nights so what's the probability of one
person chickening and the other person
daring in particular CD CD so that's
one-third times two-thirds which is two
nights and by symmetry nine seconds oh
sorry two nights mm-hmm and then dare
dare would be one ninth because it's
dare times dare right and let's just
double-check that four or five six seven
eight nine wait don't not one third the
bottom thing oh thank you so much okay
oh and so now we can figure out from
this what are expected let's say my
expected reward would be for playing
this Nash equilibrium right so let's say
your player one so this is you so then
if we do see see what is York so you're
the row what is your payoff six so we
can just say six times for ninth what's
the payoff if I check if you chickened
out an idea 22 and what's the payoff if
you dare and I chicken out seven and
what's the payoff if we both dear 00 so
we add all that up multiply these
numbers add them and what do we end up
with you asking me yeah you're the one
who can do arithmetic you're right it's
four and two thirds really yeah
just did that by keeping the denominator
the same so that's 24 plus 4 which is 28
plus 14 right mm-hmm just 42 plus 0 42
over 9 is 4 and two thirds this is
actually pretty cool and the payoff is 4
and two thirds on average for you and by
symmetry it's actually four and two
thirds which I like better than both of
us chickening out right both are you
chickening out is no no sorry sorry no
that's better I like better than me
cecchini how right and then I get to
write and so actually doing this even
though occasionally we will well in the
game will both die but of course we
aren't going to die we're just going to
get zero utility because all that other
stuff doesn't really matter okay we're
going to do this this is actually pretty
good right this is pretty good payoff
okay I get that in fact for either one
of us if we get in the short end of the
stick for the CD DC this is actually
better for us that's true the worst of
us are sorry not the worst of us that
doesn't sound right at all but the least
fortunate of us is much happier with
this outcome then the CD all right and
by the way we're actually happy with
this outcome than if we had uniformly
randomly chosen between them and we're
better off with this outcome then if we
had done CD and then like split the
winnings which would be four and a half
yes the same thing is doing half and I
have rights for an half four and a half
is less than four two thirds all right
those are in fact the same thing in this
case got it this is why it's something
like a third and not something like a
half so that's pretty cool so this seems
like a pretty good wind I'm going to
claim that we can do better hmm
okay okay so let's remember this 4 and
two thirds and keep it around for a
little while and let me try to convince
you that we're going to do better okay
okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
