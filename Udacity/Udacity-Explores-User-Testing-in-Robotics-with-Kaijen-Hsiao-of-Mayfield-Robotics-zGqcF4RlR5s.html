actually phase zero I would say with
need finding when we go out to people's
homes and we interview them about what
their lives are like and what they do in
their daily routine and to try to see
where a hora bot would fit in and what
useful functions the robot could do for
them and what they would want the robot
to do and initially so that's where we
came up with concepts with home security
the idea of peace of mind checking in on
your home making sure things are okay
making sure no one's breaking in and
when we took that concept out to users
then we heard a lot of things like oh
well it's Kerry going to talk to my
outdoor cameras because by the time
someone comes into the home it's kind of
too late isn't it and also we heard a
lot more of well what does Kerry do when
I'm at home and initially we said things
like well curry will sit quietly on his
charger and wait for you to go away
again so that you can use him and they
would ask but what does he do when I'm
at home and it became obvious that
people were really expecting him to be
entertaining when he was when they
they're at home with the robot in person
and also to do things that they can show
off to their friends and to be useful
and it's entertaining so we we shifted
away from home security and towards more
companion robot more entertainment robot
and in terms of testing how we did that
is so after need finding and you have
initial concepts of what the robot can
do you don't even have any prototypes
built yet at that point you can make
sketches so you make storyboards of the
features you think the robot should do
and those and if you have initial
prototypes of any sort so what we had at
that time is we had storyboards and then
we had functional prototypes that could
just drive around navigate around the
home and show in an app that you could
see through the robots camera and talk
the robots microphones and hear through
the road speakers and that was basically
it that's all that we had and we would
take that out to users in terms of
storyboards you can in person talk to
them and interviews but you can also
just have those be surveys online to get
larger numbers of people and ask people
what do you think of these features do
you want a robot to do this in your home
how much would you pay for a robot doing
this in your home and you get a lot of
feedback that way in an early fashion
that enables you to quickly change
direction if whatever direction you
picked is actually not a very compelling
once users and later on when we had
better prototypes that did more things
and
so you can take those prototypes out
even before you have if you have
industrial design so we had industrial
design for a robot but that wasn't the
functional robot and the industrial
design weren't all in one robot yet so
we would take phone models of the
industrial design and we would take more
functional robots with the app and you
would say imagine the robot looks like
this now drive us around and there would
be a robot that didn't look anything
like that driving around the house and
they could see things like oh well what
does he sound like and when he goes over
thresholds what does that like is that
okay and so we got feedback on that
phase for things like oh the robot is
way way too loud he has to be much
quieter is it going to be that loud
that's that's really annoying I wouldn't
want that in my house and that sort of
thing is really important too and then
later on of course once you have robots
that are looks like works like so we
have prototypes like that that we used
to show off a lot now and those you can
put in users homes and actually just
have them go through various functions
that you've added and stay in the home
for longer and longer periods of time
the latest tests that we've just done is
what we call drop off tests where you
put the robot in the box and you pretend
like it's a new customer and the
customers just got in the box and you're
not there at all and so they have to go
through the unboxing and onboarding
procedure to actually go through figure
out can they use the robot can they on
board the robot can the robot map their
home can the robot do the functions he's
supposed to do is that compelling to
them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
