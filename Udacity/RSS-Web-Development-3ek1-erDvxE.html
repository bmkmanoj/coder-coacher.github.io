quickly is RSS you've probably heard of
RSS before it's how you read a website
that has you know daily content you know
like a blog or a news site and you may
have a reader that's specialized for
just reading the content RSS stands for
RDF site summary and already f stands
for resource description framework now
I'm not going to quiz you on this RDF is
it's an XML format for describing just
about anything for basically
representing knowledge in XML actually
my first job I dealt with a lot of RDF
so I don't want to spend any more time
on it more commonly RSS actually refers
to Really Simple Syndication and that's
kind of more of the context of how we're
going to be dealing with it you know RDF
was kind of conceived to solve these
grand data you know organize the world's
information problems and RSS was you
know you it uses already F but really
it's just a list of a list of content
and XML so let me show you some one
example of this in the wild I'm at the
New York Times home page right now and
if we go down to the bottom of this page
we'll see a link for RSS so I'll click
that link and I'll choose the New York
Times Global homepage now you can see in
our URL we have global home XML and so
we've received an XML document and most
browsers will actually display XML in a
nice way so this is an XML document
actually an RSS and so what this
basically means is there's this a
particular namespace kind of a tag space
if you will for the items in this list
you know just like HTML has you know
opens with an HTML and has a body and
you know very specific tags and RSS
document will also have specific tags
and in XML you can use this header area
to describe what namespace from use so
we're using the the atom namespace and
the RSS 2.0 namespace and that's
basically what this is telling our
parser is you can download a kind of
descriptions of these tags from these
URLs and then we know what tags to
expect we're not going to I'm not going
to quiz you on what RSS actually is so
if we take a little peek at this
document you can see it starts out with
some header stuff
kind of in this channel section and then
we get down to this list of items and so
I'm going to collapse these first few
and we can see we've got an item and
this is basically just a list of stories
that are in New York Times so I can
collects an item and we see there's
another item there's actually a whole
bunch of items and each item has you
know title and a link and sorts of
things that you know what power an RSS
reader you know a little description you
know this is this is neat this is for an
RSS reader or a program to download the
contents of the New York Times without
having to parse all the HTML which
brings us to our next quiz</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
