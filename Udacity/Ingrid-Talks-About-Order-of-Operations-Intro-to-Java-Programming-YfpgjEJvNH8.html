operations that was something that I
never really thought twice of especially
you know when you're a kid you read the
math classes and then you're in high
school and college and you're told but
there's different order of operations
but when you're programming it's it's a
little bit different because then you've
got you know doubles and in sand floats
and that's something that like off the
bat like I kind of struggled with like
sometimes my like I would run my code
and it worked other times it didn't work
and i ended up learning that one of the
most important things is being able to
know the answer before it comes out and
understanding how that answer works and
understanding that sequence like the
operations like what what different
things would work and what wouldn't work
and one of the things for me like you
know even just sitting down with a piece
of paper and understanding ok so if i
divide by an int well i get an int back
like if it's a double that i was
dividing by like what what's the actual
way to do this that's right and then if
something wasn't right i really needed
to work hard to understand why at first
and now I mean it's more instinctive
that I like I'll even write it not
thinking twice about it but when you're
learning this it's something that like
you don't realize is actually important
to keep things I guess together and
concise is a big thing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
