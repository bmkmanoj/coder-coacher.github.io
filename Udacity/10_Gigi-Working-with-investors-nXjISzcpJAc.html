should work with investors that
basically is broken down between the for
investment and after investment right
it's two separate stages however there
are some common so common thing that
entrepreneurs should always keep in mind
and the first thing to keep in mind that
cross the entire process and the entire
life's lifecycle is that the honesty
transparency and openness are probably
your best towards an entrepreneur to
keep a good relationship with your with
your investor at the end of the day the
investor does not sit in the company
every day and the thing that are really
trivial and really apparent for you as
you know two years and as an
entrepreneur are not that clear to the
investor that meets you every few weeks
or every month or every few months and
so when you do not update your invest
when you're not open when you're not
transparent it's very easy to lose the
trust it's very easy to get to the point
where the investor feels that
something's been hidden that it's not
been you know it's not been fully shared
and this is really bad and that's bad
from the beginning from when you want to
start creating their relationship all
the way up till to the exit of the
company and you've got to understand
that their relationship with the
investor is a long-term relationship the
average entrepreneur is going to either
fail within an average of twenty four
months 18 to 24 month or succeed which
is going to take an average of four to
five years and so this is a long-term
journey and if you're going to be with
somebody engaged for four to five years
you know this mostly more in the most
relationship in the world right if
you're going to beat that if you're
going to be successful at doing that you
really have to think how you're building
a trust-based relationship which is
based not just on liking each other
because you know over time you may not
necessarily become great friends but you
need to maintain that relationship that
the first thing is transparency and
openness I think that when you come is
in the preneur to an investor you need
to think what are the things that the
investor would really want to see and
and what do you doesn't want to see the
investor what's your character do you
need to bring out your character and who
you are the next thing that the investor
want to see is that you're serious and
being serious meaning treating treating
yourself seriously treating the investor
seriously treat the investors time
seriously coming prepared answering
questions properly one of the thing i do
is that when somebody sends me a
presentation over email before i meet
them
there's like a very tenacious process of
back and forth questions that I would
send it could it could come to like you
know 40 emails going back and forth
because what i want to see is not
necessarily the answers they give me but
i want to see the seriousness in which
they're taking this so you know I asked
him questions I want to see that they
come back with a reasonable answer I
would see how long it takes so if
someone I'll give an example two weeks
ago somebody wrote me an email I told
them you know I would love to see the
market map of this thing and they told
me okay sure it's going to take us two
weeks when I got back to them and said
why is it going to take two weeks and
are you busy with something else is this
something that I'm missing and I said
well you know we're doing lots of things
and then you think yourself if it's
going to take them two weeks to create a
market map the clear they should have
had before but if it's going to take
them out two weeks to update it or
create it then what's going to happen
when the customer is going to tell them
I need something now and what's going to
happen if they're going to launch
something and consumers are going to
basically tell them by their behavior
did that's not what they want is it also
going to take them two weeks to start
moving and so that was a very short
discussion right and so through these
questions and answers I learned not
necessarily about the business itself
although a bit of that as well but
mostly about the character of the
intrapreneurs you know and and I'm
trying to see whether they're the kind
of people that I want to invest in and
the people I want to invest in our these
stars they're the people that are you
know they have fire in their eyes they
love what they do they wake up in the
morning and they want to conquer the
world and the speed in which are moving
and speed is the most important thing
for an intrapreneur the speed in which
they're moving is appropriate for the
market challenges that are going to
tackle and people think that speed is
only for Internet companies rewrap
companies but it's not true if you want
to start a medical devices company the
speed may be different in terms you're
not gonna have a nap out in three month
but if you're not going to move fast
somebody else is going to eat your lunch
and so you know this process is
something that that tells me about
entrepreneurs and I think that
entrepreneurs need to think very
carefully about how they present
themselves and already they come and how
fast they can move in the interaction
with the investor if they really want to
get the money and you know on the speed
side my partner James likes giving what
I think is the best analogy for speed
which I think their printers would enjoy
and that is that when you're when you're
playing chess against the grandmaster
then you don't send a chance right there
you know they're geniuses and but even I
did play pretty average as if you let me
do take two moves for every move of the
master I'm going to win because death
does the way it is and when you're when
you're a young company the only thing
you have as your weapons against the
large corporates is your speed they have
more people they have more energy they
have more money they have they can
market harder they can do whatever they
want but they're moving slow and so as a
start-up if you do not move at least
twice as fast as the large corporates
you're not going to win and so you know
that's what interpreters need to be
ready in general for and that's what I'm
looking for and that's what they need to
be able to present to investors because
all the smart investors more than
anything else they will look at
character and speed these are the two
things</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
