mobile constraints that we can't violate
when we're building and designing mobile
applications or our users are gonna have
a really bad time let's deep dive into
these four yeah we'll talk about what
happens when you actually do get them
wrong and what the implications are to
your user in your app so let's get
started with a quiz so we have an
application here on the screen and as
you can see a user is using this media
player application to actually play a
video so you can see a couple of things
it's on a 3G network the power is about
half its 3:20 p.m. I guess the
application is in landscape mode and
they've played about halfway through the
video we can also see that the app has
defaulted a 1080p resolution to play
this video so there is a UX fail
happening here I want you to think about
which one of these elements that I've
highlighted are contributing to this
fail and select it on the screen</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
