to ensure that BGP routing messages sent
between routers between a esas are
authentic now this turns out to be a
little bit easier than it might appear
because the session between these
routers is a TCP session therefore all
we have to do is authenticate this
session the way that this is done in
practice is done using TCP s md5 on
occasion option in such a setup every
message exchange on the TCP connection
not only contains the message but also a
hash of the message with a shared secret
key now this key distribution is manual
the operator in a s1 and the operator
and a s2 must agree on what that key is
and typically they do that out-of-band
for example by calling each other on the
phone but by calling each other on the
phone and manually setting that key in
the router configuration but once that
key is set all messages between this
pair of routers is authenticated another
way to guarantee session authentication
is to have a s1 transmitted packets with
the TTL of 255 and have the receiving a
s drop any packet that has a TTL less
than 250 for because most ebgp sessions
are only a single hop and attackers are
typically remote it is not possible for
the recipient a s to accept a packet
from a remote attacker because likely
that attackers packets will have a TTL
value of less than 250 for this defense
is aptly called the TTL hack defense for
bgp session authentication</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
