nice assertion violation messages and
bug disambiguation can be trickier when
all we have is something like a cordon
or a stack trace and so what these
things are going to give is at least if
we have good debugging symbols for
probably some sort of an indication of
what part of the code failed and it's
going to give an indication of the stack
frames leading up to the failure and so
sometimes these are going to be useful
for doing disambiguation and sometimes
not they're provide kind of
qualitatively at some level similar
information to assertion violation
messages and if they're giving us some
clues relating the symptom to the source
code but it's not going to be as easy to
find and it's not going to be as
readable now third weapon we have in the
arsenal I'm doing bug triage it's
actually pretty interesting which is
that we can do a search over the
revision history of the software under
test that is to say of course if we have
access to the revision control system we
can do this so let's go back to our
example here we have all these bugs and
so if it's the case that all of these
bugs here appear just one revision back
and these other ones appeared in
different revisions maybe weeks or
months ago then it's a good bet that all
of these new inputs are triggering the
same error that is to say an error that
somebody just committed the other day
and these probably trigger older bugs so
this is a pretty powerful weapon and
some automated tools for revision
control even building functionality to
this search over version history so for
example get has a git bisect command
that can be used to do a binary search
over version history in an automated way
and even if that kind of thing isn't
available it's not too hard to script
this up yourself given an automated way
to detect it for particular version has
a particular bug our last way we can
triage bugs is to examine the test case
and often it's the case that test cases
that trigger the same bugs have similar
features so in the compiler bug finding
example that I've been using it's often
the case that I'll look at a bunch of
failure triggering programs that is to
say inputs to the compiler that caused
it to crash or otherwise fail and ball
contains some sort of a smoking gun like
maybe 64-bit integer divides or
something like that so it'll be some
sort of common feature that tips us off
that some collection of test inputs all
maps to the same bug then if we see
another group of test inputs that
contain some totally different feature
so maybe really deeply nested
parentheses or really long identifiers
it's a good bet that those map to a
different bug now the problem is looking
over large randomly generated test cases
is really painful and so this is going
to directly lead to our next topic which
is a really important one which is test
case reduction or test case minimization
and that's an automated process for
taking a large failure inducing input
and turning it into a small one and
we're going to cover that next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
