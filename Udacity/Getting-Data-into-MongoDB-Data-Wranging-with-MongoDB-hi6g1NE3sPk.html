our data we're at a place where we need
to get the data into MongoDB so we've
looked at queries to MongoDB and you've
done some exercises let's look at
inserting documents into collections now
the database we've been working with all
along has been the examples database and
we've looked at a couple of different
collections here we've looked at the
Otto's collection we've also done some
queries against a city's collection now
this script that we're looking at here
is actually the script that I wrote to
clean the automobiles data the way I
originally wrote this was that it would
simply output JSON documents that I
could then import into MongoDB and
that's actually the strategy that I
would recommend but I think it's also
important for you to have an
understanding of inserting documents
into MongoDB and so we'll take this
opportunity to show you a little bit
about how to do that now there's a lot
about the insert statement that I'm not
going to cover right here but this is
the simplest form of using insert now
what we're going to do is simply loop
through all of the autos that I've
created up here in the code where I've
cleaned the data and essentially created
a dictionary for each auto that needs to
be inserted into a MongoDB collection
then we're going to simply loop through
the list of those autos that I've
created and call the insert statement
for each one of them passing it a Python
dictionary PI Mongo
well translate this into Abby's on
encoding and send it across to the
database now what I've got here is I've
just got a couple of print statements
one that's going to demonstrate how many
autos there are before we do this series
of inserts and one that's going to show
how many there are after now to do this
I'm using a command we haven't looked at
before but I'm sure you can figure out
what it does simply tells us how many
documents were returned for this fine
command
okay now let's run this okay so what
happened was we went ahead and inserted
all of those documents that we had
parsed out of the CSV file from DB PDF
for autos then what I did was check the
collection this my autos collection
before I did the inserts and got a count
of how many were in it there were none
after doing all my inserts I have close
to 7800 docum
in this my autos collection now so again
this is an example of the insert command
in MongoDB one way of getting documents
into the database</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
