rolls a six-sided dice and returns a
value for that roll between 1 and 6 we
know that it will return one of these
whole numbers which are integers so
let's start by writing our function
definition with a return type of int and
name our function roll dice and this
return type means that we expect a
return statement in our function that
returns an int as output now let's start
writing the code to generate this random
int between 1 and 6 we can use math dot
random to generate a decimal number that
falls between 0 and 1 not including 1
exactly but how do we get this value to
be an integer between 1 and 6 well we
know how to create a number between 0
and nine point nine nine nine from
before by multiplying this random number
by 10 so let's use a similar strategy to
change this range to be between 1 and 6
let's first focus on our total range
when we wanted to create a range that
had 10 total numbers in it 0 through 9
remember to count 0 as an option 2 we
multiplied a random number by 10 so 10
numbers multiplied by 10 this time we'll
want a range that has 6 numbers in it 1
through 6 so we'll want to multiply by 6
to get this correct range so let's
multiply a random number by 6 then the
random number here will be between 0 and
nearly 6 but that's not quite what we
wanted because now we've just expanded
our range from 0 to almost 1 to 0 to
almost 6 and we want the minimum value
of our range to be 1 not 0 and we want
our highest value to be nearly 7 not
nearly 6 so that later when we cast this
value to an int a maximum value close to
7 something like six point nine nine
nine will be cast to a max integer value
of six so we'll need to shift this whole
range up by one we can do that by adding
1 to our random number and our adding 1
shifts this range into the correct place
1 through almost 7 the next thing we
need to do is our casting step to get
the random integer we want without any
decimal place
you and we can cast this number by
putting the variable type we want which
is an int in parentheses right before
the value we want to change random
number and let's assign this value to a
variable random int and again even if
the double random number value is close
to seven something like six point nine
nine eight when this is cast to an int
it will turn into six because the
decimal portion is ignored entirely so
now we have our correct range one
through six all integers and to return
this value there's one more step our
return statement
and for that we actually say return and
then the value you want to return in
this case our variable random int great
now we have a return type and a return
statement and we can call this function
and get a random int as output so we
wrote a function definition for roll
dice now let's call it twice and store
the output the output should be a
randomly generated integer that's
between one and six so let's store these
as int variables roll one and roll two
let's also include printing code that
will print out the value of roll one and
roll two and the print output might look
something like this
your first rule will be a 2 and the
second roll is a 5 so even though these
two rolls were assigned to the same
function call each time we call this
function a new random integer between 1
and 6 will be generated and that's why
these have different roll values and if
we ran this code again new random values
will be generated so good job we've
finished writing a program that can
simulate rolling dice</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
