for you to practice creating scatter
plots and to make sure that you knew how
to work with our new data frame will use
our ggplot function to get our histogram
and we'll pass it the two variables that
we had in our data frame age and front
count mean and for the data variable I
want to pass it PFF see by age instead
of PF since this is the new data frame
we're working with writing this code I
see that I get an error and that's
because i forgot my g ohm i needed add
GM point so adding that is another layer
I can run my code and get the result now
we can do slightly better than this plot
let's connect our dots in order of age
by using geo mine instead of genome
point this plot immediately makes clear
the patterns we mentioned before as well
as the oddness at age 69 we see that
with the older ages our estimates are
highly variable for friend count mean
they're jumping up and down sort of all
over the place and for our young users
they still have high friend counts and
for the users between age 30 and 60 that
mean friend count is hovering just about
over a hundred</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
