bit tricky we want to know in
double-stranded DNA the percentage of
wanting can never be more than what well
we know that guanine must equal cytosine
and that Adnan must equal thymine and
double-stranded DNA well we know that
the max percentage you could have
theoretically is a hundred percent right
you can't go more than one hundred
percent but if I have a hundred percent
of guanine that must mean I have a
hundred percent of cytosine and that
can't be right because our totals got to
be a hundred percent but that would add
up to two hundred percent so we can
creep this number down until we get to
fifty percent and then we would have
fifty percent cytosine and that would
add up to be a total of a hundred
percent and we that means we'd have zero
percent of each of these but we can't
have more than fifty percent wanting
because of the limits of what it must be
paired with in this case cytosine and
double-stranded DNA</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
