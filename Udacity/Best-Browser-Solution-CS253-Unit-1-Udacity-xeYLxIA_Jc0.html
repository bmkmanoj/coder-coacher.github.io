more than just a trick question the
point I'm trying to make is that all of
these browsers are a little different
and if you've used more than one of them
you'll you'll know that that's obviously
true however none of these browsers are
perfect and in fact it's not even clear
when we're doing web development what
perfect is it's a very imperfect art web
design is and so while you may have a
preference for one of these browsers it
is not necessarily true that your users
agree you know you may like chrome and
your users may prefer internet explorer
or more realistically you may like
chrome and your users are forced to use
Internet Explorer so you need to have in
mind that all of these browsers are
different they all behave differently
and you need to keep that in mind as you
as you develop and test in as many
browsers as you can</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
