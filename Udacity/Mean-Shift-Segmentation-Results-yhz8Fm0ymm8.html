comes from this nice little database
that was published based upon this hamy
paper Comaneci was one of the original
developers a mean shift is applied to
computer vision and what you can see
here so here's our original image
alright and then you apply mean shift
and it does a really fine job alright I
mean take a look at this brick structure
here and you see all of those pixels are
put in the same region likewise you get
this front of this building here the
whole sidewalk is on one cluster with
the exception of over this area right
well that's in a dark shadow from the
tree you'll notice the whole shadow has
been put into one cluster because the
system can't at this point know that
it's a shadow alright but I think you
would agree that if you take a look at
this picture here and you were to draw
boundaries around where the different
clusters were okay you would probably
end up with an image that looked
something like that here are some more
examples of a mean shift segmentation
result and you can see it does a pretty
good job you know take a look at this
picture down here all the water is put
into one cluster there this foliage is
broken out nicely the islands etc so if
you've got the right feature space it
does a pretty good job of finding the
clusters finally I want to show you an
example it also comes from that same
original database and again it has a
nice original image here of the mountain
and on the right hand side are the
segmentation results so the good news is
you can see it does a pretty reasonable
job I mean it pulls out this section all
the section up here that didn't have the
snow on it and maybe this section here
as well but notice all the texture
that's going on in here okay well it's
not that that's wrong it's just less
clear that it's right what I mean by
that is it's not totally clear what
you're trying to do with this picture
that you're carving it up into segments
that was the original idea behind the
super pixels though the idea was let me
carve this thing up into little atomic
units that I know don't have to be
broken up again but whether I would
combine them or use them together in
some way depends
on the future processing that you have
to do so often what you'll do is a
segmentation step to create these broken
up these regions and then figure out how
to process those regions going forward
so the segmentation then in some sense
is a pre-processing step to give you a
much smaller set of units to work</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
