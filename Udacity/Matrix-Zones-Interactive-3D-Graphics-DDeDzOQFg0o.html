you'll get some sense of the lay of the
land with matrices and how they relate
to transform here's a map of the sort of
things you'll find the upper left area
of the matrix is where rotations and
scales show up if the transform changes
only this area of the matrix it's called
a linear transformation I'm not going to
spend time on the formal definition of
this term the additional course
materials include resources for more on
the underlying math the definition is
fairly basic stuff about how addition
and multiplication are preserved but
doesn't have much effect on how we
actually do computer graphics the upper
right is where the translations
accumulate these translation values will
get affected by multiplication with
other matrices of course translations
only affect points since vectors have 0
for their fourth coordinate 3j s
provides a function called decomposed to
extract the translation rotation and
scale components from a matrix the
translation and scale factors come back
as vectors as you might expect the
rotation comes back as a quaternion
something we'll talk about when we get
to animation the short version is that a
quaternion is a compact way to store the
axis and angle of rotation for a
rotation matrix one useful property
quaternions have is that you can easily
interpolate between them which is useful
for interpolating between two different
orientations notice that the bottom row
is always 0 0 0 1 the transforms we
cover here are called affine transforms
parallel lines stay parallel when an
affine transform is applied in modeling
you'll essentially always use a fine
transforms so we never change this last
row since GPUs are tuned to use 4 by 4
matrices most of us just use 4 x 4's
everywhere for simplicity sake when we
discuss perspective cameras will set the
values in this last row will then be
using a projective transform with a fine
transforms when appoints coordinates are
multiplied by the matrix the fourth
coordinate starts out as one and ends up
as one this last row in a projection
matrix modifies that fourth coordinate
to be something other than one what that
means is something we'll leave until a
later lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
