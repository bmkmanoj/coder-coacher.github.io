the marketing industry right now it's
all about growing your business quickly
last lesson we spoke about a few
examples do things that don't scale in
the beginning you may want to pass out
postcards or door hangers but that's not
something you're going to want to do
when you have a million users referral
bonuses have helped many companies
achieve success people gave ten bucks to
new customers and ten bucks to the
people who referred them suggesting
followers or people who shared the app
with is another way to gain users with
Twitter they suggested people to follow
their members because they knew that if
people were following and being followed
they were more likely to be active but
let's take a moment to explore a few
more take YouTube for example when they
were first starting out they utilized
giveaways and contests to attract new
users to create accounts and upload
videos they're giving away an iPod Nano
a day remember this as we talked about
previously in the course they also use
partnerships to help accelerate their
business like the one that they did with
MySpace now over on the other hand did
some in-person growth hacking they
teamed up with Google Ventures and drove
around entrepreneurs and investors for
free giving entrepreneurs 15 minutes to
pitch investors an idea during the ride
this was a great way to get future
influencers talking about their service
and caring about it now imagine if Mark
Zuckerberg and every interview he did
told people that he got his start in the
back seat of his Oberer rather than in a
dorm room we were also teamed up with a
northern California blow-dry bar where
you get your hair shampooed and the
blow-dry they offered free rides to all
of their clients that booked a blowout
this allowed them to one get press into
access another niche market and finally
Foursquare lets you leverage other
platforms for example you can post
check-ins to your facebook timeline for
other potential users to see because
growth hacking is so popular these days
we can't cover everything in this course
however we've posted links to articles
if you're interested in learning more
and reading more examples of growth
hacking thinking about a small brand or
a small startup it's really important to
embrace grassroots tactics think
constant
think things like giveaways and contests
anything that can move the needle in the
right direction and help build your
social media followers ace it's also
important to consider things like
user-generated content getting great
content from your users quotes anything
tactical like that can really pay off
and help engage with your customer base</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
