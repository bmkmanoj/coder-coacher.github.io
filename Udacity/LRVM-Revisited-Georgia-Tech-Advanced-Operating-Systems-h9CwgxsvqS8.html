what it does so there's a time axis the
application when it calls the begin
transaction primitive of lr vm what lr
vm does is it says ok the application is
going to modify some portion of the
memory so let me create a memory copy of
the old contents of the portion of the
memory that this transaction is going to
modify and that's what is called the
in-memory undo record of lr vm in the
body of the transaction the program is
doing normal program rights and they are
going into the memory no problem with
that because l r vm has the undo record
already stashed away so all of these are
rights to normal memory and there is no
interaction with lr vm during this
portion of the transaction code then the
application reaches the end transaction
makes the end transaction call to lr vm
at that point lr vm is going to write a
redo record onto the disk when the
transaction commits because n
transaction is synonymous with
committing so far as lr vm is concerned
and therefore at this point the changes
that have been made to virtual memory
are written out as a redo log record and
forced to the disk by lr vm we know disk
i/o is slow and the more you do it the
slower will be the subsystem that is
using these lr vm primitives and that's
why L r vm provides the no flush option
in n transaction call which allows an
application to tell lr vm write it out
to the disk but don't stop me from
progressing further in my computation in
other words the application is hoping
that there won't be any failures that
will result in all the changes that is
recorded in memory not being forced to
the disk so lr vm is going to write out
the redo log as a background activity
and the hope is that there won't be any
system crash during the time that it
takes for it to do and this is what we
called as the window wasn't
ability when we talked about lr vm so
what the no flush option does is to
increase the vulnerability of the system
to power failures in favor of
performance and that's a calculated risk
and application developer is taking if
they specify no flush optimization in
the end transaction so on the other hand
if your conservative then what you would
do is you let the end transaction have
the normal transactional semantics which
is to say that add in transaction force
the right of the log in to the disk to
ensure that the log segment has been
committed to the disk and only then
allow the application to proceed further
and at this point at the commit point
the other thing that lr vm would do is
in addition to forcing the log record to
the disk it'll also get rid of the undo
record because undo record is no longer
needed for this transaction since the
transaction is successfully committed
and we know as a background activity
what lr vm does is to update the
original data segments with the changes
that have been recorded in the redo logs
because as I recall the data segment
contains a persistent data which have
been brought into memory and modified
during this transaction and those
changes had to be eventually persisted
right now they're sitting in the redo
log records and what the log truncation
part of the L RVM library does is to
read the redo log records and apply them
to the data segment and get rid of the
redo logs so this is the log truncation
or cleanup of the disk space that is
done periodically by lr vm because in
the absence of crashes you have to make
sure that you clean up the disk every
once in a while so the upshot of lr vm
implementation is there are three copies
of the vm space done by lr vm to manage
persistence for recoverable objects of
course it optimizes log force by
delaying them at transaction endpoint
but in implementing lr vm one of the
biggest source of vulnerability is power
failure because if you in fact use that
optimization to defer writing out
log record to the permanent storage then
all the work that you did in this
transaction may actually be wasted if in
fact there is a power failure before
this log force happens now what does
providing a battery backed DRAM give you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
