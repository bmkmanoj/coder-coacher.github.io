a good understanding of what the
original function proc does so let's
take the two cases that really embody
the output of this function there are
two inputs but the output only depends
on the value of a specifically the value
of the function test on a if test a is
true then we return the second parameter
B if test a is false we turn the first
parameter a that's what we need to check
in each of these functions so let's
start looking at them in proc one if
test X which is the first parameter is
true we return why this matches with the
original function if test of the first
parameter is true we return the second
as we do in proc one if test of the
first parameter is false we return that
parameter X so test X is false which is
equivalent to test a is false and in
both cases we return a and X which are
just different names for the same
variable in this function so this is
equivalent let's look at the second
function proc to notice here that this
condition is based on the value of B we
know this can't possibly be equivalent
to proc our original function because
the output here is not dependent on the
value of B so we can tell right away
that this is false this is not
equivalent to original function let's
look at prox 3 the structure here is a
little different but let's work our way
through it by going through both of the
examples in the event the test day is
true we reset result to be and we turn
we return result so as our original
function did if test day is true we
return b if test day is false we simply
return result which was set at the
beginning to a so the overall
functionality is that if a test day is
true we return a this matches with
original function definition so this is
equivalent to proc now we have the last
function proc for in my throw you off
that you see you dasa t in quotes here
which is not present in any other
function but it's important we work our
way through the problem if test day is
true then not test day is false so we
return b so if test day is true we
return b that matches with the original
definition if test day is
not test day is true so we set B to
Udacity but then we return a if test day
is false we change the value of B but we
don't do anything with it we just
returned a so the result is the same as
their original function proc</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
