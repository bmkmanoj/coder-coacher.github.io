incremental concept learning and david
has created a visual illustration of
this algorithm we're given an example
and we're also told but it is a positive
example or a negative example if this is
a positive example then the algorithm
comes to the left branch of this
particular tree and it asks does the
current definition of the concept cover
this positive example we want to cover
positive examples if it already covers
the positive example we don't have to do
anything we don't agree revise your
current definition of the concept on the
other hand if the current definition of
the concept does not cover the positive
example then we must revise it in some
way so that it does so we'll generalize
it on the other half of the tree of this
example is not a positive instance of
the example then we can ask ourselves
does the current definition of the
concept cover it if it doesn't cover it
it shouldn't cover it and if it doesn't
cover it then we don't have to do
anything on the other hand if the
example is negative instance and the
current definition does cover it then we
want to refine our current definition to
rule it out so we'll specialize our
current definition so oftentimes we see
children committing over generalization
or over specialization so to take an
example of this we can imagine a child
that has a concept of a cat that a cat
has to be black the child has only ever
been around black cats so part of their
definition part of their concept of a
cat is a cats are black then she goes
over to her friend's house as introduced
to her friends cat and her friend's cat
is orange right now she's told that this
is an example of a cat but it does not
fit her current definition of a cat so
she needs to generalize her definition
that cats can be different colors
similarly we can imagine another child
that has only ever been exposed to dogs
thus the child's concept of a dog is
that a dog is anything that is furry has
four legs and that we keep as a pet
this child goes over to the same
friend's house and is introduced to this
orange cat and right now that orange cat
fits his definition of a dog it's furry
has four legs and they keep it as a pet
but he's told that this cat is not a dog
so he needs to specialize his concept of
a dog to exclude
this cat that's good David it connects
things with our everyday lives</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
