conveyance to illustrate how these
different words get assigned to
different categories different slots in
this frame now we know that car was a
conveyance because of the role that is
preposition by place here that is an
intelligence agent might make use of the
structure the sentence to make sense of
the story we have designed human
language in such a way that there is a
particular structure to them
prepositions for instance play a very
important role here are some of the
common propositions by far from two with
each preposition plays certain thematic
roles by can be in by an agent or by a
conveyance or by a location similarly
for the other propositions so the moment
we see by here we know that whatever is
going to come off to buy the car can be
an agent or a conveyance or a location
note again that the categories we are
using here a semantic categories we are
not saying noun or verb anything like
that what we are saying here is
beneficiary and duration and source
which are semantic categories that allow
us to draw inferences but how did we
know the car was a conveyance and not an
agent or a location in general while the
structure of language does provide
constraints this constraints do not
always definitely determine the meaning
of that particular word we'll use
additional knowledge to find the exact
meaning of the word car</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
