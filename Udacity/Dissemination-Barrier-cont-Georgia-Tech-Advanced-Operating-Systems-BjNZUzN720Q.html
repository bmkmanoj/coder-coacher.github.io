happening in an every rod well its order
of n communication events per every Ron
because every processor is sending a
message to another processor in in every
round and therefore the amount of
communication that's happening is order
of n where n is the number of processors
that are participating in this barrier
so now you can quickly see what's going
to happen in the next round and the next
round K is going to be equal to 1 and
therefore I'm going to choose each
processor is going to choose a neighbor
to send the message to based on this
formula that I that I have here so in
round 0 for instance what we did was p0
was sending a message to a neighbor that
is one distant from it because K was 0
and now in round one K is 1 and
therefore p0 is going to be sending a
message to a neighbor that is too
distant from it so p0 is sent to p2 and
similarly P 1 2 distant from it P 3 P 2
- distant p4 before - distant from it in
cyclic order is going to be P 1 so it is
sending sending a message to P 1 so
that's the round 1 of communication with
k equal 1 round 1 of communication where
once again order of n messages are being
exchanged among these processors to
indicate that this round is complete
just as I said about round 0 every
processor will know that this round is
complete when it receives a message from
its ordained neighbor so in this case P
2 is going to expect to receive a
message from p0 and it has also sent its
message to p4 its
all-day neighbor to which it is supposed
to send a message in this round once it
is done P 2 knows that round one is over
and it can progress to the next round so
the independent decision is being made
by each one of these processes in terms
of knowing that this particular round is
over and they can progress to the next
round of the dissemination barrier and
just as I mentioned in the previous
round
all of these communications happen in
parallel so if the interconnection
network has a redundant parallel paths
these paddle and parallel paths can be
exploited by the dissemination barrier
in order to do this communication very
effectively so in the next round a
meaning round number 2 K is equal to 2
and therefore what we're going to do is
every one of these processors is going
to be choosing a neighbor that is for
distant from itself so in other words p0
is gonna send a message to its neighbor
that is for distant that is P for P one
is going to send it to for distant which
means if you wrap it around it's gonna
be p0 and so on so this is the
communication that's happening in round
2 where every processor is sending a
message to its neighbor who is four
distant because k equal to 2 for distant
from itself so just sort of belaboring
the point the gossip in round 2 is over
so far as P 3 is concerned when it has
received a gossip message from its four
distant neighbor which happens to be P
four and it has also sent a message to
its four distant neighbor P 2 in this
case at this point every one of these
processors knows that round 2 of gossip
is complete and similar to what I've
been emphasizing all along parallel
communication pads and the
interconnection network can be fully
exploited by the dissemination barrier
