working hard around cardiac arrest
survival training people in CPR in our
community and putting AED s in the
community but I was out to lunch one day
heard a siren in the distance and it
grew louder and ended up pulling right
in front of a deli where I was eating
that's when I learned that somebody
right next door had suffered a cardiac
arrest and I wasn't aware of it until
that ambulance got there that event made
me realize that even though somebody's
trained they're not always in the exact
right place at the exact right time and
maybe we could bring technology and
where firefighters are alerted with
radios maybe we could use people's cell
phones who were trained in CPR even our
off-duty professionals and make them
aware of events that they were close to
but couldn't see we're crowdsourcing
good Samaritans that's really the
purpose of the PulsePoint app the
solution that we have only can exist
with the mobile app where you have push
notifications you have location-based
services you have people carrying phones
that have the sophistication to do this
we have an entirely volunteer
development team so Android being so
widely adopted it's a platform when we
put our development time into that we
know it's going to get into the hands of
a lot of users as a fire chief I didn't
have apt developers no programmers on my
staff but we understood the problem very
well so we ended up turning to a
university in kayuu Northern Kentucky
University who had an app development
school and we brought out a number of
interns and set them up here in the Bay
Area and prototype using interns once we
proved the concept that's when we turned
to Dave Duffield and workday and they
sort of helped take the concept and make
it real when you first load the
application it shows you all the
emergencies that are happening around
you not just cardiac arrests but if you
want to be notified of cardiac arrest
you just go into the settings screen and
you select the CPR notification once
you've done that if a cardiac arrest
occurs within walking distance of you
you'll be notified and you'll receive a
map and it'll show you where you are
where the patients located
and any nearby public access
defibrillators the app also provides CPR
instructions so reminders and also a
metronome that can help you set the
proper cadence of your chest
compressions you can't solve this
upfront on a whiteboard it's a constant
iteration learning from your users
getting experienced in the field and you
have to be in the game you have to
actually be solving the problem to be
able to learn enough to make a
difference we had somebody playing
soccer at a local school collapsed with
cardiac arrest 911 is called and we have
an EMT who's home with his family lives
across the street from the school gets
notified just runs across the street to
do CPR and event he would have not been
aware of but very very close by and save
the gentleman's life so it's actually
seeing the app save lives those are
where you say we really made a
difference in these people's lives and
we have so much potential to do it again
and again and again</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
