the if-statement that I want to briefly
talk about so you know now that the if
statement makes a decision you go one
way or another depending on some
condition now sometimes your code is
arranged so that you don't actually have
a decision to do one thing or another
but the decision is between one thing
and nothing at all
for example over here I've rearranged
the code for computing the actual floor
of it I'm initializing actual flow with
the floor and then I only need to adjust
it if the floor is greater than 13 and
otherwise I need to do nothing at all in
this case it is proof ly legal to omit
the else part that's like if you only
choose between doing something or just
staying in place it's okay to do more
than one thing you could put other
actions inside here maybe a print
statement generally in more complicated
situations there's going to be several
statements in between the braces
conversely if there is only one action
here it's legal to omit the braces but
we won't ever do that it's just clear to
always put them there makes the code
easier to read now go ahead and work out
a couple more practice problems with
Sara and then we'll talk more about how
these conditions are formed</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
