component then the information loss is
going to be something like the sum of
all of these distances that I'm drawing
in here the distance between the points
and their new projected spots on the new
feature on the line and we can sum this
up over all the points will get some
number and here's the key insight
let me draw in another principal
component that we could have
hypothesized as the first principal
component is the one we wanted to use
let's suppose it instead of the red line
we were looking at this purple line
instead then we can ask the same
question of the purple line what's the
information loss when we project all of
the points down on to it and we'll start
to get something that looks like this
and it's a little bit cluttered but I
hope what you can see is that on average
these purple lines are all going to be
significantly longer than the red lines
for any given point that might not be
true but for the points in aggregate it
will be true then when we maximize the
variance we're actually minimizing the
distance between the points and their
new spot on the line in other words it's
a mathematical fact
that when we do this projection onto the
direction of maximal variance and only
onto that direction
we'll be minimizing the distance from
the old point to the new transformed
point and what this is necessarily doing
is minimizing the information loss</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
