that really pervade the course that
we've seen over and over again but I
haven't mentioned them explicitly until
now and these are themes that aren't
just pervasive throughout this course
but are pervasive throughout all
computer science
the first one is abstraction and
abstraction is all about hiding details
the point of abstraction is to make it
so you can have one thing that is used
in many different ways and you can use
it without necessarily understanding all
the details behind it and we've seen
lots and lots of examples of abstraction
in this class the most important one is
procedural abstraction we can write one
procedure use it to do lots of different
things depending on what the inputs are
and when we use that procedure we don't
need to know exactly what sequence of
instructions we'll execute what we know
is what the procedure does the second
main theme is universality and we talked
about this early in the class about how
computers are universal machines and
want to show you how much better I've
got a drawing if you thought my drawing
of a toaster and unit one was not
recognizable I hope you can see how much
better I can do now this is a toaster
and a toaster is very different from a
computer a computer is a universal
machine and we've seen lots of examples
of how a computer is universal that we
only need a few simple constructs to be
able to define every possible program we
saw that if we had a way to make
decisions and we saw we have that with
if in Python we saw that if we have a
way to keep track of things and in
Python we can do that using variables
and data and if we have a way to keep
going and we first saw that using while
with a while loop we can make something
keep going as long as we want but in
fact we don't even need while we could
do that with procedures and that's what
we saw with recursive definitions in
unit 6 and once we have those three
things well we can write any computer
programmer so we have much more power
with a computer than we do with the
toaster the final major theme I want to
summarize as our third main theme is one
we've already mentioned here it's
recursive definitions
and we introduce those explicitly in
unit six but you saw them many times
before that the first time you saw them
was actually in unit 1 we saw these
rules that said we can make an
expression by taking another expression
using the plus operator and combining it
with another expression and that was not
enough by itself for a recursive
definition we also needed a base case
and we saw a base case like we can have
an expression that's a number so the big
idea here is that with very simple rules
we can define infinitely many things and
very complex things by using rules that
define things in terms of simpler
versions of themselves</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
