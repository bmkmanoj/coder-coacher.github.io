the templates all the different HTML I
use there and we'll be done
front that HTML this is the template for
the front of the blog I'm using some
more advanced template features again
you don't have to do this we didn't
teach it but this is how I did it and
there's something to learn from here I
think this extends based on HTML so the
template language you're using Jinja to
allows you to have this kind of template
inheritance so you'll have to write the
same HTML over and over again so I'll
show you based on HTML this has the main
structure of our document it's got our
doctype and our head with our title and
it includes the CSS I've been using to
kind of make the blog look a little
prettier and it's got the main body
which basically draws a title this is
the the main text at the top of the page
and that I've been clicking on and
there's this links to the front and then
we've got this div for our content and
inside here we can create a block and
this is what the other templates
override so all of our templates that it
extend from base HTML can use the main
kind of wrapper HTML for the actual
document so front says replace that
content and base the HTML with this
content and this is some basic Python
code inside this template which says 4p
and posts call pete render remember we
saw that function and blog that pi every
post has a render function which renders
posts HTML with that blog entry that
gets put here ginger has a syntax called
safe now normally all of the HTML
automatically escaped if I didn't have
the safe here which Jinja to would
automatically because of the way I
configured it when we set it up it would
escape everything so if I were to get
rid of this piece of code here and we
were to reload our blog it would look
something like this
a bunch of escaped HTML blog entries and
so in the escape syntax what we're
telling Jinja is we know what this HTML
is it's safe you can just include it
verbatim that makes our blog entry look
like actual rendered HTML and not this
if we were to look at the source for
this page you can see what we typed in
has all been escaped I'm using HTML
escaping which is not exactly what we
intended we can tell Jinja this is safe
you can include it verbatim and it will
render fine
so that's the front HTML this is
basically the front page for a
particular blog entry we use post HTML
and this is the HTML for a particular
post I have a class that wraps the whole
thing called post I have a div rather
whose class is post for wrapping the
whole thing I have another div which is
just the heading
this has the this includes the subject
of the post in a death and then also
includes the date the post was written
in another diff using the stir f time is
a handy function when you have a
date/time object in Python and you want
to print a human readable version of it
you can use store F time and this is a
format string if you google for Python
store F time you can see all the
different types of format strings you
can use for printing dates but it's
really handy this won't be the last time
you use their F time in this class so
I'd suggest you give that a peek and
then we have the actual content the
content is included I remember I called
it render text on the object and I did
that so I could replace the new lines
with the breaks without actually
modifying the object this is included
with pipe safe so that means we can
enter HTML in our blog entries you know
but we want to be able to include HTML
on a blog so you can type in lists and
have links and images all of your fancy
HTML formatting generally want to escape
content when we don't trust it in the
case of a blog where it users would have
to register or maybe it's only your blog
you're the only one who could submit you
generally trust the content what a lot
of sites do is they only trust certain
types of HTML they may say you know
lists and links are okay but background
colors and marquees and that stuff is
not OK I didn't want to get into all of
that sort of parsing and stuff so I just
made it all safe which allows you know
you guys to enter in all sorts of junk
on my blog which is fine our next
template is for a permalink this was the
page that showed just one blog entry and
inherits from base HTML and it redefines
the content block to basically render
one blog post that render that calls
that function we define in Python and
include it on escaped</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
