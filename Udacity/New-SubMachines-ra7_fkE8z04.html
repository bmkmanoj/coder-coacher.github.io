suggest that we need to add additional
state machines sub machines to our set
of concurrently executing machines
typically these correspond to internal
timers so you think about it the the
clock radio has some timers in it for
example with the snooze button you know
it has to time ten minutes before it
turns itself off and those those timers
even though they aren't directly or
explicitly visible to the user do affect
things which are visible to the users so
we're going to have to to model them so
the question then arises as which ones
those are how do you come up with that
list of things and one way of doing that
might be to consider events eight
through eleven which are the events that
correspond to pressing and releasing the
wake n and sleep buttons so think for a
minute about what what is going on when
those buttons are pressed and presumably
then the users is also pressing the hour
and minute buttons and you want me to
design a another state machine to
represent this well first first thing
what what what the radio has to do to
deal with those things and see if that
doesn't then suggest that we need to
keep track of some history somehow and
in that then suggest that we need to
have another state machine there ok so I
think based on the but say none of the
buttons are pressed talking about the
the wake button and the sleep button
right that needs to it seems like that
needs to be represented by some kind of
state we say nothing or none or
something and based on that state your
other machines are going to act a
certain way like your when you press the
hour minute button the rest of your
state machines for just in the display
and so on and so forth will act a
certain way but then you have a state
where the wake machine or the wake
button is pressed so that's its own
state and based on it being in that
state your others machines will act sir
so while we're pressing that wake button
we are in a state okay and and that
state then allows us to press the hour
button okay so pressing that our button
while we were in that state has a
different effect that pressing and when
we're not in that state okay so let's
see what such a state machine might look
like</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
