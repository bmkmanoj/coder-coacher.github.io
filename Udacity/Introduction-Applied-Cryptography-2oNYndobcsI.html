homeworks will work in this class is a
little different from what you might
expect if you took CS 101 with me
so there'll be regular homework
questions these will mostly be
multiple-choice or questions where you
need to enter a number or a string
they might involve using programming to
solve problems but you won't be expected
to submit code you'll be writing
programs to be able to answer the
questions that are provided in the
homeworks they'll also be open
discussion problems and these will
usually evolve either designing a
solution to our problem designing a
protocol perhaps or analyzing a provided
solution there's no graded aspect to
these discussions but I think it'll be a
valuable part of the course for you to
think on your own how to solve these
problems and then they join the
discussions in the forums to see how
other people have solved them and to see
whether your solution is popular or
other people notice problems in it the
third kind of problem will be challenged
problems these will be problems that you
can submit answers to
they'll be separate from the regular
homework and these are problems that we
expect to be quite challenging
they'll probably require a fair bit of
time to solve and they'll get more
challenging as the course goes on it's
not necessary to solve these to feel
like you're following the course and
getting a lot out of the course but if
you you do have time and enjoy
challenges I hope you'll tackle the
challenge problems as well if you are
able to solve the challenge problem
please don't spoil the fun for other
students in the class don't post your
solution to the problem until after the
deadline has passed</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
