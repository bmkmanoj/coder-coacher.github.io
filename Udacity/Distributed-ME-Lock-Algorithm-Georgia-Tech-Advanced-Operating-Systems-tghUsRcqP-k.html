for implementing a distributed mutual
exclusion lock algorithm and it is going
to be very similar to the car sharing
example that I showed you before and
also you will notice that we've talked
about locks in a shared memory
multiprocessor where we have shared
memory to implement the lock but now in
a distributed system we don't have
shared memory and we have to implement a
mutual exclusion lock using lamport's
logical clock so essentially what is
going to happen is that any process that
needs to acquire this lock it's going to
send a message to all the other
processes and of course the intent to
get a lock may emanate simultaneously
from several processes that's perfectly
feasible so the algorithm is as follows
every process has a data structure a
queue data structure and this is the
queue that is associated process p1 this
is the queue that is associated with
process p2 and this is a queue that is
associated with process PN every process
has its own private queue and the
private queue is ordered by they
happened before relationship that you
discuss so far so request for a lock are
going to be time stamped and the
protocol is as follows to request a lock
what a process is going to do is send
the message to all the other processes
that I won this lock and my time stamp
is such and so so it is going to
associate the local time stamp that it
has from its counter which is its
logical time stamp it's going to
associate that time stamp as a request
time for the lock and sends a message to
all its peers and all the peers what
they're going to do well two things one
is they're going to stick that request
in to the local queue when a request
comes in from process P and P 1 puts it
into its queue appropriate place in the
queue because it is ordered by the time
stamp the smallest time stamp being the
highest priority requests pending so it
puts it in its queue and the second
thing it does is every process when it
gets a request puts it in its queue and
then acknowledges the request to its P
so let's look at the process p2 here and
p2 generated its request at time-stamped
n what it did was to first put its
request in its local queue and then it
sends a message to its peers and these
guys when they get the request they look
at their own local queue and say well
you know there is a request pending in
my queue which is a time stamp of 5 and
this request that I just got from p2 has
a time stamp of 10 so I'm going to order
that behind the previous request I put
it over here I put it over here and once
I do that I'm gonna acknowledge this
request by sending in a message back to
p2 and similarly this guy sends an
acknowledgement back to p2 so that's how
the protocol works every request is sent
to all the other processors and every
process when it receives a request it
puts it ordered by lamport's clock in
it's all local Q and then acknowledges
the request with an ACK message now what
happens when there's a tie well when we
have a tie we break the tie by giving
priority to the process that has a lower
process ID so that's how this algorithm
works so that every process can
unambiguously make a decision as to
where to place an incoming request in
the queue so an example of the state of
the queue is as shown the thing that
should jump out at you immediately is
that the state of the queue is not the
same in all the processes so for
instance process ones queue contains its
request that it generated at time two
but I don't see it yet in the other
queues is this possible that the queues
can be inconsistent with one another of
course it is possible the reason it is
possible is because a process when it
generates a request puts it in its queue
and then sends a message out this
message is going to take some time to
reach the other nodes in the distributed
system so there's a sentiment and after
it sent a message it got requests from
other processes and it has put it in its
queue and it is possible that this
message all the messages may not take
the same amount of time to traverse the
network we have no idea what's going on
in the network and therefore it so
happened
that P ones message is still in transit
whereas the request messages from p2 and
PN have already made it everywhere and
it is in the queues of all the processes
but P ones message and fortunately it's
taking a slow route through the network
and it is still in transit and in fact
p1 has subsequently received P Jews and
P ends message and put them into it's in
local queue it is just that P was
message hasn't reached its peers yet and
that's how you get the situation so the
whole purpose of this exercise is to
unambiguously get the mutual exclusion
lock for some process that is competing
for it simultaneously now how does the
process know that it has the lock so I
have to make a decision that I have the
lock how do I make the decision two
things have to be true for me to think
that I have gotten the lock so the first
thing is that my request has to be at
the top of the queue so now you see the
messages that I talked about that is P
ones message to P 2 and P and P n not
having reached the destination
eventually they reach the destination
and they have acknowledged it and as a
result of that there's a queues are
consistent now P ones request is at the
top and it also has received
acknowledgments from everybody else so
the way you can make a decision that you
have the lock unambiguously in the
entire distributed system two conditions
first thing my request is at the top of
the queue the second thing is I've
received acknowledgments from all the
other nodes in the system in this case
all the other nodes were not requesting
this lock so they have sent me
acknowledgments and I've received all
the acknowledgments and there is no
other request that is ahead of me I also
receive lock requests from p2 and PN and
they are later than mine and that's how
they've been ordered in the queue so the
two conditions I'm gonna look for to
make a decision locally that I have the
lock is my request is at the top of the
queue and I've either received
acknowledgments from all the other nodes
the system if nobody else is competing
for the lock at the same time or all the
requests that I've gotten so far are
later than my own lock request let's say
that I haven't received the
acknowledgement for my request from qq2
and QN can I go ahead and assume I have
the lock yes I can
why because even though these guys have
not sent me the acknowledgements yet
it's coming it's slowly coming but I've
received lock requests from them with
time stamps 5 and 10 respectively
therefore I can make an unambiguous
decision that my lock request precedes
all the other lock requests at this
point of time and I can go ahead and get
the lock I'm sure you've figured it out
already but since we are following
lamport's clock in implementing this
mutual exclusion lock algorithm the ACT
message for a particular lock request is
going to have a later time stamp than
the time stamp associated the request
itself so you can see that lamport's
logical clock with the addition of a way
of deriving a total order from the
partial order is given by the lamport's
clock allows us to unambiguously
make a decision locally based on the
state of my local queue as to whether I
have the lock or not now let's talk
about how I go about releasing the lock
so if I have the lock I've used it for a
while and now I'm ready to say well I'm
done with a lock I can release it what
do I do
well I'm going to send an unlock message
to all the other guys the first thing
that I do of course is get rid of the
entry that I have in my queue because
I'm done with a lock I can remove it
from my queue once I remove it from my
queue I'm gonna send an unlock message
to everybody else so the state of the
queue indicates that the unlock message
hasn't reached yet it is in transit it
is going to eventually teach these guys
and when the peers receive the unlock
message they're going to basically
remove the entry the corresponding entry
from the respective cubes so p1 Stern
was using the lock as complete now
than its lock-ins none its unlock and
now other processes in the system is
they're competing for the same luck can
use the same decision-making process to
figure out whether they are the winners
for getting the lock next and using it
and entering the respective critical
sections</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
