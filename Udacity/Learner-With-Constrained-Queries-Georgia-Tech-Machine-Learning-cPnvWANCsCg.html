what happens when the learner is now a
part of this now the learner doesn't
have that advantage that the teacher had
of knowing what the actual answer was
and therefore being able to show
specifically what's irrelevant and show
what's relevant so what could the
learner do to try to learn about this so
again remember that there are three to
the K possible hypotheses and if it
could use the 20 questions trick it
could do this in log base 2 of 3 to the
K which is the same as K times log base
2 of 3 which is you know worse than what
we had it's a this is this is larger
than 1 but it's still linear it's still
linear in K so but can we actually do
that I'm gonna say yes I don't think we
can so can you help me figure out how
that would go I was just gonna assert it
and hope you would tell me so how would
we do that well we the trick we did
before is we that we tried to find a
specific question we could ask such that
we would eliminate half the hypotheses
indeed but it's not clear how you could
even ask such a question
yeah so just to do this as a thought
exercise I have a hypothesis in mind
okay and you can ask me anything you
want and I will tell you true or false
but you're gonna have a very painful
time for finding it yeah but that's just
because I'm human okay so I need to find
a question where if I of all the
hypothesis or I have all the possible
three decay hypotheses I want to try to
come up with something that's going to
eliminate a third of them which is just
going to be hard for me to do because I
could write the program to do this I'm
not sure you could I think at the moment
there's well because I didn't choose my
hypothesis at random I chose a specific
hypothesis though I guess I could have
chosen at random from a subset and you
just still have a hard time finding it
but let's just as an exercise throw it
give me a give me a X 1 2 X 5 and I'll
tell you what the output is okay 0 0 0 0
1 or actually you know what all zeroes
all series output is 0 that's what I
said is not what I should have done I
should have no no that's gay I won't cap
that one can I just give you like maybe
3 to the K of them and you're not
counting them until I get it right well
that's the problem right well not 3 to
the K but if you if you know
if you make two to the K guesses you'll
be okay but you'll also have looked at
all possible inputs so that's not really
that interesting but in particular the
example that I'm thinking of you're
gonna have to guess almost this many
just to get a positive example so almost
everything that you throw in is giving
almost no information cuz saying no
doesn't really tell you very much yeah
that's what I was thinking I was
thinking I need to find one where the
answer is yes exactly and I made it so
that it's gonna take you exponential
time just to find one once you found
that one then you're then you're home
free but it's going to take you X you
know it's gonna you essentially have to
enumerate all possibilities before you
find one okay zero zero zero zero one
okay zero zero zero one zero and you're
gonna tell me that zero zero zero
there's only one pattern that gives a 1
right exactly and you're gonna because
every single one of them is relevant and
I'm gonna have to look two of them are
negated this is the only pattern that
gives you a 1 now once you've found that
and you know that that's the only one
now it's easy you can just read off the
equation so what's the equation xn not 2
and X 3 and and X 4 and 9 X 5 and that's
the that's the equation and you're not
gonna you're not there's no as a learner
you're not gonna be able to find that
right because it's just needle in a
haystack until you hit it yeah so it's
it's gonna take me exponential time but
but but remember we're not worried about
time were worried about sample
complexity so remember the cheat that we
have here the cheat that we have here is
that I know all the hypotheses and what
they say it doesn't help you yeah it
does because the hypothesis because
every high point well no that's not true
I'm thinking the wrong thing I'm sorry
I'm cheating you're right I'm cheating
I'm acting as if we had the example you
had before where so this this constraint
in this is really it's very frustrating
right because the question that you
really want to be able to ask you can't
really ask all right you want to be able
to ask a question that that takes the
hypothesis class and split it in half
and well maybe you can I mean you can
nearly do that but it's still gonna be
oh no sorry that would make it linear
let me start let me say that again you'd
like to be able to ask a question that
that that splits this hypothesis class
in half but unfortunately almost all of
your questions give very little
information just knocks out a couple of
the possible hypotheses and so it ends
up being 2 to the K kind of time not
but samples before you can get a handle
on what the hypothesis is so it's it's
harder for the learner to write so when
the learner does it
you have no reasonably one hypothesis
over the other you've got all of them
and so in order to figure it out no and
it kind of has to be that way because
otherwise it's still linear this is
bothering me because if what you said is
true then why does 20 questions work why
do I ever get log-log to write so we'd
like to be able to ask questions so I so
here we can let's play this game now you
think of a formula and i'ma wait wait I
know at the end the answer is is that
the twenty questions is still the
optimal thing to do given that you know
nothing so that that log leads to is
kind of an expected answer but sometimes
you will do much worse and sometimes
you'll do better no in this particular
case if I could ask you more general
questions I can do this in with the you
know linear in K so the questions that
I'd like to ask you are things like is
x1 in the formula yes or no is x1
positive in the formula is x1 negative
in the formula I can just fill in these
boxes by asking the right questions but
those questions are not in our
constrained set and it's the constraint
set that matters here and our constraint
set is in this particular example just
really harsh so and there's no way to
approximate that right so I can't say ok
so the first question we want to ask is
is x1 positive negative or absent so if
I looked at all the hype if I looked at
all the hypotheses I could do that by
asking that's very hard to do because
there's no direct way to ask that
question the only way to ask that
question is I have to try well I have to
try all possible exponential cases to
know yeah cuz we're constrained to only
ask queries that are data points right
so give me the label for this data point
and that's not really the same as is the
hypothesis you're thinking of having
this particular property but as soon as
I get a 1 I know something as soon as
you get a 1 you're in a much happier
place so in fact if we didn't if we had
conjunctions of literals without
negations mm-hmm
we'd be in a much better situation
because then you your first question can
be you know 1 1 1 1 1 1
you know the answer has to be 1 or the
formula is empty and so then you're
you're basically often running but
the fact that there can be negation in
there means that most queries give you
really useless information so so Michael
okay so you've depressed me you
basically said this is really hard to do
to learn because I think we've convinced
ourselves at least you've convinced me
that until I get a one until I get a
positive result I can't really know
anything and eventually I will get one
if I can just do an exponential number
of samples but then my sample complexity
is exponential and I'm sad so what
you're basically saying is I'm sad
sample complexity makes me a bad person
and there's really nothing I can do to
learn anything or get anything good out
of my learning process that seems like a
very sad way of saying it yes is there a
happy way of saying there's a happy way
of saying that but there is there are
other questions that have happier
answers okay like what</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
