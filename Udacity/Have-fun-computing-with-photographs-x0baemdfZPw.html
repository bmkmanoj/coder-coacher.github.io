hopefully you've had a lot of fun and
interesting experiences playing around
with photographs and computation at the
same time we've actually had a lot of
interesting lectures hopefully you've
enjoyed all of the material we have
covered so far and all of the fun
assignments that you've gone through to
learn about the building blocks of
computational photography while the
lecture part of this class is over now I
actually do want to say that I'm going
to be now adding on Piazza and other
types of sites variety of additional
advanced concepts these will be in forms
of research papers websites and videos I
do want you to look at all of this
materials study it and engage with me
and the rest of the class in variety of
conversations on what you think about
these advanced concepts these are
concepts that could be practical to the
kinds of things that you've seen in
existing software packages that you use
too much more research II kind of
pointing a direction towards future of
computational photography I'm going to
try to come up with good idea of
interesting topics again my request is
engage with this material on Piazza chat
with each other we're going to have a
lot of fun trying to play around with
variety of topics in this area but again
it's new advanced concepts that I think
you'll enjoy with that I just like to
say thank you it's been a lot of fun and
remember have fun computing with
photographs</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
