me owing you money and let's say it so
happens that the mutual clock drift is 5
between you and me so my clock when it
reaches 3 p.m. your clock reads 8:00
p.m. so that is the mutual clock drift
that we have and let's say that the
inter process communication time the
lower bound on that is 2 so what happens
is that as I told you earlier I am
telling you anytime after 5:00 p.m. you
can get the money from me for my bank
and so you instructed your bank to debit
at 8:00 p.m. but unfortunately your 8:00
p.m. is my 3:00 p.m. because our mutual
clock drift is 5 so when your request
went out took 2 units of time to get to
the server went out and a central bank
got your message asking for a debit
transaction but the credit is not there
yet
because I'm reading to 5:00 p.m. to
actually send my credit advice to the
bank and therefore your request which
came in at 4 p.m. because you sent it
relative to me your 5 hours ahead and in
terms of real time here actually 6 hours
ahead and so the message is received at
4 p.m. and your request has declined and
this is coming about because of the fact
that your inter process communication
time mu is less than the mutual clock
drift that we are seeing between these
two clocks which is 5 on the other hand
if the mutual clock drift is less than
the inter process communication time so
in this case let's say that the clocks
are more well behaved epsilon is 1
meaning the mutual clock drift between
you and me is just 1 and so exactly the
same scenario when it is 3 p.m. in my
branch your branch is saying your time
is 4 p.m.
of course you've given the advice to
your branch to debit at 8 p.m. so at my
local time 5 p.m. I send a credit advise
proceed with a bank and at your time 8
p.m. which is not quite in sync with
real-time and it is also drifting with
respect to my time but the bound is
less than the lower bound on the inter
process communication time and therefore
when you send your debit request at 8:00
p.m. your local time which actually is
real-time 6:00 p.m. it's perfectly fine
because when it is received in the
central bank the real time is e p.m. and
it is received later than the credit
request and so your request is honored
you're happy and he can go home
so the important takeaway is that in
constructing distributed applications
which depend on real time it is
important to make sure that there are
bounds on individual clock drift as well
as mutual clock drift so individual
clock drift is what might my clock is
reading at any point of time and how far
off is it from real time so that is
individual clock lift and you want that
to be bound by some small value which we
call K and the other important thing is
that you want to make sure that the
mutual clock drift is very very small
also so that there is no anomaly when
there are interactions like what we
showed here and the whole thing hinges
on the relationship between mutual clock
drift the individual clock drift K and
the inter process communication time
informally so long as you make sure that
the inter process communication time is
significantly higher than the clock
drift whether it is mutual or individual
clock drift you can ensure that there
are no anomalies in the system</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
