mind a lot of people think of chess as
their go-to answer others however
especially those in East Asia might give
a different answer
go-go has a number of similarities with
chess both are abstract strategy games
with long histories both are played by
millions of people around the world and
both games have seen strong interest
from the artificial intelligence
community in the development of computer
agents that can play at a master human
level in terms of a I go presents a much
more difficult game for computers AIS to
handle than chess a chess-playing
computer program beat the top chess
professional in 1997 when IBM's deep
blue took on Garry Kasparov
it took nearly a further two decades an
eternity in technology terms for a
computer to defeat a top human
professional and go when google
deepmind's alphago took on lease a doll
in 2016 in terms of rules go is a far
simpler game than chess there's only one
kind of piece and only four basic rules
so what is it about go that makes it so
difficult for computers to play there
are two major reasons first the search
space for go is much larger than it is
for chess a large component of
traditional strategies for chess AIS
includes digging down into game trees
and exploring as many combinatorial
possibilities for moves as possible this
is much less viable for go a single turn
in go consists of the placement of a
stone on one intersection in a 19 by 19
grid in an average turning go a player
might have over 200 unique possible
moves compare this to chess where you
might have an average about 35 moves per
player in addition a typical game of
chess might be about 40 moves per player
compare that to go where a game can be
over 100 moves per player because of
this the exponential explosion from
exhaustive searches are far more taxing
for go than for chess
second the objective of the game and the
heuristics for evaluating which player
is in a better position are much clearer
for chess than they are for go in chess
the objective is clear capture the king
and there are some basic heuristics that
can be learned to evaluate which player
is performing better for example you
might have heard the heuristic of
counting captured pawns as one point
knights and bishops as three points and
so on heuristics like this are used for
chess a eyes to focus on parts of the
game tree to search down and go there
isn't an easy heuristic for figuring out
who's doing better the objective of the
game is to surround the most territory
but it can be difficult to count
territory as completely secure until the
borders are complete one player might
make some solid corner territory early
in the game but the opponent may be
compensated with a strong wall on the
outside which has the potential to be
worth more in order to succeed and go a
computer program cannot use brute force
on loan an AI needs to emulate the
pattern matching and intuition that
humans perform in order to shortcut the
search space and explore only the most
promising moves the addition of deep
neural networks to emulate this
human-like thinking is a major
contributor to alphago success not just
its ability to play at the top level but
also its ability to generate moves that
defy conventional wisdom ever since
alphago's games against lee say dull go
players of all levels have been trying
to learn from its style of play in
January of 2017 alphago played 60 online
matches against some of the world's top
players including the top professionals
of China Korea and Japan without losing
a single game go is a game that's easy
to learn but it's also a game that
you'll learn from for an entire lifetime
I've only been playing for about a year
so I'm still a fairly poor player but
because of how little I know I'm
constantly seeing and learning new
things
the main appeal of go to me is the
beauty of how the game flows from its
simple rules
hopefully this video has given you an
insight into what makes NGO such a
complex game for computers and what
makes it tricky for humans as well but
the best way of understanding is to try
for yourself if you're interested take a
look at the next video in the series and
in only a few minutes you'll be ready to
play your first game</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
