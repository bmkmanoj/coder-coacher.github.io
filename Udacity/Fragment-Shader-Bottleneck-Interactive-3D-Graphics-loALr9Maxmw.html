told that the fragment shader is turning
out to be a huge bottleneck in this
extremely primitive GPU design made by
Acme GPUs and bubble gum incorporated
their GPU has a single vertex shader and
a single fragment shader processor this
is pretty pitiful and in fact is what
differentiates different GPUs in the
same class some will be more powerful
simply because they have more shaders on
the chip modern GPUs process hundreds if
not thousands of vertices and pixels
simultaneously with these cores which is
why they are called massively parallel
Acme knows that they'll need to add more
cores to be competitive so they're
making a much larger chip they know that
it'll be able to have a few hundred
separate vertex shaders and separate
fragment shaders plus room for other
features you've been hired to design
their next chip which will have many
more transistors available your team
brainstorms a few architectural ideas
and you are asked to evaluate these your
task is to decide what's worth
considering reverse the order performing
the fragment shader before the vertex
shader test the z-depth before running
the fragment shader and abort if test
fails rework the shader cores so they
can be used as vertex shaders or
fragment shaders and the last idea is
divide each triangle into four smaller
triangles and render these personally I
think half of these ideas are worth
exploring further</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
