learning and we did unsupervised
learning and randomized optimization yep
and the last section of the course was
on reinforcement work nice now there's a
lot of stuff we didn't cover in that
section of the course which sort of
makes me sad because that's what I do
for a living I do reinforcement learning
a little bit of game theory you do a lot
of game theory and a lot of
reinforcement learning and there were a
bunch of things that we didn't cover can
you think of anything in particular you
wish well I think the thing that most
people want to know about when they hear
about reinforcement learning is function
approximation so the idea of can you
apply this idea to something other than
a three by three grid world right and so
to do that you often have to use the
ideas that we talked about in the other
sections of the class so use ideas from
supervised learning to learn something
about the environment that you are
acting it for even things from
supervised learning section in the class
like feature selection feature selection
them and in fact that general the the
notion of function approximation is sort
of a special case maybe you use the
right term of abstraction in particular
State of Trance straight a fraction
action abstraction this sort of notion
of being able to to learn about one part
of the space and have it teach you about
other parts of space generalization
generalization in general yeah that's a
big part of making reinforcement
learning work in the real world so you
in which there's a zombie peas we didn't
talk about yeah I get asked about that a
lot so check see what it is there's
people on the street walk up to you and
say palm be Peas what's that all about
it's surprising usually it's after after
class what I'm talking about so so
partially observable Markov decision
processes right so when we talked about
without the PO mm-hmm MDP I yeah all
right so when you talk about mdps the
agent always has complete information
about what the current state is right
that's the state is what you're using to
decide what to do the policy maps state
to action but in reality you don't
really have complete state information
you have to fear a helicopter you're
flying through the air you have to
decide what to do based on what you can
sense right now and there may be even
uncertainty about what's actually going
on around you right and so you can't
just use state information because you
don't have it so in the pom DP world
there's a separation between what the
actual
world has its current state and what the
decision-maker knows to be its
perception of the state and those can be
out of whack what is happening and for
every atom in the universe and it might
actually matter so you know there's a
whole nother class of problems that I
wish we could have talked about that we
didn't and those are all the ones that
involve humans ah a lot of game theory
is you know mathematical abstract but
really it's about trying to understand
human behavior right in fact there's
been a bunch of work done on bringing in
behavior into a game theory in game
theory into behavior marrying economics
game theory sociology marketing and
psychology right right right yeah I mean
behavioral game theory is is one of the
names for that though neuro economics
also comes up as a word that just seems
like it shouldn't be a word yeah except
I will pay you in brain cells brain
that's that's the currency that zombies
use okay so there's a lot of that about
people in game theory but even in
reinforcement learning there's been a
huge move actually dating back decades
but really has exploded over the last
four or five years well in fact what is
the name of the school that you're in at
Georgia Tech the school yeah that's an
interaction turns out to be a really
important thing to some people all right
so a lot of my work in reinforcement
learning in particular has been about
bringing people into the look learning
from people watching what people do in
order to do feature selection or state
abstraction or just a simple learn so
some of my best friends care about
people are you saying I'm your best
friend Michael okay so there's a whole
bunch of stuff I said some of my best
friends you are some of my best I am
some of your I don't know but the point
is the point is that yeah that that this
there's this interesting line that
happens when you start thinking about
how these learning systems are
interacting with people either once they
start to behave in the world or just
during the learning process itself right
because in fact in practice that's how
we teach it so obviously we can talk
about this forever yeah I'll just
mention one let me just want mention one
buzzword so okay inverse reinforcement
learning is one that I particularly like
because we talked about reinforcement
learning in the class where you take a
reward function and interaction with an
environment and you create behavior an
inverse reinforcement learning goes in
the other direction
you look like thinking a bit
no I you start from observations of
behavior interacting in an environment
that some expert is doing and you try to
guess what the reward function was that
that expert would have been using
exactly because you can't know really
how rewarding is it to you know say get
grown debt when you make a pun but you
can tell that it's obviously more
rewarding than not right but you know
reward function a reward function times
seven is thank you yeah because you can
scale them and it doesn't change what
the behavior looks like that's right and
so we don't actually so what we take
away from this is some representation of
the motivations desires of the
individual who demonstrated the behavior
that we can then transfer into new
environments and get good behavior I
think it's even broader than that which
is really you can think of think of this
whole reinforcement learning framework
as a kind of programming framework it's
sort of hearing and where reinforcement
signals are the mechanism by which you
program the agent in order to get some
particular behavior as opposed to simple
function calls and then seems like
there's a whole discussion to have I
like that top agreement in fact I think
we should write a grant proposal about
that that's right a grandpa bull
whatever may be a paper to triple yak
nice yeah let's do that
so look I think it's obvious that we can
talk about reinforcement learning
forever even though we didn't spend a
lot of time on it in the class because
there's all these basic things you
really have to get about supervised
learning about circles but how how can
we get all this information out there I
can think of one way
direct brain interface no okay I mean
yes but no okay we could do another
class ah you mean like together yes we
can do a whole class of reinforcement
learning game through and explore all
these ideas but who would even want to
come to such a class everyone because
we're gonna make it required oh that's
great
mm-hmm let's do that let's do that let's
make a class on reinforcement learning
yes we do nice three-hour course on
reinforcement learning and game theory
and we can do all we can come back and
do all the same thing we can use the
same editor yeah though it's very
possible that he'll cut this out if we
even talk about it
Pushkar will be there you know get the
band back together again that sounds
really fun and the groupies could be the
same yes we could have exactly the same
set so you want to do it I I think I
would let's try going let's do this
thing done all right well then see you
in the next class yeah we'll get started
next week</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
