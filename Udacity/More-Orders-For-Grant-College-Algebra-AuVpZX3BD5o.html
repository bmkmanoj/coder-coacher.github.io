straightforward equation for the amount
of money that grants friends are going
to pay him once they buy their glasses
wipers and their spray nozzles however
just when we think we're starting to
figure things out for him situation gets
a little bit more complicated even
though this means more work for us this
is great for grant because more of his
friends have asked if they can buy his
products the day after his first round
of requests came in even more of his
friends and his friends friends heard
about his new incredible inventions and
asked him to add them to the list of
people to buy his products 51 more
people requested glasses wipers and 25
more people wanted to buy to spray
nozzles each this equation no longer
tells us the total amount of money that
grants going to earn from his friends
and his friends friends buying his
wipers and nozzles so what we need to do
is create a new equation we need to come
up with a different way to express a
that takes into account this new
information that we have but also
doesn't forget what we had before</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
