about if you've got this way of
recovering depth how do you represent
depth that is how do you think about the
representation but we only actually
talked about disparity we we talked a
little bit about depth images but not
too much but I want to talk about just
two quick methods here one is a depth
image and then there's a slightly more I
use the word nuanced a little more
recent notion of representing death
depth namely point clouds so depth
images as shown here this was another
one of those stereo figures from the
middlebury data stereo dataset and this
is a ground truth known depth image
right so you see these rings here right
well you see that this one's darker and
brighter and brighter though they're at
different depths likewise this picture
here is this picture there it's brighter
than this mannequin back there because
it's closer and if we had more grayscale
resolution you would see this would be
darker than then then this area because
the nose is further back from the cheek
so depth images have some nice
representations first of all I've got
depth everywhere right I can just go to
every pixel and say what's your depth
which it so I've got a full dense depth
representation something that's a little
more subtle is that a depth image not
only tells you it's two meters from here
to that table it also tells me that
between here and that point is free
space so it doesn't just represent the
surface it also represents by default if
you will that there is no stuff between
here and there all right so the putting
the point down there is also declaring
that the Ray from my eyeball to that
point is free so it's a representation
both of the surface end of free space
people don't make nearly enough use of
that fact but it's true and important
the other thing is often we need to
think about depth discontinuities well
depth discontinuities are just edges in
in a depth image where we have lots of
processing for dealing with them at
images there are of course disadvantages
one is that it's very viewpoint
dependent right I've got this scene
geometry but my depth image is based
upon where my camera
is so if I move over here I've got a
different depth image and combining them
is difficult because they're in the
reference frame of my image they're not
in sort of some natural reference frame
that talks about the object so it
doesn't capture the geometry quite so
much and the other thing is if I want to
think about reasoning about the geometry
I kind of need to know where the camera
is with respect to this in order for me
to talk about where the geometry is</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
