dram systems such as the ones used by
high-performance GPUs transfer large
chunks of data per transaction and
therefore if you can coalesce your
memory requests by many threads that are
performing a transaction at the same
time then you'll get many more useful
bites out of that transaction so the
second statement that dram systems
transferred data and many small chunks
is simply false and the third statement
that GPUs have no on chip caches to
prefetch data that's also false modern
GPUs do have on chip caches although it
is the case that prefetching data is not
a particularly effective strategy for
GPUs the caches are quite small
considering the number of threads that
are trying to use them and so you can't
really afford to speculatively load data
that some thread might use ok you have
tens of thousands of threads that are
actually trying to use those caches to
hold data so prefetching is not an
effective strategy and this is also not
a correct answer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
