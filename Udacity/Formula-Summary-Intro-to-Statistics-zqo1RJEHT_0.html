going to write it as X for exponential
minus a half x minus mu square over
Sigma square and the truth is when you
new to this is looks VD cryptic when you
with statistics for many years as I have
been you wake up in the middle of the
night and you can recite this formula is
as normal as getting breakfast in the
morning or having a beer after dinner
but I want to get into your brains is
not the complexity of the formula I want
you to really understand how this
formula is constructed I want understand
the quadratic Kennedy terms of
deviations from the expectation of the
mean of this expression and then the
exponential that squeezes back into the
valve yep curves that's basically what
it is so we can draw values from this
normal distribution just the same way as
he flipped coins before and the way to
look at this is any value X has this
probability up here this is nothing else
but a notation of the probability of X
for normal distribution with mu and
Sigma square so a value X that has twice
a high bar than some other value X prime
will if twice as much of a probability
of being drawn now obviously the normal
has an entire continuous space of
outcomes and obviously their vendors
each individual autocom outcome of
probably zero but in essence you can
think of the height of this thing over
here as being proportional to the
probability that this value is being
drawn</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
