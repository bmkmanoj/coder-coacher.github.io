having taken this course you will be
able to recognize what makes a problem
challenging for a computer to solve you
will also have an understanding of why
these problems are challenging and
through that understanding I will show
you a number of techniques that you can
use to navigate around computational
complexity so this course will not only
enable you to recognize and understand
tough problems but also give you many
tools and techniques that you can use to
actually solve them in practice and this
is something that in my experience is
not taught very often so some people
will be able to recognize that a problem
is challenging fewer people will
understand what makes these problems
challenging but when it comes down to
knowing the techniques that you can use
to solve these challenging problems
despite their computational complexity
then my experience is that knowing these
techniques can really make you stand out
during this course we will come across
many algorithms especially when we study
complexity theory but this is not a
course about algorithms in general
rather they will be a means to an end to
understand what makes problems hard and
of course also to navigate around
computational complexity so for taking
this course you should have a basic
understanding of algorithms although
we'll also cover the basics to make sure
that you all start out on the same level</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
