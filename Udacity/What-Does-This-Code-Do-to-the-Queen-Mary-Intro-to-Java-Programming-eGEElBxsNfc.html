half with a rotation of the top half
this question should have been really
hard you have to think about the order
of the numbering of all of the pixels
and imagine everything that happens in
the right order you haven't seen a
problem like this before if these were
all the pixels of the image this one
would be 0 this would be one this would
be picked up pixels minus one and this
would be picked up pixels minus two now
in the first iteration of this loop we
would get color see from the I pixel
which would be the zeroth pixel then we
would find picked up pixels minus one
minus I which in this case would be
picked out pixels minus one minus zero
so the last pixel and set its color to
the color saved and see so we just
copied the color from here into here now
on the next iteration will get the color
from one right here find the pixel at
picked up pixels minus one minus one so
right here and copy the color into here
it's starting to look like we're just
going to rotate the whole image but not
quite imagine that I gets to this second
to last spot will get the color at the
second to last spot and then we'll get
the pixel at the second spot and will
copy the color from the second to last
spot back into the second spot but this
is the color the second spot already had
so the first half of the image won't
change only the second half of the image
will</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
