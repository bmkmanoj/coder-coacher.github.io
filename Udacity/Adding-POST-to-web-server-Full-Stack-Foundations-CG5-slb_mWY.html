of do get let's take this web server to
the next level with some post
functionality gates are good for viewing
information already on the server but
poster would allow the user to customize
their web experience get requests happen
simply by visiting a URL in a browser
but post requests from a browser require
data to be submitted like with a form
I'm going to add a post method such that
our server doesn't just say hello or
hola
but whatever the user prompts is a
salutation on the same level as my do
get method I will create another method
called do post which overrides the
method in the base HTTP request handler
superclass just like do git I'll make
another try except block similar to my
do get methods when I receive a post
request
I'll send off the response code that
indicates a successful post next I need
to decipher the message that was sent
from the server in order to do this I'm
gonna use some message from the CGI or
common gateway interface library in
Python so I'll add import CGI to the top
of my file let's take a look at the
following chunk of code I'm going to add
this CGI dot parts header function
parses an HTML form header such as
content type into a main value and
dictionary of parameters after that we
check and see if this is formed out of
being received I then make a variable
called fields which we use the CGI dot
parse multi parse to collect all of the
fields in a form then I will make a
variable called message content to get
out the value of a specific field or set
of fields and store them in an array I
will call this field message here and
when I create my HTML form so now that
I've received a post request I can
decide what to tell the client with the
new information I've received I will
create an empty string named output
again and then add some opening HTML
tags to it I'll have my server respond
with okay how about this and then return
the first value of the array that was
created when I submitted the form hmm
well you might be thinking hey you
haven't even created a HTML form but
keep talking about it in the post
handler and you'd be right so I'll go
ahead and do that now
in this line of HTML code I'm adding a
post request along with a header tag to
prompt the user to input some data here
I wrote the name of my input field as
message to coincide with the message
field I'm extracting data from in the
post request I'm going to copy this line
of code and paste it into my hello and
oh I get requests so this form will
present on their pages as well I will
also separate out my opening and closing
HTML tags on their own line of code let
me not forget to close the body and HTML
tags in my post handler send the output
out to the server and print out the
output for debugging in my exception
block I will just leave it as past for
now let's see these new changes in
action from the web browser</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
