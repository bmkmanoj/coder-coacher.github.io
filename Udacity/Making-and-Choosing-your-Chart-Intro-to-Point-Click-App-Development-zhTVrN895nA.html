from the report
not all chart types are accounted for in
the report itself but what's great about
creating a chart directly from the
report is if you put it in multiple
dashboards it can have a uniform way of
showing all that data across all those
different dashboards so if we click
customize and go back into the report we
can add a chart type straight to our
report right here oh nice and so what do
you think bar chart that probably sounds
like it makes the most sense our chat
makes sense yeah so on the x-axis total
spent with a vertical of a bar chart
okay so XX is someone to be purchase
date yeah and y-axis my total spend yes
and so click this group by field here
and we probably want to get type oh cool
okay that's very cool but what's really
great is we can also change how it looks
so maybe if you wanted to stack them so
they're in one versus the other
oh nice yeah sure let's stack them so
really quick let's just look at
formatting and see if there's anything
we want to change there I give it a
title we also probably want to enable
the hover so that when we hover over any
part of the chart we actually see how
much was spent for any individual cool
hit okay awesome so there's our little
preview right there based off of the
preview data but if we now save and then
run report then we can create another
dashboard component off of this oh that
is awesome so it looks like in June we
were selling a lot of tickets actually
in June June was interesting because not
only did we sell out tickets we sold
about the same as in July for general
admission but VIPs were crazy there must
have been a special or something or
maybe just the people who are really
into the festival like buy early or
something yeah they get to be a VIPs
alright that's pretty cool
so now I can are you guessing I can
figure out how to add this to the
dashboard well yeah okay try it out you
already saved it okay so saving was not
the right idea there but I'm so
terrified missing out that I'd like say
it a lot okay okay dashboard gonna have
to edit all right so I want to make my
bar chart
I'm gonna drag this over I'm not sure if
I need to do that my data source is
total revenue by month okay that gave me
a graph but this doesn't have the like
the blue and the green sections that's
it's making me sad should a but should
you help little wrench little wrench
always a little wrench it's a little
wrench is such a good tool okay so if
you notice that little check box in the
upper left use chart just to find that
make sense okay so I used the chart that
I made in the report and it gave me my
favorite thing very cool maybe we should
edit the title and then save and run
this dashboard again sure how do I run a
dashboard click close yep
save and close yep so this is not what a
user would see what we were just looking
at that was hard this is the interview
yeah this is what a user would see this
is a little prettier all right this is
very cool so we can track revenue by
month you track total festival revenue
um what do you think it looks really
good um but I don't know if a bar chart
would have been the best way to display
that data like can you think of another
type of chart that we could have used
that might have been better</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
