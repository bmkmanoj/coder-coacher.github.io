work entirely and we look now at why it
doesn't work let's consider only two
cores core 0 which we will show in blue
color what it's doing and core 1 which
will show in this color what it's doing
what they're both doing initially is
doing something before they arrive to
the barrier and let's say that core 0
rice here first so what core 0 does is
resets release 20 increments the count
21 unlocks the lock checks whether the
count is equal to 2 and start spinning
waiting for the release to become one so
now release is still 0 because we just
reset it and core 0 is going to stay
here spinning so what core 0 does is it
essentially does a load word of release
c0 and we'll check again and it keeps
doing that now let's see what happens
when core one arrives normally what
should happen is core one arrives
doesn't do this because count is now one
increments the count exits the critical
section sees that the count is equal to
two resets the count sets the release to
one and now core one proceeds past the
barrier what should happen now is cause
zero should see this release that we
just said to one and also proceed past
the barrier so what should happen is
really that we set the release 2 1 here
and core 0 sees that exits the barrier
and from then everything will actually
be correct but let's say that core 0 has
been checking the release however when
the store happens core 0 is delayed for
example it's executing some sort of an
interrupt function so for a while it's
suspended in this place in the code and
cannot read the release fast enough in
that case we don't have this and core 0
is still stuck here in a correct
battered implementation core 0 will
eventually live at some point it will
return from the interrupt read the
release that is one and proceed
however what happens if core 0 is
waiting here while core 1 after
releasing and exiting the barrier does
very little work and then comes back to
the barrier again it sees that the count
is zero because it reset it to zero when
it was releasing the barrier and sets
the release to one and now it writes 02
the release variable and now even if
core 0 checks the release here and sees
what it is it's going to see this 0 so
chorus 0 is gonna proceed to wait here
for a very long time meanwhile core 1
increments the count 21 checks if it's
equal to 2 for this second iteration of
the barrier it's not to soak or one is
now going to spin waiting for somebody
to release the second instance of the
barrier while core 0 is going to be
waiting there in the first instance of
the barrier and never being released so
the only thing that can really score one
now is if course there are somehow left
and enter the second instance of the
barrier the only thing that can really
score 0 however is if somebody comes and
releases here but that's not going to be
core to so now we have a deadlock
situation</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
