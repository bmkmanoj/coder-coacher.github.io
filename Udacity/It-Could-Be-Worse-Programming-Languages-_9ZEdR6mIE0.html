how to specify tokens for languages like
HTML and JavaScript and at this point
you might be thinking boy those HTML and
JavaScript designers did not make pretty
tokens I just want to mention an
experience from my own life it could be
much worse I once had the opportunity to
work on software that did let's say
collaborative edits and say that a bunch
of people wanted to make changes to a
book like Pride and Prejudice by Jane
Austen suppose that you really want to
make it about pandas instead of people
and I really want to make mr. Darcy
nicer because he is a bit snappish in
the book as it stands in theory we
should be able to apply both of these
edits together as long as they don't
conflict and then someone could download
that new version of the book and read it
with happy pandas all around because I
didn't know much about language design
at the time I made all of these editing
commands very long and very verbose
including one keyword token that now
lives in infamy for me but only if it
changes all separated by underscores one
word must be capital letters which manto
if there's nothing that would change in
this scene for example because it
doesn't have mr. Darcy in it there's no
way to make him happier then don't do
anything so that people don't think they
have to redownload the book or
redownload that chapter because I didn't
have any experience with language design
i made this super long token name and
now i'm stuck with it forever you too
can find it on google if you search so
although it may seem now like HTML and
JavaScript are totally arbitrary in fact
some effort has gone into making them
concise and relatively easy I just
wanted to mention that it could be worse
I know from personal experience</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
