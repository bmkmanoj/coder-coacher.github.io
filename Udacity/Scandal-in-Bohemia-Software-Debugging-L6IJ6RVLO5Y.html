today's topic is tracking origin meaning
how to start with a failure and
trackback origins of the failure until
you find the defect that causes it but
before we get there a bit of a story if
you're a fan of Sherlock Holmes you may
recall this famous scene in a scandal in
Bohemia here we have dr. Watson and
Sherlock Holmes sitting by the fireplace
they haven't seen each other for some
time and Sherlock remarks that Watson
has put on seven and a half pounds since
their last man and Watson says how do
you know ensure look answers I see I
deduce it not only does Sherlock find
out that Watson has put on seven pounds
he also remarks that Watson has been
getting very wet lately and that his
servant girl is clumsy and careless
again worsen ask how on earth do you
find that out oh it is simplicity itself
shall access what home sees is that on
the inside of dr. Watson's shoe there is
a small number of scratches which you
can see in the firelight he deduces that
these scratches have been applied by
somebody who very carelessly tried to
clean the shoe possibly dr. Watson's
servant and since the shoe had to be
cleaned with such a rough device this
likely came from mud through which dr.
Watson had to run through while getting
very wet this is how Sherlock Holmes
proneness it from a single observation
can deduce all the events that led to
this observation I should add that faced
with this explanation dr. Watson
exclaims when show up I hear you give
your reasons the thing always appears to
me to be so ridiculously simple that I
could easily do it myself though at each
successive instance of your reasoning I
am baffled until you explain your
process</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
