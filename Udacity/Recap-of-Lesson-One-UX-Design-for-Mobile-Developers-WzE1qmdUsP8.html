learn what is user experience and the
steps we followed were we define user
experience and we gave you a super
awesome example and demonstrated how a
need for speed and Portia's is a really
great example of user experience was my
favorite step yes and the second step
was we disambiguated UI from UX we
talked a little bit about the difference
between visual and non-visual code we
also gave you two really great examples
of how to improve your apps user
experience today with the sign-in and
checkout flow and we also touched on low
res wireframing which is a really great
technique for starting at the high level
and not focusing on the details to start
with so in lesson 2 you're going to
learn how to make applications that
people love to use by focusing in on
your end user but before we get into
lesson 2 you're gonna watch some
interviews from some real users yeah and
as you're watching these videos of real
users actually interact with
applications make a note of what makes
them unhappy and what makes them happy
in in these applications and also make a
mental note of whether the things they
mentioned are related to visual or non
visual code</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
