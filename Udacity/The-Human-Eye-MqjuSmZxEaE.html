up the visual system starting at the
bottom which of course is the eye and
here is a sort of a schematic picture of
the eye and you know lights coming in
this way and there are a variety of
structures let's see a couple of a
little mention so you have this lens
here lens changes what's in focus and by
the way you have what might be thought
of as a spherical retina and so yeah the
subset spherical retinas are a lot
easier to deal with planar retinas we
make we put planar retinas and cameras
things that spherical means all the Rays
are sort of the same which is kind of
nice the other thing to notice on these
lenses is that they're attached by these
fibers right here and those fibers pull
on the lens and they cause the lens to
deform which changes the focus and
that's how you focus near and far that's
how you focus near and far the way I
focus near and far is I put on reading
glasses why is that because I'm old well
I'm not that old but what happens in my
eyeballs think I'm old in fact some time
riding around my 40th birthday I looked
at my watch and I was trying to wonder
how my watch new is my 40th birthday
because it decided to go out of focus
just that day but what happens is the
ability of your those fibers to deform
that lens that let it hardens up a bit
and you lose the ability to form the
lens as much and you can't do near focus
and that's why you see those of us with
less hair carrying around reading
glasses so the lens focuses the light
coming in goes through this center area
called the pupil you have a certain
amount of adjustment of the size of the
pupil to in terms of the amount of light
that's in there we'll talk about the
dynamic range in a minute and then what
happens is light passes through a clear
liquid which keeps the eye and it's
shaped and it projects onto this back
area called the retina okay and one of
the things you'll also notice in here is
that there's this optic nerve there's
also a bunch of blood vessels that come
in and feed the retina and we'll talk in
a little bit about how come it is that
it comes all the way up through here so
that it actually sees the the middle
here that is it's not just in the back
but when you look in there what
she would see is a funny little area
it's referred to as the optic disc or
the blind spot and in fact if you've
ever been to an ophthalmologist and he
looks in your eye what he sees is
something like this all right that's
assuming everything is healthy so there
are all these blood vessels that are
nurturing the the retina and then
there's this area in the middle where
the blood vessels and the nerves are
coming together and that's your blind
spot</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
