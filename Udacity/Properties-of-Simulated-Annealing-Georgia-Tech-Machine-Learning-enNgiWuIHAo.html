simulated annealing now we already
talked about two of them this idea that
as the temperature goes to zero it's
acting more like hill climbing only
taking steps that improve the fitness
and as T goes to infinity it's like a
random walk around the neighborhood so
where ever point where it is it's
willing to go to any of the other points
in the neighborhood and it just doesn't
it doesn't really pay any attention to
the fitness function anymore so so that
makes sense right if I wanted to go with
the analogy high temperatures like a lot
of heat which is a lot of energy and so
molecules bounce around a lot that kind
of has the effect of flattening out the
fitness function T goes to zero that's
no energy it's like you frozen molecules
can't move and so you only move to
places with lower energy or in this case
higher fitness so that'll make sense so
how do I get from one to the other you
haven't you had any algorithm decrease T
but do we need to decrease T quickly
slowly what's the right way to do it so
in practice we want to decrease the
temperature slowly because it gives it
the system kind of a chance to explore
at the current temperature before we
start to cool it out so one way to think
about it is if you think if you consider
some kind of function that we're trying
to optimize when the temperature is high
it kind of doesn't notice big valleys
it's it's willing to kind of wander
through big valleys as the temperature
gets cooler the valleys become
boundaries and it starts to break things
up into different basins of attraction
but smaller gullies it still is able to
walk walk over as the temperature gets
even lower those become barriers as well
and so what we really want to do is give
it a chance to kind of wander to where
the high valued points are before
cooling it so much that it can't now
bridge the gulf between different local
optima okay that makes sense so property
is it sort of bouncing between
exploration and exploitation I buy that
so where do you end up where do you end
up well for lucky we end up at the
global optimum yay is there anything you
know we could say we could characterize
how often we end up there or we're going
to have to do randomized restarts and do
simulated annealing a million times so
we're not gonna be able to go through
the argument for exactly why this is
true
but there is a remarkable fact about
simulated annealing that is worth
mentioning that the probability of
ending at any any given point X in the
space is actually e to the fitness of X
divided by the temperature and then
normalized because this is a probability
distribution over the input space so
this is this is pretty remarkable right
so this is saying that it's most likely
to be in the places that have high
fitness right because that's those are
where it's going to have the highest
probability of being and you can see now
what the relationship with the
temperature is here to that as we bring
the temperature down this is going to
act more like a max it's going to put
all the probability mass on the actual X
star that the the optimum and as the
temperatures is higher it's going to
smooth things out and it'll be randomly
all over the place so so that's why it's
really important that we eventually get
down to a very low temperature but if we
again if we get there too quickly then
it can be stuck right because it's
spinning again time proportional to the
fitness so it is spending time ending up
at points that are not the optimum if
there are say close to the optimum okay
so you know I actually now that you you
spell that out actually recognize this
distribution it has a name it's called
the Boltzmann distribution that's
exactly right and if there's people
listening that have physics background
they're going to probably be poking
their eyes out because it's the case
that we're using a number of physics
concepts but we don't quite use the same
notation and we don't quite do things
exactly the way that a physicist would
so there's definitely a relationship and
the Boltzmann distribution is used quite
a bit in in the physics community but it
may not be exactly like that so don't
try not to panic yeah it's more like an
analogy like so much of life it's a
simulated Boltzmann distribution it's
like a simile</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
