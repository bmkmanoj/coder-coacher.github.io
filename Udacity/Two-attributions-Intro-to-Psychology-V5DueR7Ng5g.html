you agreed to meet at a local coffee
shop to study you've met this person at
the coffee shop three different
occasions and on each occasion the
persons late after the third time the
person comes late you think to yourself
that this person is just lazy or maybe
they're selfish because whatever they're
doing must be so much more important
than meeting you on time this is an
example of dispositional attribution
because you're explaining the person's
behavior from an internal cause that is
that they're lazy
so dispositional attributions are when
we explain other people's behavior as
being due to something from within the
individual such as a person's
personality talent attitude or
motivation so let's take this example
again of a person being repeatedly late
to a study session perhaps you think the
reason why the person is late is because
they've gotten caught up at something at
work and couldn't leave on time or
perhaps because they were traffic or the
person was home helping their sick
mother if you were to use one of these
reasons for explaining the individuals
tardiness then you would be using
situational attribution a situational
attribution is when we think that
something outside of a person such as
the nature of a situation or
circumstance is the cause of the
behavior</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
