tmk from Pakistan the student asks what
are some good programming practices and
how important is it to follow program
practices used by professionals things
related to like naming variables
commenting your code being consistent
with the structure things like that so
this is a great question there are
definitely many things that people learn
as they get more experienced in
programming we're focused in this class
on learning the basic concepts on
getting you able to write and understand
short programs I'm trying to use good
practices in most of the programs and
hopefully those will come across but
people have different opinions about the
right way to code things some opinions
are better than others I think most
cases I am the opinions that I have are
reasonably good ones most are most of
the time we hope and you'll develop your
own style you'll develop your own
experience as you get more experienced
as a programmer how you like to do
things but there are conventions that is
useful to follow and part of the reason
it's useful to call it follow
conventions is you want it so other
programmers can understand your code and
things like using lower case names of
the using lower case letters at the
start of a variable name are just
conventions and that's used to
distinguish variable names from other
things that you might see in a program
there's no really good reason for that
but that's a convention that most
programmers follow and it's good for you
to follow it too so if other people need
to read your code they'll be able to
understand it more easily</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
