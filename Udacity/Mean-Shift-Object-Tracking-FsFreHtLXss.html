bunch of things is under some reasonable
assumptions like this the shape of the
thing that you put down which is a
carnal kind of thing you can prove that
in most circumstances this thing will
convert so it'll actually find those
modes and that's really cool so what
does this have to do with tracking you
might ask what does this have to do with
tracking so basically means shift
tracking is instead of just tracking the
mean of a distribution we're gonna try
to track essentially a something about a
distribution of a regional I'll make
that clear but our methodology is pretty
similar to before we have some position
that we start with right and here by the
way our initial model is not just the
location but it's this region and the
size of that region and what we have to
do is we search we're gonna search in a
neighborhood in the next frame for that
same description okay and when we do the
search we're gonna move around an X Y we
might also do things like change the
scale all right and what we want to do
is we want to find the the new location
maybe scale maybe some other change
maybe an orientation thing that
maximizes some similarity function all
right and then we just iterate we
connect the dots and we repeat the
process and we got this beautiful
animation that says okay the new maximum
becomes the start for the next frame</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
