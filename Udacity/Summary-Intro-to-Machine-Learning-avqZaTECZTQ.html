blocks of techniques you start with the
data set or the question that inspires
you you try to extract the information
from it in the form of features you feed
those features into a machine learning
algorithm this is the heart of machine
learning and then you evaluate that
entire process to see how good you've
done one of the hardest things is
actually coming with the data set or the
question that interests you
so one example that I loved was the
Enron data set for you this will be
something different we spent a lot of
time a class on features how to present
features how to get rid of features and
how to find new feature spaces it
actually worked better and you can apply
these techniques to pretty much a data
set do you get really reasonable feature
sets the heart and soul of this class
were the algorithms which is were the
most fun isn't machine learning you know
that they are supervised if we have
labels they're unsupervised severe
labels they actually more classes and
machinery we didn't talk about but for
the sake of this class this is what we
told you and really important is each
algorithm needs to be tuned and we
talked about quite a bit how the tuning
algorithms last but not least will be
the evaluation how well are you doing
there's different types of evaluation
metrics that you can use depends on
depending on what's most important to
you and at this point once you've worked
your way through from beginning to end
the evaluation metric will tell you if
you want to go back and revisit any of
these steps or if you're happy with your
results and you're ready to move on and
the cool thing is this is the entire
class on one slide is that amazing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
