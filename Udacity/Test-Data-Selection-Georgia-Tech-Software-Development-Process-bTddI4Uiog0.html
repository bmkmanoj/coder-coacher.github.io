testable features the next step is to
identify the relevant inputs for each
one of these features and there are many
ways to do that so what we're going to
do instead of looking at them all is
that we're just gonna focus on two
different ways of doing it and there are
fairly general ways so they are
applicable to a number of situations and
in addition what I will do I will point
you to other sources in which you can
look at different ways of doing this in
the class notes the problem of
identifying relevant inputs for some
software or some feature of it is called
test data selection and can be expressed
as follows let's consider our software
as usual we have our input domain which
is the set of all the inputs for my
software and again as usual we have our
output domain which is the set of
corresponding outputs for these inputs
so the question here is how can we
select a meaningful set of inputs in my
domain and of course corresponding
outputs because we know that test cases
are an input plus and expected output so
how can we select interesting inputs for
our software so a set of inputs that
after we run them on the software if the
software behaves correctly we'll have
enough confidence that the software is
correctly implemented so one possible
idea is paid vitam we just test them all
which is do exhaustive testing we do all
the inputs nowadays we have powerful
machines we have a lot of computational
power in the cloud we're not just doing
it so to answer that question what I'm
gonna do I'm gonna use another quiz</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
