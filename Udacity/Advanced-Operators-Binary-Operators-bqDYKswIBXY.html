a function called color from hex this
function takes color represented as an
integer specifically a UN 32 are 32-bit
integer now we're going to use
hexadecimal notation because it's easier
to read may have seen colors represented
this way if you've worked in web design
before when a color is represented with
6 hex digits like this pink color here
the first two hex digits represent the
red part of the color so this CC
represents the red part of the color the
next two digits represent the green part
of the color and the last two digits
represent the blue part of the color so
the color from hex function is going to
use the bitwise and operator to isolate
each of these component parts it's going
to isolate the red part the green part
and the blue part that's what's
happening with each of these bitwise and
operators here then with the shift
operator it converts the r g and b
components into a number that's between
0 and 255 finally it divides the RGB
components by 255 so that the number is
fixed between 0 and 1 because that's how
I uicolor is constructed if you had
trouble following that then don't
despair I've included a fun link here to
a video that really captures how red
green and blue values are combined to
create a color and if you look down here
at the bottom where we've called the
function we've actually split out pink
into its red green and blue components
and then we've printed out the colors
that combine to make this pink color</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
