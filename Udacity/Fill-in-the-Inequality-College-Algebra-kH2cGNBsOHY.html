we need a greater than sign let's look
at the two number lines for these two
inequalities let's say that this time I
want to see if the twos are correct in
relation to the ones so I'm going to
draw these number lines from the
perspective of the number ones so I want
to know if 2 is greater than 1 that
means it should fall in the category of
all numbers that are greater than 1
start at one I need to shade to the
right sure enough here's to smack dab in
the middle that range we're not in the
middle but in it and that's all that
matters now we want to know if negative
2 is in fact in the range of numbers
that are less than negative 1 let's go
over to negative 1 and shade to the left
of negative 1 and once again we have
negative 2 as part of that interval
awesome comparing these two number lines
looks like we have pretty much exactly
the same thing so that the intervals
here are reflections of one another
across the zero mark so if I match the
two of them up together on one number
line you can see that we have the exact
same thing to the right of the zero as
we have to the left of the zero just
invert it this is pretty cool so
dividing by negative 1 is just like
flipping everything to the opposite side
of the number line so when we divide it
by negative 1 we flipped our point of
reference across the zero the same
distance away to the other side of the
number line and that's why we had to
switch our sign so that it faces the
opposite direction as well the two
numbers now have the opposite
relationship since being further away
from 0 than another number on the
positive end of the number line means
that your greater than that other number
whereas being further from 0 than
another number on the other end of the
number line the negative side means that
you're less than that other number</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
