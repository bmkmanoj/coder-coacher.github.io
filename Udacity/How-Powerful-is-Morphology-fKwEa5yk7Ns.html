morphology and like most questions in
life the answer is but I always tell my
kids kids it depends if you have nice
clean binary images or even actions it
if your binary images behave exactly the
way the three or four binary images you
looked at when you design the system
we're behaving then things will be fine
so clean might be the wrong word if it's
well here it says almost clean let's
just say that your binary images are
sort of well-behaved so here's an
example and again this comes from Linda
Shapiro all right here is an original
binary image and if I ask you to look at
that quickly and ask you where are the
faults and those gears you would have to
look for it at a long look at it for a
long time but if I show you this picture
and I say where are the faults and the
gears you would say oh I guess there's
one here and there's one there and now
when you look at it you see oh yeah
there really is there's a tooth missing
from from the gears so the question is
how did they do that so again I'm not
going to go into too much of the detail
I'm just gonna show you this set of
images it's all on one page that's the
sequence of operations and I'll just
describe them briefly okay
so here was their original picture that
I showed you
basically over here they were looking
for places that had a ring that would be
essentially black like this white out
here and remember I was telling you
about don't care pixels
you know don't care in there and and of
a particular shape a particular size and
the only pixels that lit up were these
guys okay all right well that's fine and
then you say okay I'm gonna take those
and I'm just gonna dilate them by
something called a hole mask which is
just this basic shape all right so you
realize what you end up with is just the
holes filled up well if I or this Plus
this I get that so wallah I have filled
the holes of my gear okay great
then what I can do is I can essentially
do the same trick again of removing
pixels that basically have with a
structuring element like that so I find
every place where a structuring element
like that fits and that will
out there's these middle parts and then
I can dilate the edge and I end up with
this thing that looks like that great
that's sort of abound around the edge
that's thicker than the edge if I and
these two things so it's an and I get
just the teeth okay that's what's shown
there and and also you'll also notice
we're starting to see there's that gap
right there because that's where the
teeth are missing all right well what I
can do is I can dilate that by something
that has the size of the tip and if I
run that around here I end up filling
everything except where that gap is both
here and there and then given those I
can do in fact the result is just a it's
got the single defect Q that's just this
little round ball basically the
operations exactly is here its b7 right
- b9 here dilated by the defect Q Ord
back with b9 and I get this okay so
would I expect you to implement
something like that I don't know the
point is that with these relatively
simple low-level mathematical operations
you can do a relatively sophisticated
shape analysis if you have the
particular shape that you if you know
the particular shape that you want to
deal with and the particular types of
defect sizes for example you want it to
find so there are other operations that
you can do here's are just a list of
things that you might compute these are
shape descriptors of binary blobs and
like so this used to be a very important
part of computer vision especially in
assembly or machine vision of inspecting
2d parts and for those particular
applications it still is</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
