and now it's time to form a subclass
we've all seen these multiple choice
questions as a question and there are
multiple choices hence the name by the
way if you ever wondered what was the
original name of the java language there
was oak which was a name of there was so
dull and boring that they changed it now
of course one could put this entire text
here into a question class and set the
answer to the string three but that true
would be dull and boring it would be
better to have a class that specifically
deals with multiple choice questions so
that we could declare an object somewhat
like this we make a choice question
that's what I'm calling this class we
still need to set the text of course but
then for the choices I want to be able
to call a method that I call odd choice
it adds a particular choice and then
specifies whether it's false or true
when I formed the choice question class
I don't want to start from scratch
I want to inherit as much as possible
from the question class that's already
written let's see how to do that I'll
define the choice question class and
then I specified that it extends the
question class that's the Java keyword
for denoting that choice question should
become a subclass of question into the
body of the subclass I put in any new
methods that are present in the subclass
but not the superclass such as the add
choice method he also put in the
implementations of any methods that
needed to change in the subclass for
example we'll need to change the display
method since displaying a choice
question must also display the choices
and finally you of course need to add
any instance variables that the choice
question class needs to do its job in
our case that would be the list of the
choices the key point is what you don't
put in here when you define a subclass
you never include any of the methods
from the superclass that worked just
fine for example the set text method
will work fine and we can simply inherit
it from the superclass also you don't
want to include any fields from the
superclass
you get those automatically and if you
were to include them again you'd get
twice which is not good the point is
that what you put inside here is the
difference from the superclass
everything that the subclass has that
the superclass doesn't have at all or
that it doesn't have
in the same way let's have a closer look
at exactly how that works for question
and choice question here is our question
class here is the choice question class
now have a close look and tell me which
methods does the choice question class
inherit just given me the names of all
those methods that choice question
doesn't redefine that it simply picks up
from question which methods as choice
question override that is which methods
this choice question need to redefine
because the ones from question are not
satisfactory and finally which method or
methods does choice question add that
weren't present in the question class in
the first place just give me the names
of the methods altogether there five of
them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
