the 1980s and it gives a way to perform
any function as a secure computation and
the idea is that any discrete fixed size
function can be turned into logic gates
and then if we can find a way to
implement logic gates securely we can
implement a whole function this way so
we can think of a logic gate as a truth
table let's take for example the
function and and takes two inputs and
produces one output and we can describe
that and with the table of values
we'll use 0 to represent false and 1 to
represent true so this is a regular end
gate and if we evaluate the end gate
well we need to know the actual values
of a and B suppose the value of a is 1
and the value of B is 0 then we would
take this line from the the truth table
and know that the output has the value 0
and our goal is to encrypt the circuit
in such a way that we can still evaluate
it without actually knowing what the
inputs are and without learning what the
output is but still produce an output
that we can use as the input to the next
circuit if we can evaluate each gate
this way keeping the inputs and outputs
encrypted we can evaluate the whole
circuit and at the end we can map the
final result to a meaningful value so
our first step to creating an encrypted
circuit is to replace the inputs with
encrypted values that means we need some
way to represent a zero on this wire and
some way to represent a one same for
this wire so we're going to replace
these zeros and ones in the table with
encrypted values we'll just look at
those as Rand manatsu
so we're going to pick some random value
to represent 0 on this wire let's call
that a 0 we'll pick some random value to
represent 1 we'll call that a 1 and
we'll do the same thing for the other
wire and we'll do the same thing for the
output so here's our new truth table
well if we keep things in the same order
we haven't hidden anything so let's
randomly permute it and now suppose we
get a table like this that means that a
0 is either 0 0 1 0 or 1 0 1 0 so now
the question is can you determine what
is the value of B 0 if you could well
that would mean you know the semantic
value of B you can tell if it's equal to
B 0 or not and that would mean you're
evaluating the circuit and you're
learning the values in the circuit so
you don't have the secure computation
you wanted to can you determine the
value of b0
knowing this garbled table</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
