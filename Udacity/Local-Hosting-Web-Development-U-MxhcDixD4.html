questions I've been seeing in the forms
a lot is is hosting this if we people
want to know if you're not using Google
App Engine what else should I do or why
should you use Google App Engine instead
of the alternatives so let's talk about
each of those the first option is to run
your website locally and this basically
means run the sought of a machine that's
in your house or in your dorm room or
it's your everyday computer you know the
same machine you might be developing
which works fine for this class you know
basically the website doesn't have to be
on all the time it just has to be on
while you're submitting your homeworks
and that's it for almost every other use
case it doesn't really make sense some
of the big drawbacks are it's not always
on the internet doesn't go to sleep
neither should your website it's not
always accessible and by that I mean you
know your internet may be broken power
goes down there's lots of you know
you're running in a house it's not a
data center so there's lots of things
that can go wrong your IP may change
depending on your hosting provider you
may need to pay extra for what's called
a static IP and this is an IP that you'd
have to pay extra for so your IP address
basically the location of your machine
on the internet doesn't change because
you want to have you know a name for
your website domain name and that domain
name matches to an IP and if your IP
changes all the time which it does with
most internet connections it won't work
out now there's technologies to work
around this but probably won't have a
static IP</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
