last one that will say extract method is
one of the most commonly used
refactoring as it is applicable in many
many situations the starting point is a
method that is too long and contains
cohesive code fragments that really
serve a single very specific purpose so
we start from a cohesive code fragment
in a large method what we can do in this
case is to create a method using that
code fragment and then replacing the
code fragment with a call to that method
let's look at this with an example here
I have this method called print owing
and what it does imagine that it does a
lot of operations here that I'm just not
listening and then it's got a set of
print statements that are just printing
a lot of details about the owen
information and then again a lot of code
after that so what i could do in this
case to simplify the method is to
transform this set of statements their
cohesive in the sense that they do just
one thing they just print these details
into a method and then I replace the
statements with a call to that method
which is actually something similar to
what we did as part of some of the
previous refactorings here I'm showing
the result so here is the matter that I
extracted as you can see it contains the
code that was previously here I give it
a meaningful name I call it print
details so it's clear what it does and
now the print Owen method is simpler
because I still have the remaining code
they want they didn't touch but now this
potentially long list of details of
prints of details is now replaced by a
single method call so again similar to
the previous refactorings that we saw if
we just look at the print owen method
it's very easy to figure out what this
part does oh it print some details and
once more I really want to stress this
if you don't care about how this is
implemented and knowing that these print
some details is enough then you're done
you don't need to understand anything
more it's clear it's self-explanatory
and if you'll need to look at what print
details does you just go and look at
print details and you look at it in
isolation so it's easier to understand
what this does without having to think
at the rest of the code so once more the
goal of refactoring is just to improve
your design make the code more readable
make the code more maintainable and also
keep in mind all of this I can't with
small examples you also always have to
think about the effect that this can
have on larger code bases it can really
improve a lot the understandability and
maintainability of your code so in
general its design</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
