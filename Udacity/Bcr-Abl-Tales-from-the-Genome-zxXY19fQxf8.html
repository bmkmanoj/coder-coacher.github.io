happen and not only can you swap genetic
information actual genes in frame to get
fusion proteins but there are certain
kinds of translocations that are known
to happen on a regular basis a very
famous one that results in something
called the Philadelphia chromosome is
actually a chromosomal translocation
between chromosomes 9 and chromosomes 22
there is a gene on chromosome 22 called
BCR and another gene on chromosome 9
called the ABL or able what happens is
the tip of chromosome 9 here can
actually break off and this end from
here down on chromosome 22 can get
broken off and these pieces get swapped
at this large chunk here gets put at the
end of chromosome 9 so if I highlight
this here it's now down here in this
tiny region able is over here so the
gene able was the edge of the breaking
point and the gene BCR was the edge of
the breaking point and now the able and
BCR genes are right here next to each
other and they produce a fusion protein
called BCR Abel as you can imagine this
fusion protein is abnormal activity and
the result is a form of blood cancer
called chronic myelogenous leukemia or
CML amazingly there's a drug that can
inhibit this unique protein and treat
patients suffering from this chromosomal
aberration science has brought us a long
ways people this is pretty cool</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
