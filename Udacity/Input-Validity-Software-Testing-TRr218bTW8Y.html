previous example is a building a random
test case generator doesn't have to be
very difficult realistically it's
usually a little bit more involved than
one we just saw and a key problem is
generating inputs that are valid or
another way to say that is generating
inputs that are part of the input domain
for the software under test but I want
to do here is look at the entire space
of random inputs and what I mean by
entire space of random inputs is we
haven't ruled anything out so we get is
random ones and zeros and so remember
that request to constructing random
inputs we're going to be feeding those
into some software under test and we're
looking for outputs in the range of the
software under test and let's say for
sake of argument that we're testing a
web browser and so the question we have
to ask ourselves is how much of the
space of totally random ones and zeros
constitutes a valid input for a web
browser and let's say that we're testing
the rendering engine part of the web
browser so we're testing what happens
when data comes over the web to the web
browser in response to an HTTP request
now the web browser wants to render that
so we have totally random ones and zeros
and as you might expect almost all
arbitrary combinations of ones and zeros
fail to create valid web pages is going
to be some small subset of the rant of
the set of random inputs it constitutes
valid input to the web browser and if we
take one of these other inputs and hand
it to the web browser it's going to be
mapped to a part of the output space the
corresponds to a corresponds to
malformed HTML and one thing we might
ask is isn't that a good thing to test
web browsers with completely invalid
inputs to see if for example instead of
returning a page error it's easily
possible that some subset of this space
corresponds to browser crashes so the
answer is yes we definitely do want to
test our web browser with completely
random inputs but on the other hand the
amount of code in the web browser that
serves to classify codes as renderable
versus not renderable it's some very
tiny fraction of the total amount of
code in the web browser and if the
fraction of valid HTML is very low we're
going to spend almost all of our time
testing this very small part of the web
browser so we probably want to do is
take some tests from this broader set of
completely random inputs but take most
of our tests from the set of valid
webpages so these are the ones which
when we select a random input in here
are going to with some probability end
up exposing something like cross-site
scripting bugs here i'm just getting nor
little details like the fact that we
probably need to be generating
javascript as well in order to make
these kind of bugs
we're just sort of we're mostly trying
to look at the abstract problem here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
