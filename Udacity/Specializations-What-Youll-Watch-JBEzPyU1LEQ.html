I mentioned many fields have already
been addressed by machine learning which
means there's actually already articles
and ideas out there that you can build
off of and in fact there are certain
areas where machine learning has already
been used so much that there are even
classes on how to use machine learning
in those domains some of those are
hosted here we already have classes
through the Georgia Tech program on
applying machine learning to healthcare
or trading and so here in Sidon those
domains you're welcome to use those
materials to kind of get up to speed on
how much team learning is being used in
those areas on the other hand there are
also materials on other websites that
can get you up to speed on how to use
machine learning in other domains as
well or maybe you want to choose one
that's actually just never been
addressed before in which case great
we'd love to see what you come up with
so you're not completely alone in this
portion but we really want you to define
a project that's going to be interesting
to you and it's going to generate a
portfolio item for you that you'll be
proud to brag about</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
