debugging returns isn't only a
simplified set but it's also a cause for
the failure what is a cause anyway
assume I have a window and here comes a
ball flying through the window and the
window breaks you would think straight
forward that the ball is the cause for
the window to break but why is it a
cause this is so called counterfactual
definition of causality which is the
most useful in our context works as
follows we have two events a and B and a
comes before B say a is the ball flying
towards the window and B is the window
shattering we now say that a causes B if
B had not occurred if a had not occurred
apply to our example we can say that the
ball causes the window to shatter if the
window had not shattered if the ball had
not arrived which actually is true with
the ball the window shatters without the
ball the window does not chatter and
since the ball precedes the shattering
everything is in place to say that the
ball caused the window to shatter if
this sounds complicated you haven't seen
much yet causality is one of the most
disputed subjects in philosophy some
philosophers even saying that causality
does not really exist it's just illusion
for our purposes however that is within
debugging this counterfactual definition
does a good job first we have the ball
then we have the window crashing or
first we have the defect and then we
have the failure so why does delta
debugging return a cause or simply
because there might be a large set of
events that are could or could not
contribute to the failure the sun is
shining clouds are in the sky there's a
nice green lawn and whatever else but
none of this is relevant for shattering
the window only the ball is and by
simplifying this scenery towards the
single element that is responsible for
the test to fail delta debugging returns
a cause</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
