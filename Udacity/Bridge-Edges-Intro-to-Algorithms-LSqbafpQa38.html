in this unit and again it's related to
the analysis of graphs and paths and
using variants of depth-first and
breadth-first search to answer questions
about the graph here's a little graph
that I drew and one thing that we might
notice is that you know everybody's
connected everybody else but there is
this sort of weak edge this is the
weakest link
hello if this edge were to be removed
from the graph like so the number of
components in the graph has just gone up
by one now that was the only edge in
this graph that has that property
there's other edges that if we take them
out things are still connected so in
some social networks it's useful to know
are there any edges in this graph are
there any pairs of people in the graph
that are connected that if they were to
say stop being friends there would be
disconnection in the network as a whole
so let's put this edge back in and label
the edges or sorry leave label the nodes
of the graph so we can talk about them
and we're gonna carry on an algorithm
that goes back to 1974 by Robert Arjen
Tarjan is responsible for some of the
most amazing graph algorithms a lot of
which are based on the ideas of building
trees spanning trees using depth-first
and breadth-first search back in college
my friend chris m and i used to refer to
him as Tarjan lord of the trees so the
basic idea of this algorithm is we pick
any node in the graph let's say B and we
start to build a tree starting from B
and here's how we do it starting for B
we look at all the neighbors of B which
in this case are a and C and we haven't
built any of them into the graph yet so
we can add them into the graph and now
we do essentially search just as we were
doing before we have visited a and C so
from a we look at the neighbors of a and
the neighbors of a or B and C now the BA
edge is already in there but the BC edge
is not okay so we're going to add a
special kind of edge because this is an
edge between two nodes that are already
existing we'll call this a non-tree edge
because what we're going to do is we're
going to take this entire graph and
express it essentially as a as a tree
but some of the edges aren't going to be
part of the tree we're gonna have to add
them in separately alright so that takes
care of all the neighbors of B the
neighbors of C we have B which is the
edges already in there and we also have
an edge to e which we haven't seen yet
so
add that edge in and then we proceed
from E now he has three edges back to C
which we already have and also to D and
G and those are new new nodes so we
build them in with tree edges and we
continue our search now let's say from D
D has tuna two neighbors E and F he's
already in there but we can add in F as
a tree edge we look back at G G has
neighbors F and E the e1 is in there the
f1 is not so we add that non-tree edge
in there because F is already in the
diagram but that edge was not and then
from F there's connections to D and G
and those are already in the graph so
basically what we've done now is we
rewrote the original graph as a rooted
tree so starting with some node and then
proceeding downward and then any edges
that don't really fit that pattern we
put in as little red dotted lines so
we've rewritten the graph as a tree and
the next thing we need to do is post
order the nodes now post ordering is
something you can do to any tree
structure and it basically involves
assigning a number sequential number to
each of the nodes in the in the tree and
post order means that what we do is to
assign a number to a node we first make
sure that all the children on its left
are numbered all the children on its
right or numbered children and
descendants direct children also their
children's children and then the node
itself gets a number after that so B's
number is going to come from first
numbering a well a has and then and then
everything below C and then we can
number be itself a x' number comes from
neighboring numbering it's children
which it doesn't have any so it can get
that whatever the next number is which
in this case is one all right so back to
B we have to label all that all the
children on its left all the children on
its right
but we haven't done that yet so let's do
a numbering starting from C well see
before it gets a number it has to have
all its children numbered and we can see
that they don't have numbers yet so we
have to proceed down the tree he needs a
number well he can't get its number
until it's children have been numbered
but there haven't been numbered yet so
let's number those d-do you should get a
number but first its children have to
get a number this is a you know children
first sort of scheme DS children
is has one child and that's f4f to get a
number it's children oh it doesn't have
any children yet alright so f can get
the next available number in this case
it's two so now that that's finished d
can get a number because all its
children are numbered so D gets the next
available number that's three II know II
still can't be numbered because it's
children haven't been all numbered yet
we have to go to G first G has no
children so it can get the next
available number now he can get a number
post order in this case is post meeting
after after all the kids the note itself
can get numbered
there's also pre-order and inorder but
we're just looking at post order for
this algorithm all right now see all its
children have been numbered so now C can
get its number B all its children have
been numbered so now B can get its
number so we've now post ordered all the
nodes in the graph so just to make sure
that you're understanding that process
here's a different tree this time the
branching factor is a little bit
different in some places and I want you
to post order this tree and then type in
this box the number assigned to node P
once you've done that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
