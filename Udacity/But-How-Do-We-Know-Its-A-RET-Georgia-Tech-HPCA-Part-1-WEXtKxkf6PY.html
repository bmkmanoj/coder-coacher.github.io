it's our hat instruction remember we
need to make our prediction while we are
fetching the instruction so if this is a
return instruction we need to use the
return address stack before we even
determine that it is a return
instruction we cannot just keep pushing
and popping things from the return
address stack before we know it's a
return because for example if there is
an ad and we pop from the return address
stack then it's not going to work
correctly we actually need to figure out
or at least very accurately predict
what's our return instructions so that
we can use the rassa appropriately so
the problem is that we are using the
write while fetching the instruction
it's not been decoded yet so we don't
know it's a return instruction yet so
how do we do it one way is to just use a
very simple predictor that will be
trained on whether the instruction we
are fetching is a rat or not simply
train the predictor one way or the other
depending on whether it's a rat or not
and then make that predictor tell us
whether to use the return address stack
or not this would be a very accurate
predictor if at a particular PC we have
seen a read instruction previously then
it is very likely that if we see the
same PC we still have a return
instruction so we can use a single bit
predictor very easily here another
approach is to use a so called
pre decoding we will soon see that the
processor really contains a cache that
stores instructions that have been
fetched from memory and it's fetching
instructions from the cache and only if
the cache doesn't already contain the
instruction it goes through memory so
the pre decoding works by when I'm
fetching from memory i decode enough of
the instruction to know that it's a
return or not and I store that
information along with the actual
instruction in the cache so pretty much
my memory will for example have 32-bit
instructions in my cache I will store 33
bits per instruction 32 bits of the
actual instruction and one bit that
tells me whether the instruction is a
return or not so the idea is that as the
instruction is coming from memory
and we put it to cash we can be pretty
coding instructions keeping some
additional bits in the cache about a
pretty coating of the instruction so
that when we fetch we already know that
information the alternative to this
would have been to just fetch the
instructions from memory to cache as
they are and then every time we fetch we
have to figure out what this instruction
is because it's also more power
efficient to do this once and then fetch
instruction many times rather than redo
it every single time
3d coding is a very popular approach so
pretty coding is used for things like is
it a written instruction is it a branch
instruction at all if we know it's not a
branch then we can completely omit the
use of any branch vectors thus saving a
lot of power if our instructions are of
variable size is pretty coding can also
tell us for example how many bytes this
instruction is long so that we can fetch
the next instruction quickly and not
rely on just decoding the instruction
before we can fetch the next one and so
on so there is a lot of things that
modern processors do in this pre
decoding phase in order to avoid doing
it when we are on the clock after we
have fetch the instruction</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
