course thank you for taking the time and
effort to do so we hope you've
appreciated taking this class as much as
we have creating it and we want to give
a special thanks to everyone who made
this possible from our guest experts to
our team here at Udacity with the
special thanks to Calvin and kagura who
helped us produce this course now that
we've come to a close in the course we
hope you can fully appreciate
understanding psychology that is human
thought and behavior both scientifically
and clinically and about sometimes how
these processes can go wrong but if they
do there are treatment options to help
people that's right and we also hope you
appreciate the complexity of our brains
as well as knowing that we need a
healthy brain to function successfully
in our world in addition we hope that
you appreciate the environment in how
that shapes our behavior and how it's
really a combination of both nature and
nurture that makes you you and because
we're dedicated to making this the very
best course we can make it we hope that
you can give us feedback on the
synonymous survey to tell us what you
liked what you loved and what you
thought needed improvement and even
though you're done check back in from
time to time because we're going to add
new material and you can further your
knowledge on psychology</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
