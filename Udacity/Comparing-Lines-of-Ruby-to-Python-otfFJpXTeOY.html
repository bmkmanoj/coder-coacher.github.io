I've been kind of struggling to figure
out how to write out the back end for my
code and like my friend Walter told me
that I should use Ruby for it but I
don't know Ruby and the syntax is weird
and I don't know what I'm doing and
let's just take a step back and realize
that you've come a long way you're in
your strain zone right now but that's
okay so just tell me a little bit about
what you're doing so I'm trying to build
out a class for a database so that I can
store images okay so you've learned
about classes in Python right yeah okay
let's just split project compass aside
for a minute and look at an example of a
class right so here's a class in Python
for a car object can you explain that to
me
yeah so it's got a couple of attributes
you're making model I see you like down
here we have this new car that's a new
car object with some of these attributes
defined okay great so let's look at what
this looks like in Ruby so as you can
see there are a couple of differences in
Python you have to declare self but in
Ruby you don't have to do that also when
you create a new instance of a variable
you actually need the keyword new but in
Python you don't but other than that
that logic is pretty much the same okay
I see how they're similar how can I
learn more about these syntax
differences so you can check out the
Ruby documentation online or you can
check out online forums because there's
a huge community to help new programmers
in addition check out the Udacity forum
so I'll be really helpful to you
okay oh I'll give it another shot thanks
Georgia you can do it Anthony I believe
in you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
