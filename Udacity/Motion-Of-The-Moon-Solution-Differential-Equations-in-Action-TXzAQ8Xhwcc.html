lengths which means that the unit of
measurement that the cosine returns is 1
the cosine does not return meters or
kilograms it returns bare numbers so
whatever is in front of that cosine
determines the measurement unit of the
result the result is not measured in
days if we can immediately reject these
the result is measured in meters it can
only be this one or that one the cosine
and the sine range between minus 1 and
plus 1 if we multiply by something times
10 to the minus 9 meters we would be
dealing with very very tiny lengths
that's not what we are into here it has
to be the first form this is the radius
of the orbit of the moon around the
earth let me do this in reverse order
the radius of the orbit of the moon
should not appear inside here this has
to do with a period of the moon's orbit
how long does it take the moon to make
one full orbit around Earth 27 days it
must not be the meters which is also
clear from the unit's if we have meters
in here
something has to cancel the meters we
have to have an angle in here if we
speak of radians again something without
measurement units there must not be any
measurement unit in here if it were
meters these meters would have to cancel
somehow how would I do that
not with time obviously seconds or taste
on cancer with meters once we hear it's
clear that we have to use the division
days divided by days this gets rid of
the measurement unit we can't multiply
by days otherwise we would be getting
days square and the remaining choice 2pi
times the time not this one not this one
if we let T grow by 27 days one complete
period the numerator increases by 2pi
times 27 days
and this ratio increases by 2/5 times 27
days divided by 27 days by 2 pi st
advances by 1 period this ratio advances
by 2 pi but that's precisely what we
need for cosine and sine the angle has
to advance by 2 pi 360 degrees one full
revolution</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
