to shortest tour or how do you general
go about showing NP completeness when
the two problems that you have are not
related to each other so let's briefly
just restate what the sad problem is and
the shortest to problem and then let's
try to relate the two to each other so
sat was a problem where you were given
as input a boolean formula and the
output or question was does the formula
have a satisfying assignment and of
course that is a yes or no question
because we're dealing with a decision
problem here and shortest or that's easy
to remember because we talked about it a
lot so far in this course the input was
a graph with distances and we said we
need a number D in order to make this a
decision problem and the question here
was is there a tour of length at most D
and bite or we mean that we want to
visit all vertices at least once but we
can visit them more than once so now
comes the creative part how on earth are
we going to take a boolean formula and
turn this into a problem related to mail
delivery and it's not obvious so what I
always find useful to do in these cases
is to just write down all the properties
that a boolean formula has that a
satisfying assignment has so anything I
can I can think of for sad and then
write down properties of the shortest
tour problem and see if I can find a
certain relationship between them
because oftentimes that will give me an
idea of how to accomplish a reduction
like this so let's see properties of sad
the first one is each variable is set to
either true or false but not both so
it's either true or false and these are
all trivial properties but let's see if
they help us and actually deciding
whether a variable should be true or
false is what makes this problem hard so
i can also write that down so deciding
this true or false for each variable is
what makes SAT hard then what you will
also remember is that when we talk about
a boolean formula then we can write it
in conjunctive normal form which is this
form here where we have a bunch of
variables that are combined by an or
then brackets around that
then comes an end and then comes again a
series of oars and then comes an end and
so on and this part here we learned in
the last unit was called a clause so
first of all if there is a satisfying
assignment each clause must be satisfied
so how do you satisfy clause well since
in a clause as you remember we just have
wars between the variables this means
that one single variable if it's set in
the right way so either to true or to
false if if we have a very well whether
or not then setting one single variable
the right way is enough to satisfy that
clause and so we should probably also
write that down one variable is enough
to satisfy a clause let's see if we can
do the same thing for shortest tour so
what are some properties of a shortest
tour well first of all every city must
be visited at least once because
otherwise it's not a valid tour the main
decision we need to make is of course in
which order we visit the city so and
once we have visited a city we can visit
it again but we don't have to and the
final thing is we don't visit a city
more than once on purpose so at a
certain point of time we might want to
visit a city once more because it's
beneficial but in the shortest tour we
wouldn't visit a city more than once
unless it's necessary so I'm going to
phrase this as we don't visit a city
more than once on purpose now you might
be wondering why I have left the
numberings here blank and that is
because we're now going to have a little
quiz here because what I would like you
to think about is here we have four
different properties of SAT and here we
have four different properties of
shortest tour I would like you to find
out which properties of shortest tour
are most closely related to these
properties here of SAT so this is a bit
tricky and subjective but I think it's
very valuable to learn the style of
thinking so before you hit next out of
frustration please at least spend a
little bit of time trying to figure this
out and then enter here the number that
you think most closely corresponds over
here so if I were to say that deciding
true or false is what makes sad heart is
a close analogy to every city visited at
least once I would enter a 2 here but
this is actually not a correct answer
and also I've structured it so that each
number here will only appear once so how
are these two related</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
