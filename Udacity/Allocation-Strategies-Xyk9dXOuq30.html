allocating space on mass storage devices
to a file just like caches work in terms
of units of cache lines or cache blocks
and virtual memory works in terms of
pages file systems work in terms of
blocks also sometimes called clusters in
the case of a disk a block address would
need to identify the physical location
there are different vocabularies here
will refer to platter tract and most
specifically sector the block address
identifies the starting sector and the
block itself might cover several more
sectors all blocks are of the same size
there are several strategies for keeping
track of which blocks are free and which
are used one easy way is to keep a list
of free blocks another is to use a bit
vector where each bit indicates whether
a block is free or not there are more
complex strategies as well which is more
appropriate will depend on the
strategies for assigning new blocks to a
file as it grows we won't go into those
details here instead we'll focus on how
a file system keeps track of which
blocks belong to which files and of the
ordering of these blocks within the file
ideally we would want a file system that
allows for simple and fast creation and
deletion of files the simplicity here
will help maintain consistency in the
face of crashes we want flexibility on
size that as we want to be able to
handle file size as large as well as
small and of course we want an efficient
use of disk space and we want fast
access sequential refers to reading a
file in sequence from start to finish
and random access refers to jumping
around in the file specifically we'll
look at the file allocation table
strategy which was widely used in the
DOS era and is still used on many USB
devices and we'll also look at the
extended file format which is the
longtime linux standard</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
