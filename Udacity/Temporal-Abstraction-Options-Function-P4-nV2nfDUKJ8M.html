literature about semi Markov decision
processes as well beyond the sort of
scope of this lesson but from our point
of view what's really neat about this
and this comes up again and again when
you use smtp is that once we define an
smtp and the appropriate bellman
operator for it we can basically just
pretend that it's an MVP because at
bottom it is in MTP and these
expectations allow us to ground out in
that MVP and so we can just pretend
we're always dealing with an MVP and we
only have to deal with the fact that
it's an smtp it just works i take an
option is just an action it just takes
time and is an atomic but whatever i
might as well treat them as if they're
atomic I just let it run and it comes
back and when it comes back it will have
accumulated for me all the reward that I
would accumulate if I were living in the
underlying MVP and it will discount the
future in exactly the right way after
I've taken K steps whoo yes exactly so
this is a lot of a sort of equation
writing and deltas and Delta raised to
powers and expectations that allows us
to say you know what we're still dealing
with MVPs with options everything we
knew before works okay that's that's a
relief i guess that we didn't have to
throw all that out and start a fresh
yeah and and again i mean it's actually
important this is I you know for me as
this seemed like a subtle point for a
long time but it's actually not that
subtle it's just an SMTP is just an MVP
and where we have to keep track of the
fact that our actions are not atomic and
accumulate reward and accumulate all the
transitions but really that's all
captured very nicely by this expectation
it just means we have to hide things
like the discount factors inside of our
functions whereas before with the MDP we
could stick them outside of the
transition function okay well then and
it I'm not quite getting the name I
think semi Markov decision process
sounds like it's you know kind of mark
off but also kind of not mark off yeah
that's right it's semi Markov but but
this seems Markov right i mean under
underneath it's just a whole bunch of
standard MVP type transitions yeah this
is effing right but what's what's
allowing it but at the level of the
options right it's not mark off because
you have to know how much time has
passed
I see I see so we're right the state
that we end up in could actually depend
on how much time we've spent how much
time is elapsed in fact it will in
general right because if I do it in one
step I'm going to end up in some state I
can't reach the states that are more
than one step away if I take 10 steps
then I can reach more states so the
state I end up in does depend upon K
depends upon how long the option was
executed and in general since beta is a
probability over States it could happen
at any time I see so it's got elements
of Mark often elements of not Markov so
elements of Markov include things like
well we can think about the probability
distribution over where we're going to
end up it really is Markov but we have
to be much more careful when we actually
some up rewards because the time that
has elapsed is variable and so we have
to actually take into consideration how
many steps have passed to do that right
and how do we normal and in fact that's
a very important point and I'll sort of
point out two things here one is when we
have a process that is not Markovian
often we can turn into in fact we can
turn basically any non-markovian process
into a Markovian process by just keeping
track of enough history right and
history is often time is enough
sometimes you actually want to know what
States you visited but oftentimes enough
and so we can turn a non-markovian thing
into a Markovian thing and in some ways
that's what we're doing here right we
are keeping track of this the places
that we saw in between but at the level
of the smtp at the level of the options
i can ignore the MVP and pretend that
the smtp is an MVP and that these are
really atomic action but in reality they
aren't which is why r &amp;amp; F actually
depend upon K it actually matters how
many steps you took and that expects
that affects the expectation and in fact
if you look at our I am actually
accumulating all the rewards so I am
taking something that's non-markovian
because it depends upon the actual
rewards that I see which depends upon
the actual states that i visited and I'm
gathering them with me as I go along so
that when i pop out a level it goes back
to looking Markovian go cool right so an
S NDP it's an MVP
and I don't add to think about anymore I
feel like I'm getting the the kind of
math of this but it's still it's still a
bit of an abstraction to me is it can we
get into some kind of an example to
practice these ideas so yes first I want
to point out that I appreciate the pun
using the word abstraction or eggs it
like that but I think the answer is both
yes or no I'm going to go through an
example that I think might help you
think a little bit about this but I also
think that actually working out all
these expectations would take us a long
time and it's a really good and useful
exercise which is why it should probably
be an exercise well let the students do
it I mean I don't know it seems like a
cool exercise in dynamic programming and
algorithm designed but Michael you think
everything is a cool exercise in dynamic
programming well that may be but that's
because everything is a cool exercise in
dynamic programming yes that's an
excellent point and why we're going to
move on to the next slide</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
