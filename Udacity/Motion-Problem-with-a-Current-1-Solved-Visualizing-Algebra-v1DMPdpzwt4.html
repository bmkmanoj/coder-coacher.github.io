great algebra solving if you found that
answer we know the lowest common
denominator for this equation would be X
minus 5 times X plus 5 so we multiply
our equation through by the LCD these
binomials cancel with one another
leaving us with this equation here on
the right-hand side I recognize that
this was the difference of squares
pattern so I just have x squared minus
25 a squared minus B squared next we
distribute to get this equation now we
just want to combine like terms 10x plus
15x equals 25 x and positive 50-75
equals negative 25 next we add 25 to
both sides or just remove the negative
25 since it's balanced on each side of
the equation this leaves us with 25 x
equal to x squared we have a quadratic
equation so we're going to move this
term to the other side with a positive x
squared term this allows us to set our
equation equal to zero now we're going
to position to factor this quadratic
I've rewritten it here and then I
factored an X out of each of these terms
so all of X times X minus 25 now we set
each factor equal to 0 leaving us with x
equals 0 or x equals 25 so there are
actually two possible values for x 25 or
0 but since the boat is actually moving
we know it can't be 0 therefore the boat
must move at 25 miles per hour and
