visualize data sets with histograms in
order to analyze the shape we want to
analyze the shape so that we can think
critically about the mean median and
mode to describe the data set in a
skewed distribution the mean median and
mode differ from each other and the
median might be more useful than the
mean in a lot of ways in a normal
distribution the mean median and mode
are approximately equal what else is
important about knowing the shape of a
distribution let's explore this question
with a story
I've played just my whole life I learned
when I was four and started competing in
tournaments when I was seven there are
three things I could tell you about my
chess abilities the first is my rating
in chess which all competitive players
have my ratings 1800 another thing I
could tell you is that among competitive
American chess players I come in eight
thousand one hundred tenth place this is
based on rating and the third is that I
rank higher than eighty eight percent of
American competitive chess players which
one of these gives you the best sense of
how good I am at chess for most of you
you won't know what a rating is but if
you do pretend like you don't and you're
hearing this term for the first time so
for the purposes of this quiz if you
knew nothing about chess what would be
the best metric to tell you how good I
am</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
