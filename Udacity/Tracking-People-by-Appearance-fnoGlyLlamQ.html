and this comes from some work of
tracking people particular their limbs
and stuff by learning their appearance
and the ideas they build a person model
and the person model is made up of a
couple of different things it's made up
of an appearance will talk about what
that is in a minute plus structure plus
dynamics all right now the structure and
dynamics are generic that is they are
the links of my body the dynamics that
are how they can move so you know what
are the speeds people tend to move and
some of the process noise but the
appearance is person specific ok so the
idea is I'm going to learn the
appearance and then I'm going to do the
tracking and that's represented in this
picture here alright so the idea is
given some input examples we build the
model and the model is like I said it's
generic structure but we might learn the
colors and you know the textures of
these different parts and then using
that appearance and the structure we can
do the detection running on the on the
new frames here's the reference Robin on
for size and the sermon and this is
showing you them tracking those people
parts and the idea is that they use a
pearance that's all I want to talk about
that specific method a bit later
actually towards the end of this course
we're going to describe some recognition
methods that use a lower dimensional
space for doing recognition we've
mentioned piece principal component
analysis etc once we do that we can talk
about a couple more one or two more
tracking examples that use a pca based
description as their appearance model
but until we have that it would be
premature to talk about</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
