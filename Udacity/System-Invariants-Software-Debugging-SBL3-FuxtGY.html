situations where you want to ensure that
some property holds throughout the
entire execution let me give you an
example for that suppose you have a very
big Python program with dozens or even
hundreds of modules and suppose that due
to some design decision there's one
global variable called flag which is
accessible from all these modules and
all of these modules could possibly
change the value of flag the red flag
there right into flag but now you have a
run in which flag should not be sent and
yet it is set and you have all these
places in the program where the variable
could be said but you don't know where
this is what you want to have in this
situation is a check that is executed at
every moment throughout the execution of
the program and which monitors the
moment in which flag is set to true from
a previous unit you may remember the
tracing functionality in Python by using
the set trace function you can specify a
function here trace it that it will be
executed after every single line is
executed in your program and we can set
up this trace each function such that
after every line it checks the status of
the global variable flag and a boars
execution as soon as flag becomes true
as any such tracing function it returns
itself such that it will be executed
with the next slide as soon as you have
such as checker in place the flag will
be checked after every single line of
execution and you will be able to
monitor exactly where the flag is set
and this of course is true for arbitrary
data structures if you do have some data
structures a store again which can be
accessed from lots and lots of places
then a call say to store the Czech rep
will ensure that store is consistent for
every single line that's executed just
be sure to turn this off while store is
executing its own methods because while
these internal methods are running store
would naturally violate its own internal
data invariants</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
