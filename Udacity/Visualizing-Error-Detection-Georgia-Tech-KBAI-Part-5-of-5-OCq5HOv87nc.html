the errors may lie in the knowledge in
the reasoning or in the architecture of
an agent and therefore learning by
correcting errors might be applicable to
any one of those however in this lesson
we'll be focusing only on errors in
knowledge in fact in particular we'll be
focusing on errors in classification
knowledge classification of course is a
topic that we have considered this
classic repeatedly let us consider an
air agent that has two examples of
executing an action in the world and if
first experience the agent views this
object as a cup and gets the feedback
this indeed was a cup so this was a
positive experience this on the other
hand is a negative example hey the agent
viewed this as a cup and got the
feedback that this should not have been
viewed as a cup we can visualize the
problem of identifying what knowledge
element let the agent to incorrectly
classified this as a cup as follows this
left circle here consists of all
features that describe the positive
example the circle on the right consists
of all features that describe the
negative example so features in this
left circle might be things like this is
a handle there is a question mark there
is a blue interior and so on the circle
and the right consists of features that
characterize a negative example it is a
movable handle it is a red interior it
has red and white markings on the
outside there are some features that
characterize only the positive
experience and not the negative
experience the others that characterize
only the negative experience and not the
positive experience they're also many
features characterized both deposit with
a negative example for example they both
concave they both have handles and so on
in this example it is these features
that are specially important will call
them false suspicious features we call
them false suspicious features because
first they identify only the negative
experience secondly one or more of these
features may be responsible for the fact
that the agent classified this as a
positive example when in fact was a
negative
example as an example suppose that this
feature corresponds to a movable handle
this is a false suspicious feature it is
false because this experience was false
it is suspicious because it does not
characterize the positive experience and
thus it may be one of the features
responsible for the fact that this was a
negative example but now there is an
additional problem there are a number of
false suspicious features here so how
would the agent decide which false
suspicious feature to focus on we have
encountered this problem earlier when we
were talking about incremental concept
learning at that point we had said that
we want to give examples in an order
such that each succeeding example
differs from the current concept
definition in exactly one feature so the
agent knows exactly what to focus
attention on the same kind of problem
occurs again how might the agent know
which feature to focus on one
possibility is that it could cry one of
the featured at a time and see whether
it will work that is it could select
this feature to repeat the process get
more feedback and either as accepted or
eliminated and alternative method is
that the agent may receive not just two
experiences but many such experiences so
there were other positive experiences
that covered this part of the circle
that would leave only this as a false
suspicious feature and then the agent
kit focuses attention on this feature as
an example just like this circle may
correspond to movable handle this may
correspond to red interior because red
included is one of the features that
characterizes a negative example and not
a positive example well later on there
might be another positive example that
comes up a cup which had a written
cheater in which case the agent can
exclude this particular feature and the
inverse of this situation is also
possible let us suppose that the agent
decides that this is not a cup perhaps
because this definition says there's
something with a blue interior it is not
a cup and therefore it doesn't bring
water to you inside this Cup and tells
you there is no cop available in the
kitchen you go to the kitchen you see it
and you say well this is the cup now the
agent must learn why did you decide the
this was not a cup in this case the
relevant features are these three
features these are the three features
that define this cup but do not define
the other experiences so this dot may
correspond to a blue in cheater this
document correspond to a question mark
on the exterior will call this features
true suspicious just like we call them
false species these are the features
that prevented the agent from deciding
this was a positive example of a cup one
or more of these features may be
responsible for the agents failure to
recognize that this was a</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
