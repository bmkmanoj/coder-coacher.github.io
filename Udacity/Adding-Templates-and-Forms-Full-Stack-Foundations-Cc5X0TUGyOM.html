and replace those strings in your return
statements with templates in your
templates directory make eight new files
with the following names replace the
previous return statements such that
they now return render templates for
each of your methods in final project PI
but wait a second if we design our
templates before connecting to a
database Python will throw an error
message when we try to refer to
restaurants and menu items that don't
yet exist in our application to get
around this problem we can temporarily
make a fake database out of dictionaries
inside of our final project PI file I
have made some dictionaries which will
serve as dummy variables for one
restaurant a collection of restaurants
one menu item and a collection of menu
items the source code for these
dictionaries is available in the
instructor notes go ahead and leave
hashtags in the forum action and href
paths since we are focusing more on the
structure of our pages in this step and
not so much their functionality now when
a user revisits these links in a browser
they should see something like this the
functionality isn't going to be in place
just yet we've just created another
prototype that we can use to present our
progress thus far your template should
also return a different message to the
user if there's an empty menu or empty
list of restaurants maybe something like
this try and see if you can accommodate
for this corner case in your templates
as well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
