viruses and internet worms let's first
define what a viruses and then define
what a worm is a virus is effectively an
infection of an existing program that
results in the modification of the
original programs behavior a worm is
code that propagates and replicates
itself across the network a worm is
usually spread by exploiting flaws in
existing programs or open services
whereas viruses typically require user
action to spread for example opening an
attachment on an email or running an
executable file that a friend gave you
on a USB key worms propagate
automatically we will focus most of our
attention on internet worms but before
we dive into the details of Internet
worms let's first talk about the
different types of viruses a parasitic
virus typically infects an existing
executable file a memory resident virus
infects running programs a boot sector
virus spreads whenever the system is
booted a polymorphic virus encrypts part
of the virus program using a randomly
generated key so one of the key
differences between viruses and worms is
that viruses typically spread with
manual user intervention worms typically
spread automatically by scanning for
vulnerabilities and infecting vulnerable
hosts when those vulnerabilities are
discovered a worm might use any of these
techniques to infect a particular host
before spreading further in the rest of
the lesson we will first talk about a
brief history of Internet worms
including the first internet worm called
the Morris worm and other famous
internet worms from the early days of
internet worms in the early 2000s
including Code Red and other well-known
internet worms of the time well then
talk about how to model the spread
of a worm in terms of scanning and
infection rates using analogies from
epidemiology finally we'll talk about
design techniques for designing super
fast spreading worms and we'll look at
an example of a super fast spreading
worm</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
