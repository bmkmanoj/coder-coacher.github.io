squared minus 36 x plus 37 great solving
if you got all three of these correct
now if you only got one or two of these
right that's okay too these are not the
easiest problems and I'm sure you'll get
out with more practice to find f of G of
1 we first need to find the G of 1 so
when one is the input 4G we should get
an output of negative 2 we get that
simply by letting X equal positive 1 so
now that we know G of 1 equals negative
2 we just need to find f of negative 2
we use negative 2 as the input for F if
we let X equal negative 2 for this
function here and here then we can see
that will get a total sum of 10 negative
2 squared is positive 4 negative 2 times
negative 2 is positive for which makes 8
plus another 2 equals 10 this is how we
solve the first problem and we can use
the same approach to tackle this problem
F of G of 2 letting the x value equal to
here we get a G of 2 equal to 1 so we
know that the output of G is 1 when x
equals 2 so it can replace this G of 2
with the value 1 now we just need to
find f of 1 i'm letting the output of G
when x equals 2 now be the input for F
negative 2 and positive 2 some 20 so
then I just have one squared which
equals positive 1 now we've done it two
calculations for F of G but it would be
so much nicer and easier if we just had
one function to work with an F of G of X
function so to find this function we
simply take G of X and we plug it in
anywhere we see an X and F so notice
that here and here I've left spots for
the X we have something squared minus
two times something plus two we're going
to take G of X which is three X minus 5
and use that as our input this is how we
find the composition F of G of X we have
X as a variable
and we're finding the output a plug it
in G of X into this function squaring
this binomial we get 9x squared minus
30x plus 25 then we'll distribute this
negative 2 to get negative 6x plus 10
and a positive 2 on the end there's no
like terms with 9x squared so I'll just
list that here then we'll combine the
like terms of negative 30x and negative
6x to get negative 36 X and finally
we'll add 25 10 and 2 to get positive 37
this is how we get our entire composite
function</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
