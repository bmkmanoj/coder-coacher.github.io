definitions this notion of aversion
space turns out to be really important
in understanding how to analyze these
algorithms so imagine we've got some
hypothesis space H capital H and a true
hypothesis that we're trying to learn C
of H it's also sometimes called a
concept and we're trying to learn from a
training set s which is a subset of the
possible inputs and what our training
set consists of is those examples along
with the true class for all those X's so
at any given time a learner might have
some candidate hypothesis little H in
big H and a learner that produces a
candidate hypothesis little H such that
C of X is equal to H of X for all X in
the training set is called a consistent
learner right so so what would be what
would be another way of describing what
a consistent learner is a consistent
learner can actually learn the
hypothesis or the true concept well it
produces right I mean of all the
possible things that could return it
returns the one that matches the data
that it seen so far right so it's
consistent with the data that makes
sense yeah and the version space is
essentially the space of all the
hypotheses that are like that that are
consistent with the data so we'll say
the version space for a given set of
data s is going to be the set of
hypotheses that are in the hypothesis
set such that they're consistent with
respect to the samples that they're
given ok they make sense all right good
so I think what we'll do next is a quiz
just to make sure that we kind of get
this concept and how it works and we'll
do that next time okay sure I like
quizzes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
