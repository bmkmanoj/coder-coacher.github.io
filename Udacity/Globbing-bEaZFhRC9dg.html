of files that have similar names you can
use a glob of pattern to do it I am NOT
making up this name globbing is the real
actual technical term for matching files
by name in the UNIX shell seriously
gloving if you don't believe me you can
look it up man glob-globbing is a kind
of pattern matching for filenames when
you're writing a glob a pattern in a
shell command the shell turns that
pattern into a list of file names that
exist and match the pattern for instance
a star matches any string of characters
you can use a star at the beginning or
at the end of pattern patterns can be of
all sorts of different lengths you can
use two stars in the same pattern
for instance here matching every file
whose name contains P P a star can
appear in the middle of a pattern
matching all the files that start with B
and end with PNG there are other
patterns you can use as well for
instance to match files that end in
either CSS or HTML a list of strings in
curly braces will match any of the
alternatives a single question mark
matches any one character so ve a
question mark PNG matches both bean and
bear but it doesn't match beer or bees
two question marks matches two
characters and so on
list of characters inside square
brackets matches any one of the
characters inside this brackets so be e
and then square brackets AEIOU
are ing well match bear and beer but not
being Orbeez something to watch out for
is that filenames and Linux are always
case sensitive and that applies to
globbing too for instance if you have
files that end in jpg in capitals and
files that end in jpg in lowercase you
have to specify which one you want if
you want both you could use the curly
braces</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
