of how GMs is implemented how it is
architected let's first understand at
the high level what's going on in terms
of page fault handling now that we have
this community service underlying GMS in
this picture I'm showing you two hosts
host P and host Q and you can see that
the physical memory on this host is
divided into the local part of the
global part
similarly the physical memory on host Q
is divided into the local part and the
global part and we already mentioned
that these are not fixed in size but the
size actually fluctuates depending on
the activity and that's what we're going
to illustrate through a few example
situations so the most common case is
that I'm running a process on P and at
page faults on some page X when that
happens we have to find out if this page
X is in the global cache of some node in
the cluster let's say that this page
happens to be in the global cache of
node
q so what would happen in order to
handle this page fault is the GMs system
will locate oh this particular page it's
on host Q so it'll go to use and you go
to host Q and the host Q will then send
the page x over to node P and clearly if
there was a page fault that means that
the memory pressure on host P is
increasing and therefore it is going to
add X to its current working set that is
its local allocation of the physical
memory is going to go up by one but it
cannot go up by one without getting rid
of something from here because the some
of the local and global is the total
amount of physical memory available in
this node and therefore what P is going
to do is pick the oldest page that's
available in the global part and send it
over to node Q so in other words what we
are doing so far as host Q is concerned
is saying well X happens to be currently
in the working set let me send it to
host P and host P says well my working
set is increasing therefore I have to
shrink
my community service I'm gonna reduce
the global part by one pick the oldest
page let's say it's Y sell it over to
post Q so that the host Q can host this
new page y in the global cache on the
snowed the key takeaway for you is that
for this particular common case the
memory pressure on P is increasing so
the local allocation of the physical
memory goes up by one and the global
allocation the community service part
goes down by one on host P whereas on
host q it remains unchanged because all
that we have done is we have traded Y
for X</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
