like photos developers when things are
more than just a static page it looks
like the pipeline I talked about just
before except I'm now chucked JavaScript
at the front normally you're going to
use JavaScript to handle work that will
result in visual changes whether it's
jquery's animate function sorting a data
set or adding Dom elements to the page
but you don't have to use JavaScript for
your visual changes in fact for many
applications developers use CSS
animations transitions or even the new
web animations API to make visual
changes to their page now with that out
of the way we can talk about the
pipeline a bit more the changes we make
here won't necessarily trigger every
part of the pipeline either in fact
there are three ways the pipeline
normally plays out for a given frame so
let's talk about those for a second so
number one you make a visual change
either with CSS or JavaScript the
browser must recalculate the styles of
the elements that were affected now if
you changed a layout property so that's
one that changed in elements geometry
like its width height or position with
relation to another element like left or
top then the browser will have to check
all the other elements and reflow the
page any affected areas will need to be
repainted and the final painted elements
will need to be composited back together
the second way the pipeline gets used is
when you change a paint only property
like background image text color or
shadows this time we make the change the
styles are calculated we don't do layout
because we didn't change the geometry of
any elements we do paint and we do
composite and the last way involves
changing something that requires neither
layout nor paint just compositing
compositing is where the browser puts
the individual layers of the page
together and that requires layer
management to ensure we have the right
layers and in the correct order so we
make our change we do style calculations
but we only do composite you probably
noticed that style was always included
for each of those variations different
style
affect which parts of the pipeline we
touch and therefore the performance
characteristics of our apps</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
