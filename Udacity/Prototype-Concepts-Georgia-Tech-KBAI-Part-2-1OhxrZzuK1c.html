classical view in cognitive systems here
is an alternative view this is called
prototypical concepts / typical concept
is a base concept defined by some
typical properties that can sometimes be
overridden so an example is a chair you
and I have a notion of a plurality
co-chair our notion of a political chair
may have for example there it is a bark
it has four legs and so on so here might
be here in my notion of bur typical
chair it has a bark it as a seat it has
four legs and so on now I can represent
this notion of prototypical chair in the
language of frames this is something we
have come across earlier in the class a
frame has slots and fillers as you may
recall and we use frames represents
genotypes here we're talking a pillar
types so very closely related so concept
is the content we're going to represent
frame is the format which we could have
represented so the notion of
prototypical tree might be it has four
legs it the material is a metal it has a
back it does not have arms it's not
cushioned note that these are the
typical properties of a chair of course
some chairs need not necessarily satisfy
all of these properties that is why
their gnosis no necessary and sufficient
conditions here for example we may come
across a chair which is made of wood
while we would still consider it a chair
even if did not strictly satisfy this
particular definition thus these
properties can be overridden in case of
specific instances but we will still
have the basic notion of a prototype of
a chair so that we can in fact
communicate with each other about what a
chair is despite the fact that we can
over at these properties we do still
have a notion of prototypical chair so
the relationship between concepts and
frames actually is quite close recall
that when we were talking about frames
we were also talking about inheritance
and default the notion our default in
frames it's closely connected the notion
of typical properties in concepts so
chair has this critical notion with some
of these typical properties and we can
think of this has having a default
values but default may assume the number
of Lexus for
material is metal and so on here is a
stool and this tool is a kind of chair
which means that it inherits all the
values and all these slots that are
there in the chair directly except for
those that happen to be different from
the one in the chair so as an example
here it overrides the notion that the
clear necessarily has to have a back in
the case of us tool this tool does not
have a</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
