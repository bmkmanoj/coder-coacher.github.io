about how threads work so far on this
lesson you may be wondering how does the
memory for a thread get cleaned up after
it is finished or where does its return
value go or how can I make sure the
thread has finished its work before I
let the main thread terminate well
answer all these questions by looking at
the distinction between joinable and
detached threads let's start by talking
about what makes a thread terminate
we'll draw the main thread here on the
left our thread here on the right and
maybe there are some other threads in
between there are really two cases first
the entire process will terminate if any
thread makes a call to exit or if main
reaches the end of its code it's or
executes a return statement again this
will kill all threads associated with
the process
the second way our thread might
terminate is if he himself calls either
P thread exit or executes a return
statement the distinction between
joinable and detached threads is
important for the second case here a
thread can either be created in an
attached state or detached later with
the procedure call when the detached
thread reached the end of its execution
it's memory is cleaned up right away and
then e.returnvalue just disappears at
least no other thread has a way of
getting at it moreover we have to be
careful that Maine doesn't reach the end
of its execution and execute a return
statement before the thread is done with
its work as seen in point one if Maine
returns then the whole process
terminates so if we want to keep this
detached thread going we have to
terminate Maine with a special call to P
thread exit joinable threads by contrast
don't get destroyed right away when they
finish instead they stick around until
another thread joins them this other
thread makes a call to a thread join
specifying the thread and also an
address where the return value of the
joinable thread will get stored this
called blocks until the joinable thread
is finished though it's okay to if it's
finished already so it's okay for the
join call to be made first before the
join thread is finished having Maine
join with other threads is a common way
to make sure that Maine doesn't finish
before the other threads and kill them
all via exit method 1 by default threads
are joinable in the P threads library</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
