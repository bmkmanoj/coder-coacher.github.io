over R squared I can write an equation
like this a1 / a2 equals R 1 over R 2 to
the negative 2 and the negative is
because this is in the denominator and
the two is because our is squared well
let's take a 1 to be our normal
acceleration due to gravity G a 2 will
be our acceleration on the top of the
mountain call that 82 still r 1 is our
distance from the center of the earth
when we're at sea level so about 6,400
kilometers an hour to is nine bigger
than that because we're on the top the
Mount Everest and when you do this math
out you find that the acceleration on
the top of Mount Everest is equal to the
normal acceleration times zero point
nine nine seven well that's exactly
equal to 99.7 percent of the normal
acceleration due to gravity which means
we've decreased by about 0.3% and if
you'd made this negative that was okay
too so going from sea level to the
highest place on earth the acceleration
due to gravity only changes by less than
one percent so G really is pretty close
to being constant when you're on the
surface of the earth</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
