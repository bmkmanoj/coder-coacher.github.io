be careful about is called the we call
it the approach bias and this bias often
shows itself in the beginning of a
project or the way we approach something
yeah we see this all the time when we've
run uxd workshops at i/o and a variety
of other venues before and almost nine
times out of ten every developer when
when asked to build a Pizza ordering
application
thinks about a photorealistic Pizza
ordering widget that uses some really
nifty graphics API said they want to go
and build right now gosh NAS well I'm
getting hungry but why do you think
developers approach it this way
well developers left to code and when
asked to design a piece o during
application the first thing I think
about is what graphics API if you guys
are available on Android and what other
pinch-to-zoom and 3d photorealistic
things they can implement right now and
they want to get to it right now and
honestly as a developer even when I'm
designing things in the back of my head
I'm always thinking I build this thing
how do you approach it as a designer the
way I would approach it is this I would
try to imagine a user who's sitting
there using their phone and they're
hungry for pizza and they pull up an
application and they want to go from
being hungry to being satisfied and I
think about what is the flow I could
create in an application that would let
them go from being hungry to satisfied
as quickly as possible with as little
friction as possible and make them happy
so that's kind of like the pure designer
approach but the way that we really want
to go about this is is not exactly the
developer approach or the designer
approach we want to do something that's
kind of meets meets it in the middle so
as a development minded designer I think
what you would want to do is design is
something really great empathize with
your user but keep constraints in mind
and keep the the question of whether you
can really build this in mind know
exactly and another thing is you and I
are very familiar with software and the
way we think about interaction design
patterns and libraries are not the same
as a user we're building things we have
a certain bias because we're so familiar
with these toolkits and platforms that
we end up having assumptions about how
somebody will actually use a particular
widget or control and that's not exactly
how a real user might do it now that we
discussed approach bias think about the
most recent project that you worked on
think about what you did on day
one or how you first approach this
project did any of your approaches
actually bias the final product</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
