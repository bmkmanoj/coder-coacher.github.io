probably know that ideas come at some
point of time and the practical use may
come at a much later point of time an
excellent example of that is boolean
algebra which was invented at the turn
of the century as a pure mathematical
exercise by George Boole
now boolean algebra is the basis for
pretty much anything and everything we
do as computers the concept of
virtualization also had its beginning
way back in time it started with IBM
vm/370 in the 60s in the early 70s and
intent in IBM vm/370 was to give the
illusion to every user on the computer
as though the computer is this that was
the vision and it is also a vehicle for
binary support for legacy applications
that may run on older versions of IBM
platforms and then of course we had the
micro kernels that we have discussed in
the earlier course module which surfaced
in the 80s and early 90s that in turn
gave way the extensibility of operating
systems in the 90s the Stanford project
Samoas in the late 90s laid the basis
for the modern resurgence of
virtualization technology at the
operating system level and in fact was
the basis for VMware even the specific
ideas we're going to explore in this
course module through Xen and VMware are
papers that date back to the early 2000s
they were proposed from the point of
view of supporting application mobility
server consolidation co-locating hosting
facilities distributed web services
these were all sort of the candidate
applications for which Xen and VMware
were positioning this virtualization
technology and now today virtualization
has taken off like anything
why the big resurgence today well
companies want a share of everybody's
pie one of the things that has become
very obvious is the margin for device
making companies in terms of profits is
very small and everybody wants to get
into providing services for end-users
this was pioneered by IBM and others are
following suit as well so the attraction
with virtualization technology is that
companies can now provide resources with
complete performance isolation and build
each individual user separately and
companies like Microsoft Amazon HP you
name and everybody is in this game
wanting to provide computing facilities
through their data centers to a wide
diversity of user communities so that
it's a win-win situation for both the
users that do not want to maintain their
own computing infrastructure and
constantly upgrading them and the
companies like IBM that has a way of
providing these resources on a rental
basis on a utility basis to the user
community you can see the dots
connecting up from the extensibility
studies of the 90s like the spin and
exokernel to virtualization today that
is providing computational resources
much like we depend on utility companies
to provide electricity and water
in other words virtualization technology
has made computing very much like the
other utilities that were used to such
as electricity and water and so on and
that's the reason why there is a huge
resurgence in the use of virtualization
technology in all the data centers
across the world</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
