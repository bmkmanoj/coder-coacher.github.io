great work if you found this number we
can start solving this equation by
multiplying through by the LCD the
lowest common denominator in this case
is X minus 5 times X plus 5 the product
of these two denominators when we
multiply we'll get 15 times X plus 5
here plus 15 times X minus 5 here equal
to 4 times X minus 5 times X plus 5 I
multiplied these two binomials together
since we have a minus B times a plus B
that's a squared minus B squared our
difference of squares pattern next we
distribute the 15 here and here and the
street with a positive for to get this
new equation combining like terms on the
left side of the equation will have 15 X
plus 15x which equals 30 X the positive
75 and the negative 75 some 20 next we
want to try and factor this quadratic
equation so we'll need to move this 30 x
over to the right hand side in order to
set the quadratic equal to 0 I'll list
the 4x squared term first then the
negative 30x term and then negative 100
all of these terms are even so we can
divide our entire equation by 2 here
will want to use factoring by grouping
in order to factor this quadratic we
find factors of 2 times negative 50
which is negative 100 that's sum to
negative 15 negative 20 and positive 5
multiplied to give us negative 100 and
they sum to negative 15 so we'll use
these two numbers to rewrite negative
15x as a negative 20x plus 5x then we
just use factoring by grouping to get
two factors of 2x plus 5 and X minus 10
we set each of these factors equal to 0
so X could equal 10 or X could equal
negative 5 halves we know X really
represents Katrina speed so we can't use
the negative value it's invalid this is
how we know Katrina travels at 10 miles
per hour</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
