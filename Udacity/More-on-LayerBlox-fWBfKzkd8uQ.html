generator are there any other pieces of
the technology that you want to say
anything about sure so once we built the
code generator we built a number of
supporting tools that were useful in
just understanding these assemblies and
communicating them to two others one of
them is a graphical visualization tool
that will let you let you look at in
graph form in a dot form one of your
similar specs so that you can see
exactly what the dependencies are how
the different refinements compose with
one another that's been really useful
particularly as we were developing our
feature of libraries to begin with
because we found that over time we could
compare these these different
visualizations and we could see them
getting simpler and somewhere that was
very useful we also did we implemented
some code metrics so that we could track
how large or small our refinements were
we we apophis eyes and this is actually
born out to be true that over time and
after a lot of use big refinements will
break down into compositions of smaller
ones in fact that's happened and we use
code metrics now to help us find
candidates that we should should go kind
of proactively dive into so yeah there
are a number of little tools and
supports like that that are pretty
useful</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
