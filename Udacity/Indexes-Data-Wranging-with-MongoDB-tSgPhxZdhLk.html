database performance in MongoDB is
driven by pretty much the same thing
that every database is driven by which
is are you going to use an index to
resolve your query or not so this may be
review for a lot of you but I want to
take you through the basics of indexing
and what it is and why it's so effective
if you look at MongoDB or any other
database it will store its data in these
large files on disk there's no
particular order for the documents on
the disk they can be anywhere in a
database file if you want to pull out a
particular document you do a query now
what the database is going to have to do
by default is scan through the entire
collection to find the data this is
called a table scan in relational
databases and a collection scan in
MongoDB it is death to your performance
if the data set is large it'll be
extremely slow so instead what we do is
we create an index or maybe more than
one index so how does indexing work well
it's actually pretty straightforward if
something is ordered like for instance
this list of hash tags even if it's very
long it's very quick to find something
in the list because we can use binary
search to do it so finding something in
a sorted list is really quick now to
create an index we want to specify a key
an index is simply an ordered list of
keys now we don't actually keep them
linearly ordered like this in MongoDB we
use something called a b-tree but
conceptually you could imagine it
looking like this it's perfectly
reasonable conceptual model and if I'm
looking for let's say Lucero I can
quickly search find the item and then
have a pointer to the actual document or
documents inside the collection that
have this hash tag associated with them
so this picture actually represents an
index that is composed of just hash tags
so we're using a single field as the
basis for our index but this is just a
special case of the more general idea of
indexes in MongoDB in MongoDB indexes
are ordered lists of keys you can have
just one as we saw in the previous
example or we could do something like
yes and construct an index out of three
keys let's say for example the hashtag
the date on which a tweet was created
and the username of the person creating
the tweet the order is important here
because conceptually the way the index
is built is that the hashtag will be at
the top so here my hashtags Colin hey
Lucero and then Steve Earl near the end
of my index and then within this so
let's say Colin hey is conceptually here
for all of those items we'll have dates
as the second level of our index and
what we're going to do within the Colin
Hay portion of the index is sort these
by order of date so the documents then
that are identified down to this level
of date are first identified by the
hashtag Colin hey and then sorted based
on their date of creation and then
finally within each date so for each day
on which a tweet was created with the
hashtag Colin hey we're going to have
the usernames of all of those users and
those then will be sorted as well so if
you provide me just the hashtag I can go
into the index and find all the let's
say loose arrows in this case and if you
prefer to also provide me the date then
I can break it down and find all the
loose arrow tweets on that particular
day at the very bottom of this of course
is going to be pointers to the actual
data now in order for MongoDB to utilize
an index you have to give it a leftmost
set of items so you can give it just the
hash tag or you can give it just the
hash tag in the date or the hash tag the
date and the username for this
particular index if you provide me just
the date I can't do much really with the
index because the date is down here at
this level so to use an index I need to
start at the top and this is true
whether or not I'm doing a query or I'm
doing an update or I'm doing a sort
because sorts also will use an index to
sort their values so for instance if I
pull a bunch of data out of the
collection and want to sort it by hash
tag with MongoDB I can use this index to
do the sorting now one other point I
want to make is that every time you want
to insert something into the database
this index would need to be updated and
that updating is going to take some time
so we use into
is to make reads faster but writes
become a little bit slower if you have
an index because the index needs to be
updated so you need to take that into
consideration when you're thinking about
what indexes you might want for your
particular application indexes are not
costless they take space on disk they
also take time to keep updated so you
don't want to have an index on every
single possible way you're going to
query the collection you instead want to
have an index on the ways you're most
likely to query the collection</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
