joint business development they managed
to exchange advertising dollars for a
prominent position on the outside of
computer manufacturers boxes what
computer manufacturers got in exchange
was gross margin that they never would
have gotten in a low margin business
Starbucks and Pepsi to promote
Frappuccino was a great example of a
strategic alliance Apple and the record
labels was another example of a great
strategic alliance but Apple and Foxconn
is a great example of a supplier and
might at times actually be a good
example of the joint venture as well
Fashion Week well that's an example of
coopertition normally at other times of
the year these high-end clothing
manufacturers compete with each other
for ously but once a year they get
together and cooperate in creating the
industry standards groups are another
example where competitors get together
put aside their differences and work
together towards a common goal of trying
to come up with a set of mutually agreed
standards so kind of the ringer in here
that is the one I didn't describe but
all you had to do is go on Google is the
most famous aircraft partnership ever
made were for the two of the most
unlikely partners were GE and a French
aircraft manufacturer came together to
do a joint venture for the cfm56 jet
engine which was one of the most popular
turbo fans in the world and so that was
a great example of a joint venture and
also had a bit of co-op Atisha and as
well and then finally for traffic
partners if you think about all the
online airline scheduling sites kayak
Expedia Hipmunk there are all traffic
partners for the airline industry and in
fact that's how they make their money is
that while you're having a great time
figuring out multiple airline schedules
every time you click through to buy a
ticket they are getting paid by the
airlines and that's how they make their
money so I hope these were a good
example helped you understand the
different types of relationships and as
I said sometimes they kind of blur
between each other sometimes it might
start with coopertition turn into a
strategic alliance and then some they
might actually be a joint venture but
the whole idea is that
you're working together with others to
help build your company</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
