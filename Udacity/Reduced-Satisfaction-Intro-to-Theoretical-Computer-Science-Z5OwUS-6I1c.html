implementing some pre-processing rules
for set and we're going to be using the
same format to represent SAT as in the
problem set for unit 2 so if you have
any questions about that go ahead and
read through this part or go back and
look at the problem set for unit 2 now
what you're going to be doing is writing
a function that when given a boolean
formula in the above format we perform a
few data reduction rules and outputs the
resulting set of clauses the goal for
this is that we're going to give the
actual SAT solver a much much smaller
well hopefully much smaller boolean
formula then it would ordinarily get and
hopefully we can improve the performance
of sat in that way now the data
reduction rules we're going to be
performing are these four here first if
any clause consists of a single variable
we're going to set that variable so that
the clause is satisfied so if the clause
just consists of x2 for instance then
we'll set it to true whereas if the
clause just consists of not x2 we're
going to set x 2 to false and that way
we know that X 2 has to be that in order
for the boolean formula to be satisfied
the second one is that if a variable
appears just once and it hasn't been set
then we set it so that the respective
clause is satisfied the third rule is
that we remove all clauses that have
become satisfied that way we just don't
have to worry about them anymore in the
upcoming sat solver the fourth final
rule is that we remove all variables
that evaluate to false so all variables
X that are set to false and all
variables not X where X is set to true
for instance that we know are set in
that manner now if this results in an
empty clause then well that means the
import formula doesn't have any
satisfying assignment for that variable
which means that the boolean formula
itself isn't satisfiable so then the
function should return the boolean
formula 1 negative 1 and that is so that
when we give it to a Sat solver it will
always result as unsatisfiable now the
difficult part is implementing rule 2
and rule for that's because your
function must perform the
these data reduction rules exhaustively
until they can't be applied any further
so after you apply these rules there
might be other clauses for which these
rules now apply that they didn't apply
to before now you'll have to be careful
if a variable that now appears once has
already been set earlier if not then
Rule two may apply otherwise it doesn't
now remember that during the course of
this pre-processing we can't change the
satisfiability of the overall formula or
else the pre-processing rules aren't
really helpful at all if a set problem
is satisfiable the output of the
pre-processing also needs to be
satisfiable so go ahead and implement
this function in the space given</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
