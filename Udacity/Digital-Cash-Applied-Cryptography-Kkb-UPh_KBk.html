really a promise from a trusted bank
it's a promise that says if someone
brings this money to the bank the bank
will exchange it for something of real
value today we think of the paper itself
as having real value but in the early
days what the paper meant was you could
go to the bank and exchange it for
something that everyone recognizes real
value say a bar of gold almost as
valuable as a gold star so if that's
what money means well then we should be
able to do the same thing with
cryptography let's see how that would
work so Alice would go to indivisible
Prime Bank which everyone knows is very
trustworthy and she would give the bank
a hundred dollars in some other currency
let's assume the bank takes US dollars
so the bank will write a message that
says the bank owes the bearer of this
note $100 and the bank will sell send
Alice a signed version of that message
to the message along with its signature
which is signed by the bank using the
bank's private key signing a hash of
that message so this signature proves
that it's a valid IOU from this bank and
now Alice has something representing
currency now Alice could spend the
currency she could buy some tacos from
Bob's taco Emporium
give him the currency pretty expensive
tacos and Bob could take the note this
sign message from the bank and give it
to the bank and asked the bank to
deposit into his account so now the
question is how well would the scheme
that I've described work and let's
assume that everyone in the universe
trusts indivisible primes and knows that
bank's public key</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
