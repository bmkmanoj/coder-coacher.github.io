figure out how to build the HTTP request
such that we can pass all seven of these
form elements now the question is where
do these elements come from in most
cases when you see form elements showing
up that aren't obviously part of the
form itself and by that I mean aren't
part of the user interface now it's got
to be going on here is that we have
hidden form elements so let's figure out
where they're at so here's the start of
the form if we look down through I don't
obviously see any other elements so I
bet it's in some of this stuff that's
zipped up here so let's take a look and
sure enough right here we find three
hidden form elements so now we've
accounted for six of the seven elements
we've got to pass along the carrier the
airport the submit button and then these
three and we can see that right here
view state okay is one of those with the
very long value if I open this up I see
that here we have one of those other
values the other one in fact that makes
scrolling through all the form data in
the network tab such a long and tedious
process okay so now we've identified
where all seven of the form fields are
the question then becomes how do we
build our HTTP requests such that this
data is included because that's really
what we have to do here in addition to
the carrier the airport in the submit
button we've got to send these along as
well so in this exercise what I'd like
you to do is write some code here that
uses the beautifulsoup module and
assigns values to event validation and
viewstate
such that they have the correct values
the values that this datasource is
expecting to see come across and a
little bit we'll talk about why these
values are necessary for right now let's
just focus on building the request
properly</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
