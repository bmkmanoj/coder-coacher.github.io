as you see it looks a little nicer than
it was before and it didn't really
change that much as I just made a few
changes so I just want to point them out
to you so that you can you know what
they are and the main thing one of the
main things I did is really to introduce
these derived attributes so these are
attributes that are basically computed
based on some other attributes okay they
don't have a value themselves but their
value is computed and you know I used to
the first one is age so basically we
know the age of the patron based on the
birthdate of the patron so you guys I
don't know if you have that information
currently in the system now well we'll
have to add that to the form patron to
fill out when they get their card is
that an issue can you do it now yes we
can easily do that okay so then perfect
so we'll do it that way I think it's a
little cleaner and similarly since you
told me that the fine was computed based
on the amount of days that then an item
was late or the patron was later
returning the item then I also added
this as a derived attribute that is
computed based on the on the due date
and and when the item is actually
returned makes sense like that okay
you know and the rest is kind of really
minor things so that the only one I want
to point out is a I didn't you know
discuss that with you before but I added
this which is called cardinality for
some of these relationships and what
they say is basically is how many how
many elements are involved in the
relationship so min the stars
yeah like the Stars and the one so here
for example this is telling you that for
each item there is only one title and
that for each title there are multiple
items the star means many stars means
men okay sorry that's a kind of computer
science lingo use the star for that kind
of stuff and this is similarly for the
patron is telling me that you know each
patron can have a multiple can request
multiple titles and that the same title
can be requested by multiple patrons
which i think is the way that the system
works right so except for these minor
changes that we've already had a pretty
good model in our hands so I think this
is a we can finalize this and then just
move to the low level design and then
the implementation and be done with the
system sounds good</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
