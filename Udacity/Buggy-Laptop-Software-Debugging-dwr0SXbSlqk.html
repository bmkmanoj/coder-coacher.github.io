favorite story on bug reproduction in
2002 I went to a conference to give a
laptop demonstration of a complex
software system before I left we had
taken every precaution that the software
would run perfectly but then came the
evening before the demonstration I would
be sitting in my hotel room and try out
for the last time whether everything
would be working fine nothing worked the
software would run into timeout errors
anytime everywhere I phoned my
department at home they had the same
software on the same machine and
everything worked I debug this for three
hours in a row my battery had even run
out of power so I had to recharge it
that's when I decided to restart from
scratch to my amazement the demo now ran
just fine and so I wondered why did the
program work after restarting from
scratch was this because of some caching
problem did this have something to do
with the battery was this because i
reinstalled everything or because of
cosmic radiation hint I gave you an
indication right within the story over
to you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
