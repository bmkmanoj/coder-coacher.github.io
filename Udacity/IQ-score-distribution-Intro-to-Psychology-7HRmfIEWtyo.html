IQ test can tell you they're widely used
and can be pretty useful especially for
educators
the popularity of IQ tests have been
able to give us extensive knowledge of
the range of IQ scores let's look at
what IQ scores look like for the entire
population IQ scores are converted to
have a mean of 100 now the standard
variation around the mean is 15 points
this standard variation is called the
standard deviation this shows how much
the score varies from the mean so the
mean would be 0 because there's no
difference 15 points one way would be
one standard deviation two standard
deviations and three standard deviations
same with the other way one standard
deviation from the mean two standard
deviations from the mean and three
standard deviations from the mean
68% of the population is within one
standard deviation from the mean so 68%
of the population has an IQ score
between 85 and 115 now 95% of the
population is within 2 standard
deviations from the mean so 95% of the
people you know scored between 70 and
130 on an IQ test and ninety-nine point
seven percent of the population scores
within three standard deviations of the
mean
so between 55 and 145 now as you can see
with ninety-nine point seven percent of
the population scoring within three
standard deviations in either direction
of the mean that doesn't leave a lot of
room for people to score above a 145 or
below a 55 it's only about 15 out of a
thousand people score higher or lower
than either one of these two extremes we
also did an example like this in lesson
two the research methods lesson you
should go back and check it out if this
is a little confusing now traditionally
those who have extreme IQ scores are
given labels such as a genius who scores
above 140 on an IQ test because not a
lot of the population scores that high
or intellectually disabled those who
score less than 70 on an IQ test because
again not
out of the population scores that low</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
