so you may have noticed when I was
entering text in the in the editor
before that even though I put text on
multiple lines when I rendered it in
HTML it rendered all on a single line
this is because in HTML all whitespace
new lines tab spaces all turn into a
single space so force our HTML to have
multiple lines we can use another tag
called the BR tag it looks like this it
is also a void tag stands for break and
it's a void tag and you put this after
after any lines that you want to appear
on multiple lines let's let's play round
up this in the browser a little bit here
we are in the browser let's let's enter
some text we've got this text that's
really too long for one line and when we
render this it appears as one line let's
put a line break here when I render this
it still appears as one line if we want
to render multiple lines we can enter
the BR tag like here no problem and now
we have a line break and we can even
enter multiple BR tags if we want
multiple line breaks okay there we go
two line breaks or two BRS equals two
line breaks
cool huh another way of doing line
breaks is to use the P tag this stands
for paragraph this is not a void tag so
the P tag has content and it looks like
this so it's the you know because it's
not a voit AG it has a closing tag and
we have an opening tag so you've got
opening P contact closing P and this
will render as one paragraph let's check
this out on the browser really quick
okay so we've got these two lines let's
take a different approach I'm going to
start this line with a paragraph tag and
we'll render this AHA now we've got a
line break here in our text now the font
got bigger and that's kind of a side
effect of our HTML tool there must be a
some sort of style set on P that doesn't
normally happen I'm going to wrap the
bottom line with a paragraph as well
okay there we go now we've got two lines
the same kind of basic idea as we had
before now we'll talk about why there's
this extra space in here even though
there's no space with
this text up here we'll come to that in
a minute but first quiz time take this
text here hello everyone we're using two
lines now and enter the HTML to draw
that as it's formatted here with two
lines and I want you to use the the BR
tag</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
