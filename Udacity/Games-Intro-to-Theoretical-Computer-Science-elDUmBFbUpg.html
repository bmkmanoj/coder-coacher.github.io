question now we have always said that NP
complete problems are very hard or
challenging problems other problems that
are even more difficult to solve than NP
complete problems and the answer might
surprise you actually finding an optimum
strategy in most games such as chess or
checkers turns out to be harder than
np-complete of course when I say chess
or checkers I do not mean the normal
eight by eight board that you're playing
on but rather it's generalized versions
of those games where you can have an
arbitrarily large board the reason of
course being that if you fix this as
eight by eight then the problem size or
input size is always fixed so a concept
like NP completeness does not apply you
always need an input size but if you
take the dimensions of the board as an
input size then certain questions about
these games become provably harder than
np-complete so the problem of
determining for a given game position on
an N by n chessboard if white can force
a win which means that no matter how
good black place white can always find a
strategy to win asking that question is
believed to be much harder than solving
an np-complete problem now I say
believed to be because this hardness
requires that P does not equal NP if P
equals NP then actually many variants of
this question here and there are
different ones will also be solvable in
polynomial time but in the case that P
does not equal NP this problem here is
much harder than NP complete problems
there are even some problems that are
provably harder than NP complete
problems so even if P were equal to NP
these problems would be harder and I'll
give you one example for that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
