mean there's so many I could go on for
hours but I won't hmm then if it's a
bootstrapping essentially come down to
manifest destiny you are in control of
everything that you are doing assuming
that you are a sole proprietor if you
have partners well you have some control
might be limited with with a little
bickering between your team but
fundamentally you are in control of your
life or you will feel in control of your
life in what you're doing it's a very
powerful sense of being when you have
that second thing is you get to define
your own rules for the most part I mean
obviously you can't stray off the path
and start breaking the laws but you are
free to dictate the path forward for
yourself and what that value means for
your company or your business the other
advantages are you're not going to ever
become beholden to somebody for the
actions you're taking now if the value
that you are trading is parts of your
company or parts of your product that go
into perpetuity like you know giving
someone a percentage in exchange for
money that's not bootstrapping that's
selling your business or selling your
product and you want to steer away from
that if you're bootstrapping
bootstrapping is the pure creation
process of taking something or creating
something that wasn't there before and
making it a thing that generates value
for you into the future</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
