waving you like to do let's actually
write out some equations okay there's no
need to fear the equations Michael so
I'm going to leave our little picture up
so you can remember what it was we're
talking about and i'm going to leave up
the definition or the tuple part of what
an option is so that you remember that
and then I'm just going to write an
equation up here and here it is so V sub
T plus 1 of s equals max / 0 of the
quantity R of s comma 0 plus sum over s
prime of SFO s.o.s prime times V city of
s prime what does that equation look
like to you well it has a lot in common
with the bellman equation right and in
fact that's exactly what it is it is a
rewriting of the bellman operator so
what do you think the various
constituent parts are well I don't I'm
maybe an easier thing to do would be to
explain what looks like it might be
different okay so for one thing a has
become 0 because I guess actions have
become possibly temporarily extended
actions or options or options good do we
need to include a in there as well like
why can we ignore all the A's well
because the A's are inside the O's the
A's are inside the O's yes there's
actually an o inside an a well I think
that depends upon whether it's a
lowercase or capital a that's fair thank
you but I don't I still don't quite
understand like so so you're saying
options are made out of actions yes
because there may they have little
policies but can you have an option that
is just in action of course right so
options are a generalization of actions
if I wanted to take an action and I
wanted to turn it into an option then
the initiation set would just be
everywhere where that action is valid
the policy inside that option would just
say for whatever state I'm in take that
action with probability 1 and all other
actions with probability 0 and then the
termination probability would be one for
all of the states that i can i can reach
from that particular state to particular
action actually would just be one
everywhere one everywhere i see i say oh
that's okay that's actually really cute
that kind of helps me understand why
these three quantities are the way that
they are so so it allows it to
specifically say oh yeah
well we can always include an action
which is a primitive action that just
you can use it wherever you can use the
action it just does the action and then
it stops right away right exactly okay
all right good so then the oh ok I get
the O's generalizing the a UH then
another difference is there's no
discount factor that I can see and then
the last difference is that you seem to
have spelled T as an F right well you
know F&amp;amp;T are the same for an appropriate
kind of thinking about only in logic
only in logic yeah tnf are the same
actually they're the opposite in logic
oh whoops yeah t is true and F is false
and thought about that that's kind of a
interesting thing that we could talk
about for an hour and a half or I could
just explain to you what F is so you did
the right thing you notice that we still
have a reward function as we did before
in the bellman operator we still have
value functions we're trying to trying
to update value over States we have
little esas in the S Prime's the O's are
basically a so that doesn't seem
different but the two big differences
are lack of a discount factor which
isn't quite true we actually have a
discount factor but it's hidden and
instead of a transition model we have F
so f is you know this really is a bit of
an operator f is sort of I think clearly
playing the role of a transition
function it's somehow telling you
something about states options and next
states and what I really need to do to
make this clear i think is just really
write out what F is so that would be
super helpful that would be really nice
but it turns out that i have to write
out something else as well and that is
our so our looks sort of superficially
like the reward function that we've had
before although in this case the reward
is from you know taking a particular
option in particular state but actually
this reward function is hiding a lot of
complexity as well and to see what that
complexity is I think it helps to draw a
picture</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
