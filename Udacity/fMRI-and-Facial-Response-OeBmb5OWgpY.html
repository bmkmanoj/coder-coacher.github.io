what's going on inside human brains and
presume these presuming these are people
you actually like so how would you
measure what's going on in their brain
well you're not going to stick
electrodes in their brain what you're
going to do is something called fMRI
okay or functional magnetic resonance
imaging so many of you probably had an
MRI or at MRI uses a strong magnetic
fields to sort of mess around with
electrons in order to be able to get
differential density measurements well
you can do something cool also you can
use a dye contrast that the magnetic
fields perturb differently depending
upon how much oxygen is in that part of
the the blood so just like we did before
with that experiment with the monkeys
where you injected sort of that
radioactive isotope connect the oxygen
now what we can do is we can have you
have died contrast go into an fMRI have
you look at things and see what parts of
your brain are lighting up all right so
here's an example sort of notionally of
an fMRI activation so this is of course
obviously a reconstruction based upon
the density and here you can see the
activity that's being done this is a
three-dimensional reconstruction this is
what a slice would actually look like
right this is a single activation slice
and these colors are different levels of
activation compared against a background
activation so one of the areas that
people were studying a lot and arguing
about was was there a part of the brain
that seemed very responsive to faces
okay and it's called the fusiform face
area and it's a little bit controversial
as to whether or not something really
responds to just faces or other sorts of
patterns this is a paper recently 2004
actually Nancy kanwisher last off of
there was a graduate student when I was
same department and does great work on
understanding physiology and and these
papers one of the well-known papers
grill specter at all and they're just
focusing on this area this FFA fusiform
face area in terms of understanding
where faces light things up one of the
reasons for looking at faces is that
there's been a long history of sort of
faces being
special in human vision so there's
examples that very very early on in an
infant's life they have a preference and
they do test called preferential looking
if you put something up the infant tend
to look this way okay so the the
experimenter holds something experiment
it doesn't know whether it's a picture
of actually a face something blank like
this or something that has the same face
pieces on it all the experiment does
that he or she holds something up and he
just says yep I think you look this way
yep nope and the question is do you tend
to get them looking more when you
actually put up a picture of a face and
the answer is it says here early minute
just say very early in life there seems
to be a preference for faces likewise
there were responses of cells various
other things responding to this is a
cell recording that when shown faces
responds and when shown these other
things fruits hands etc don't likewise
there are measurements using this fMRI
of areas that respond to faces and so
this is another paper in another picture
from that same paper i showed you before
and you'll see here that they've got
different object types that they're
showing and the idea is that different
parts see so you see this area here that
lights up really well with faces and
doesn't here here here here or there and
the idea is that these are other objects
that sort of took the same amount of
location and intensities etc but only
lit up when the faces were there so it
was an example of understanding a part
of the brain doing a particular process</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
