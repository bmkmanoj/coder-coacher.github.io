and the power consumption of an entire
town to study tiny sub-nuclear effects
they built telescopes distributed over
several continents or orbiting the earth
and space to look back or out into the
universe
so isn't our knowledge of physics
accurate enough already and how many
significant digits do we really need of
building big accelerators is not to
improve the number of significant
figures it is to discover new phenomena
it is just to discover in discovering
for example that a nucleus is made of
protons and neutrons that was a
discovery at one time one wasn't one
wasn't improving the accuracy of the old
theory one was discovering something
genuinely new no phenomena that there
are things called protons and neutrons
when the atom was discovered to be
electrons going around in orbit in
quantum mechanical orbits that was not
improving accuracy it was discovering a
whole new way to fear to think about the
world the big machines that are being
built to understand let us say
elementary particles are not being built
to improve for the purpose of improving
the accuracy let's say for chemistry or
for whatever they're being built to try
to understand what then what the real
phenomena at the the basic our basic
understanding of the world and of what
makes up matter what makes up things and
it's not that it's going to improve the
accuracy it's going to change the whole
picture of the way we think things work
the same is true with the big telescopes
now sometimes it's important to improve
accuracy we have various ideas for
example about something called dark
energy dark energy is the energy that's
out there in space that is causing the
universe to accelerate and expand faster
and faster
the various ideas may be very different
than each other but they may give rise
to answers which are pretty similar and
in that case we build the machines to be
more accurate to describe to try to
discriminate between different
possibilities but the different
possibilities really describe very very
different kinds of understandings of the
world so sometimes yes we just really do
want to improve the number of
significant figures also sometimes in
improving the number of significant and
figures figures you discover
discrepancies an example might be
studying the properties that details
properties of electrons the properties
of electrons many of them are known to
God knows how many significant figures
eight let us say that's a lot of
significant figures supposing we make a
more accurate measurement and we
discover that in the ninth significant
figure we don't agree experiment with
theory that could really tell us
something very deep about what the next
step will be in understanding elementary
particles so yeah we do want to improve
accuracy but mostly we want to discover
a new phenomenon new not just new
phenomena but new understandings of of
what the old phenomena are</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
