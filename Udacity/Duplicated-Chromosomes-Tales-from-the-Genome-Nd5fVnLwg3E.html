it's time we clear up something that
could cause us trouble later maybe
causing some of you some stress if you
have any experience with chromosomes
before this picture that you saw earlier
is in fact a real picture of human
chromosomes from a cell let's focus in
on this pair of chromosomes here they
sort of look like big X's don't they if
I were to try to draw them in cartoon
form this is how I would probably try to
represent them and although this is an
accurate representation of what you see
here in reality this type of chromosome
is called a duplicated chromosome it's
called a duplicated chromosome because
of each side of the x is actually
identical to the other side and we refer
to each of these sides as chromatids in
fact because they're so identical we
refer to them as sister chromatids this
chromosome over here also has sister
chromatids so we have one pair of
chromosomes one pair of X's and they eat
your composed of sister chromatids which
are duplicated strands of each other
however most of the time chromosomes
look like this instead they don't look
like an X they're just one linear
molecule we call this a non duplicated
chromosome this is what the pair
typically looks like in a cell remember
linear chromosomes are just double
stranded DNA in one really long molecule
wrapped up in histone proteins into a
higher order structure that looks like
the chromosome we're used to seeing but
after duplication the double-stranded
DNA is now copied and now there are two
copies two double-stranded molecules of
DNA and they're joined together in the
middle here and this is what makes them
look like these big X's over here and
because there are genetically identical
we call these sister chromatids here
within this X that's what the sister
chromatids are but we still call the
linear non duplicated chromosome a
chromosome and we call the duplicated
version
sister chromatids a chromosome it's
still a chromosome structure the reason
most pictures you've seen of chromosomes
look like this is because this is when
their most condensed and easy to see as
you can imagine DNA is like a big loose
string that's really long inside a cell
and it's normally sort of loosey-goosey
hanging out but when a cell divides it
has to organize and get everything
together and choreograph to separate and
so it condenses into these beautiful
organized structures that make it easy
for us to see so a scientist will wait
until a cell gets to this point and then
it opens the cell up to see the
chromosome and because we're at this
stage after the DNA has been duplicated
they look like this X structure but they
can also look like this non x or just
linear structure now I want you to tell
me of the following four groupings of
chromosomes which of the following
represents four chromosomes either
duplicated or non duplicated pick which
ones represent four chromosomes there
can be multiple answers or there may not
so I want you to check all the boxes
that you think apply</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
