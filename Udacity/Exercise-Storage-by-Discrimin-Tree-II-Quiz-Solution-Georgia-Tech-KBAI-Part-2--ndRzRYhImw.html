right here and why right here we've got
a line that goes through the to the
differentiates them that roughly lines
up with 2e so I said to e that looks
like a good answer to me recall that
when we were using the table to organize
the case memory previously we were very
concerned that the size of the table
will grow very large it will become very
difficult to search for a specific case
in that table discrimination trees
provide a potential answer to that by
asking a question we are quickly able to
prune away one part of the tree that
makes this search process much more
efficient and lets the point of the
discrimination tree in both
organizational scheme the table and the
discrimination tree we are trying to
accommodate and accumulate new cases but
in the case of the discrimination tree
by asking the right questions to the
right knows we make the search process
more efficient so for those of you
familiar with Big O notation you'll
notice that the efficiency of searching
the case library organized by indices
was linear whereas here it's logarithmic</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
