course in machine learning this section
is going to be on unsupervised learning
that sounds fun hi Michael
oh hey Charles I didn't even know you
were here that's cuz I'm not really
there oh I'm glad to hear your voice
regardless good I'm always happy to hear
your voice Michael and I'm looking
forward to hearing about unn -
supervised learning
well unsupervised learning is going to
be a series of lectures that we do but
today's lecture is on his tis mini
yahwah ok which is randomized
optimization i took the letters of
optimization and i randomized them is
such a nerd
i love it ok alright so so the plan is
to talk about optimization and in
particular to focus on some algorithms
that use randomization to be more
effective but let's um let's talk a
little bit about optimization for a
moment because that's something that has
come up but we haven't really spent any
time on it so what i'm thinking about
when i when i talk about optimization i
imagine that there's some input space X
which is you know kind of like in the
machine learning setting and we've also
we're also given access to an objective
function or fitness function f that
map's any of the inputs in the input
space to a real number of score
sometimes called the Fitness sometimes
called the objective sometimes called
score it can be any of number of things
but in in the setting that we're talking
about right now the goal is to find some
value x star in the input space such
that the fitness value for that X star
is equal to or maybe as close as
possible to the maximum possible value
so that's like Arg max then like we were
doing with
Bayesian learning yeah exactly right so
of all the possible X's to choose we'd
like to choose the one that that causes
the function value to be the highest
okay yeah I wrote it this way though
because I thought it would probably be
helpful if it's like because we'd be
pretty happy with a with an x star that
isn't necessarily the best but it's like
near Arg max right something that's
close to the best okay so one so this is
a really important sub problem it comes
up very often I was wondering if you
could think of examples where that might
be
be a good thing to do well in life like
in life um computation which is life
computation is life in life is
computation well believe it or not I was
actually just talking to someone the
other day who works at a chemical is a
chemical engineer it works at a chemical
plant and he says there's all these
parameters they have to tune in when
they mix their little magical chemicals
and if they do it just right they end up
with something that you know is exactly
the right temperature comes out just
right if they're wrong at all that some
of their temperature is off a little bit
or anything is wrong then it ends up
costing a lot of money and not coming
out to be as good as they want it to be
so you know factories and chemicals in
optimization and parameters factory
chemical I'm not sure that's a general
category of problem but I guess I guess
maybe the one way to think about it is
in we'll call it process control so if
you've got a process that you're trying
to put together and you have some way of
measuring how well it's going
like yield or cost or something like
that then you could imagine optimizing
the the process itself to try to improve
your score okay yeah I think that's what
I meant
you know route-finding is kind of like
this as well right so just you know find
me the best way to get to Georgia
what about route-finding oh I see what
you did there so you could think of
route-finding as being a kind of
optimization as well if you've got
function and you're trying to figure out
where it crosses the the origin you
might at you might set that up as an
optimization problem might say well of
all the different positions I could be
in I want to minimize the distance
between the axis and the value at the
point where I chose it find me the best
one which you know is going to be right
there actually you know when you put it
like that how about a neural networks
nice so that's yeah let's get it back to
the learning setting so what is what do
you mean by neural networks well I mean
everything we've been talking about so
far X you know some kind of stand-in for
parameters of something a process or I
don't know whatever so if the weights
are just parameters of a neural network
then we want to find the
that I guess minimizes our error over
some training set or upcoming testers
yeah so minimizing error is a kind of
optimization it's not a max in this case
but if we I guess negate it you want to
maximize the negative error that it's
maximized when the error is zero right
cool as any other learning related
topics that you can think of that have
optimization in them well I would guess
anything with parameters where some
parameters are better than others and
you have some way of measuring how good
they are is an optimization problem so
decision trees sure so what's the
parameters there they're the order of
the nodes the actual knows what's the
first node yeah the whole structure of
the tree so it's not a continuous value
like like a weight but it is a structure
we could try to optimize over the
structure there's nothing in the way
that I set this up here that makes it so
that X has to be continuous or anything
like that we just need a way of mapping
inputs to scores okay so all of the
machine learning everything we did in
the first third of the class is
optimization there's some optimization
in each of the pieces of it yeah exactly
because often we say given this training
set find me a classifier that does well
on the training set and that's an
optimization problem</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
