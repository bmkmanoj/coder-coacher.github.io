there's some other relatively lesser
less used features of ocl that i just
wanted to mention there's the concept of
tuples this is similar to what you would
do in a programming language where you
would have Struck's or records there are
friends enumerations that you see in in
java and other languages there's the
ability to express messages we haven't
gone into this much but in UML diagrams
you can express messages there's access
to the UML metamodel and there's the
concept a little weird concept of
automatic flattening say we did our
navigation and along the way we came
upon two situations two associations
which were had many participants in it
so we might end up with a set of sets or
a set of bags or something like that
Oh CL has made the decision to do
automatic flattening that says if you
have a set of sets you just get one set
you don't in your syntax have to express
two levels of access in order to get at
the contents this can make it a little
bit easier to write your expressions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
