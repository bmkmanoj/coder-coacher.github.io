about how we going to warp an image to a
different size this is a global
transformation or a global warping and
to help us we will need to start looking
at if we can come up with a set of
parameters that on easy adjustment of
these parameters we can basically take a
set of equations and generate a new
output from a given input so now we want
to actually start looking at how get an
output image G if the f is given and we
have a certain set of parameters to do
this transformation to help us let's
create a just a simple coordinate axes
here usually if you remember I always
put the coordinate axes going down in Y
and X this way just for simplicity in
consensus consistency I'm going to start
using the traditional set of axes here
of course this would be the x axis the y
axis and this would be the origin right
let's find another coordinate frame in
here so assuming this is again the
origin and this is x and y you notice
this image has been moved a little bit
let's claim that this has been
translated by D X and T why the
translations in x and y so this in
essence kind of says that now I've
translated the image so this is
basically warping or transformation of
translation now the similar example
would be when I actually take the image
again the x and y axes that we've been
paying attention to origin except that
now you notice this image has been
rotated and if you draw this axis here
you might say that this has been rotated
by a model data and that's rotation
actually now means that basically the
same pixel values that I have here now
appear in a different setup and of
course thinking hard about you might
also thinking this is basically change
the way rows and columns look and how my
pixel values are looking so this is
basically looking at simple rotations
let's look at a few additional examples
of this kind of parametric warping or
transformation of images again my input
image in this one I have stretched the
image right in essence what I've done is
I've scaled it I've added basic
additional dimension in the x axis then
I have here y and this one is of course
the same result enters of course my
is larger and in this case the height is
the same this basically where we just
change one scale parameter exchange of
the aspect of the image and of course we
could do this in both directions X and Y
and of course that's a change in the
scale of the image very simple stuff so
far another example where are basically
at the same image except this time
around if you notice that we've actually
done an interesting thing what we've
done here is we've added a little bit of
perspective projective work now the top
row is much top numbers or top part is
much smaller the bottom is larger and in
essence the image seems to have flipped
on that side a little bit this is
referred to as perspective and this of
course is an example where we have
created an F fine deformation of the
image or basically now the image seems
to have kind of have a lot more share
again different types of warps or
transformation applied to the same pixel
values and of course as you notice the
domain the number of how the x and y is
change depends on how what kind of
function we could apply so let's not
talk about what kind of functions we can
apply</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
