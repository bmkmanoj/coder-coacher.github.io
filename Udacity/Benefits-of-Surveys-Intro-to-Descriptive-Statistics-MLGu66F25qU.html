get info on a population sometimes it is
really difficult to conduct the survey
but surveys are often a lot easier than
doing say a controlled experiment
they're also relatively inexpensive they
mostly just require time to implement
and for the respondents to write their
answers surveys can also be conducted
remotely you might have gotten a survey
in the mail at one point and finally
this is my favorite thing about surveys
anyone can access and analyze survey
results if the survey owner is willing
to give out that data but assuming they
are the survey results are timeless the
National Center for Education Statistics
created this education longitudinal
study and thanks to them I was able to
look at factors that influence effort
including how much students enjoy school
or how much students value school for
their relationship with their teachers
their gender and a bunch of other things
it was really fun and interesting to
analyze this data looking at someone
else's survey results can be a lot
easier than conducting your own survey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
