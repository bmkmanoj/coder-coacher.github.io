types of primary sensors we would be
interested in looking at film versus
digital there is a long-term debate that
has been going on between film versus
digital use of either film or digital in
cameras I'm not going to get into that
religious debate to me that debate has a
similar feeling as a debate between
digital music or through vinyl
recordings we will look at both of them
film usually comes in canisters like
this you've seen different formats of
this for digital basically what we need
is some sort of a storage media here I'm
just showing you some generic forms of
flash discs that are not commonly used
in cameras I'm going to make a claim
that film and digital cameras are
practically the same for example if I
showed you this camera this large camera
here again a digit this is an SLR camera
or I showed you this camera both of them
look exactly the same both of them have
you know the shutter
they have lenses and this is a single
lens reflex camera which basically means
if I was to open this up and put this
right here you can see it has a mirror
and if the minute pops up there should
be a sensor behind it and of course the
shutter controls how the shutter would
open when the mirror is moved up and of
course the optics of the lens here are
also the same so in essence hopefully
you'll agree with me that both cameras
have pretty much the same form factor of
course you may be arguing with me that
all things are really different now for
example let's say you know I bring in a
cell phone which has a camera here this
is a complete change in thinking about
how photography is done or let's look at
for example an Instamatic kind of camera
here this of course is a digital one but
if you look at all Instamatic cameras
they pretty much had the same form
factor lens sensor which could be film
and in this case of course if you look
at it the film is not there and of
course we have is a small disc
so this whole thing basically suggests
that cameras are still alike in their
you know kind of the whole form factor
that we've seen them for a long time
they've just gotten smaller and also
have a lot more different types of
functionalities I will admit that with
the innovations there have been
significant improvements in actuators
and lenses lens quality of course in the
old days was very good and it's still
very good but the actuators the motors
that are come in are actually much
better than they ever used to be
furthermore the sensors and stuff that
we use in cameras now may not have the
same kinds of fidelity as film but of
course instant gratification we get
pictures the moment we take them and we
see them right away the bottom line with
all cameras in general is there is no
difference in how light is transported
through the lens but it's how it's
tracked and preserved so the whole
process of how it's sensed trapped and
preserved either in film or in digital
form is what's changed for film
basically there is a chemical process
for digital basically it's the
electronic process of how light energy
is converted to electronic signals which
are then saved as digital signals and
then are converted into pixels in case
of film it's a chemical process that
converts light energy and preserves it
in a format that basically can be saved
on film I had earlier already shown you
this camera that I have popped open and
it had a film it like right here
basically I know I know
it's an exposed film but basically
that's what we have in old traditional
cameras a tin frame here I'm not going
to take it out right now so here you
basically the see the film of course
exposed it but that's basically in a
canister and of course it basically goes
through as soon as I take a shot I
forward the film and I expose the next
one this is of course the film taken out
of the camera this is exposed but not
developed film after a film is exposed
in a camera you take it to a dark room
and then other chemical processes are
add
to develop to be able to get the images
out in the negative format that we have
seen before I'm sure all of you played
around with negatives and have seen them
in person so the bottom line is we have
a canister we have digital format in
form of a disc right now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
