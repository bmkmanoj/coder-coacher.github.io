in analytics remember to get to the
analytics dashboard you go to analytics
google com login if you need to and
choose your account and the analytics
dashboard opens at the app overview page
but first I want to look at the
real-time data so go to real-time and
overview pause the video now while you
go to the real-time overview right now
when you go to a screen in your app a
tracking heat is generated the analytics
service batches up tracking requests and
sends them all together at regular
intervals I'll talk more about that soon
the point here is that you might need to
wait a few minutes for the data to start
showing up in your app the data is going
to show up while there are active users
and then where nobody's using your app
it's going to disappear now let's look
at the accumulated data to do that go
back to the app overview get that by
clicking here at overview and the
overview page gives a summary of all the
data for your app notice the default
date range up here and you'll see that
it ends in not today's date but
yesterday's date so this is april 26
today's actually April the seventh so
since we want to see the data that we
got for today while we're testing we
need to change the date range so you
click on it you choose a start date and
the end date and I recommend while
you're the only one using the app and
we're working through the course just
set the date range to just be today so
go to today whichever that is for me
that seventh of April set the start date
and then the end date will automatically
be today because you can't go beyond
today and you apply the date range I
don't worry if you don't see any data
yet it might take a while for the data
to show up while we're waiting for the
data to arrive I'm going to talk a bit
about sessions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
