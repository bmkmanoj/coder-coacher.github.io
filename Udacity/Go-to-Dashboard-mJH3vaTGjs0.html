in analytics remember to get to the
analytics dashboard you go to
analytics.google.com log in if you need
to and choose your account and the
analytics dashboard opens at the app
overview page but first I want to look
at the real-time data so go to real-time
and overview pause the video now while
you go to the real-time overview right
now when you go to a screen in your app
a tracking hit is generated the analytic
service batches up tracking requests and
sends them all together at regular
intervals I'll talk more about that soon
the point here is that you might need to
wait a few minutes for the data to start
showing up in your app the data is going
to show up while there are active users
and then where nobody's using your app
it's going to disappear now let's look
at the accumulated data to do that go
back to the app overview get that by
clicking here overview and the overview
page gives a summary of all the data for
your app notice the default date range
up here and you'll see that it ends in
not today's date but yesterday's day so
this is April to 6 today's actually
April the 7th so since we want to see
the data that we got for today while
we're testing we need to change the date
range so you click on it you choose a
start date and the end date and I
recommend while you're the only one
using the app and we're working through
the course just set the date range to
just be today so go to today whichever
that is for me that's 7th of April set
the start date and then the end date
will automatically be today because you
can't go beyond today and you apply the
date range now don't worry if you don't
see any data yet it might take a while
for the data to show up while we're
waiting for the data to arrive I'm going
to talk a bit about sessions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
