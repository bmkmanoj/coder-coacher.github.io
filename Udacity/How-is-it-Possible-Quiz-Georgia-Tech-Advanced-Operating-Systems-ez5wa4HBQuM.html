and an operating system for managing the
processor and the memory I want to throw
another fun quiz at you now in this quiz
I'm gonna ask you the following question
the computer regardless of which
platform you're using seemingly runs
several programs in parallel you may
have an email program running a browser
you may have music playing maybe you're
watching a video clip and so on but
suppose it is only one CPU inside let's
assume that your computer system has
exactly one CPU inside how is it
possible that it is running several
programs in parallel I'm gonna give you
multiple choices the first choice is
even though there is only one CPU there
are multiple cores within the CPU and
there's one core for each of the
applications that you're running and
that's how we're able to run multiple
applications in parallel so that's your
first choice the second choice is I'm
trying to trick you that this is a trick
question actually there's only one app
that is running at a time and the
premise of the question itself was wrong
so that's your second choice the third
choice says that there is only one CPU
there are multiple applications but
these applications share the CPU through
the operating system so that for
different time units different
applications are running on the CPU so
for instance in time unity one
application one is running time unit T
two application two is running and so on
and this is what is making it appear as
though there are several programs
running on the CPU simultaneously what
is going on is that the operating system
is multiplexing the CPU among these
applications so these are the choices
I'm giving you and I want you to pick
what you think is the right choice</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
