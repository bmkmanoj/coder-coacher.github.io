Udacity and I'm here with Ayaka Nonaka a
tall calm Ayaka can you tell us a little
bit about yourself yeah um so I am iOS
developer at workflow
I joined just five weeks ago I guess
almost six now but before that I was at
venmo also as an iOS developer for three
years and before that I was in college
pen back in the East Coast cool
yeah workflow one design award last year
right yeah yep
yeah I can't take credit so cool yeah
what'swhat's an example of something you
would do in workflow yeah um I think the
one that I use the most is sending the
last screen shot that I took on my phone
to my computer so like as a developer
I'm always like working on things
sometimes I run my app and I find a bug
and I want to like send the unlock or
like how about my computer so I can like
send it somewhere else
so I can just be like Oh run this
workflow and send the last screen shot
to my computer and I can just do stuff
on my computer with with the screen shot
so that one's pretty useful and yeah I
think and also another cool and is like
oh can you call me an uber to the next
amount on my calendar we can do stuff
like that it's is really really fun and
you can run it from like Notification
Center so you can just like drag down
and like tap on the workflow and thanks
to have to enter the app or anything
that's no but very cool um well let's
step back a little bit and talk about
your journey as an engineer yeah how did
you get started in iOS development so
iOS development I guess it's kind of a
funny story so I before I joined Vemma
full-time and 2013 I interned at vamo in
2010 after my freshman year oh that's
when I like first took like my intro CS
class I learned it like a linked list is
and like maybe like what a hashmap is
and stuff and I was kind of scrambling
during like the spring of my freshman
year because it seemed like everyone
else in internships really like planned
something out and I was like oh I'm like
the only one with an internship so I
went to this yeah sort of speed-dating
thing and I
found memo and I got there and they're
like welcome like you're entering task
is gonna be making something cool with
the new like demo API that they're
working on they're like oh we can make
we're thinking like maybe like an iOS
app or an Android app like which one you
want to work on I was like well I guess
I have an iPhone I guess like an iOS app
so that's kind of how I decided to start
doing iOS development and they're like
yeah like it could have been Android if
I hadn't enjoyed by yeah yeah and then
since when I've been doing I was
developing on and on
Oh was that so was that the first so
that was the first iOS app you ever
worked on yeah that was like the first
like real project outside of like a
school project I've ever worked on yeah
so I didn't like start when I was like
10 I think yeah that was after college
or during college is that one and you
did you first start coding in college -
yeah for the most part I found computer
science like near the end of my high
school career I applied for this three
week program at fun which was like I
figure out what it was fast
science technology something something
yeah you know the summer program and it
was after my junior summer I applied and
he could choose like which programs
you're interested in like what's focused
areas of engineering you're interested
in so I think I actually put like
robotics as my first one because like
that's that sounds fun like robots and
everything but CSS is like my second one
and I I don't think I got into the
robotics one but I got a new son
so that's also like this is how a
certain computer science it's kind of
arbitrary but yeah I'm happy where I
ended up nice thanks so 2010 was pretty
early days for Ben mo right yeah it was
really early days I think for like
literally like five people in our like
tiny office and Philadelphia yeah it was
before yeah crazy yeah it was like all
like IKEA furniture yeah like being out
workflow right now kind of reminds me of
like the early days of that day because
we're a total of five people in our
office - oh my god our company is I
guess we're four in our office and in
five total
Wow that's tiny whereas a workflows
based in San Francisco so it's kind of
like around forth and Brandon's like
really close here neat yeah
do you like living in San Francisco so I
live in Oakland so I live right across
the bridges Barton every morning yeah I
love the Bay Area I've been in the bay
for like three years now but I'll
probably be here for a very very long
time yeah it's fun being at the center
that's the Tech Center
yeah definitely let's see do you
normally develop in Swift or objective-c
so I do both so if I'm though we started
doing like oh I still say we usually
guess it's okay now though we're doing
like 100% like a few months back and
workflow our code base is actually still
all objective-c in terms of her app but
we started writing Swift for like other
things like like automating tasks using
scripting which is what I actually gave
a talk about outcomes
yeah so we're starting with that I'm
slowly like easing into it like full-on
soft but for me I've been writing Swift
since it came out what was it like when
what was your initial reaction when they
announced it it was really exciting 2014
was the first time I actually got a
ticket to WDC so it was I was sitting in
Latino in the room and I remember like
announcing there was like this like
awkward silence of like people kind of
like gasping and like choking on their
own like breath yeah but after that
there was like a roaring applause that's
so cool yeah people were totally shocked
you're like objective-c gonna run for
like literally like 30 like three years
yeah yeah yeah so Swift is still like
two years old
objective-c is 31 years older than Swift
crazy crazy is there one that you prefer
or I guess so you're sort of switching
between the two Francis
what's that like ah at first like when I
started at workflow like my brain was
used to Swift so it was kind of
difficult but like after a few hours I
was like okay like I remember how
scissors yeah but I prefer Swift but I
think like a lot of existing apps have
objective-c and like we have to like
learn to work with it too is if we can
start using Swift and a lot of the new
features that were announced in Swift
like 43.0 and even like Swift - or with
the respect to like backwards
compatibility with objective-c so I
think Apple knows that in order to get
more people on Swift like we need to
make sure that it's very compatible with
existing objective-c apps so yeah
existing apps can start adopting it and
so can really the entire community along
as opposed to just like people who are
writing new apps that are like good yeah
that are so small and like have no
objective-c
yeah we don't want to leave the the
objective-c app yeah exactly there are a
lot of that have been around for a while
like Facebook I think is like all object
all objective-c still but Lily yeah at
least the mean up but like I'm sure like
will eventually get on says long let's
talk a little more about about your talk
see you you presented some really
interesting a really interesting
solution to some common localization
challenges can you talk a little more
about that yeah so the one of the first
projects I started working on when I
joined workflow was localization because
this is something that we've been
wanting to do for a very long time and I
guess like big our team hasn't really
had like enough people a lot of the
teams they like take on like
localization and I'm like
internationalization and all that so I
started working on that oh there's this
command called genstrings that we can
use to like generate the localization
stringing file but for us like there are
some quirks that made that and
compatible incompatible with what we
wanted to do so you're like okay I guess
you have to like write your own script I
was like oh like we can do it inside
nice yeah like God memo we did something
similar for I think generating code for
image assets
and so I was like oh we can do like this
localizations thing and also like Swift
as well so yeah yeah it's like a kind of
a good scripting is a nice way to
introduce your team to Swift without
having to add Swift code to your app
itself because I think a lot of big apps
of concerns because like a bi-stability
and like yeah your app binary size is
gonna increase and all those sorts of
like other issues that we might face so
it's a nice way to add Swift and get
your team like used to it without having
to like go like full in yeah it's like
easier when it there was a really funny
example in your talk where where you're
you were showing how the Japanese word
chotto gets translated and it sort of to
me it was a really good example of how
it's hard to deal with these cases in
which the literal translation differs
from the translation in context and it's
kind of hard to preserve that context in
an app or when you're writing
localization code so how do you do that
how do you preserve context yeah yeah so
so chapter I was like an example I'm
like I just spoke in Japanese but in our
app there when we had our translators
start translating translating some of
the strings that we extracted out of her
app there is a sword slack in our code
base in our app and some of the
translators started translating it
literally to like slack on a rope even
though we wanted it to just be like
slack as in like the applet everyone
uses to talk to each other yeah yeah one
lesson that we learned there was even if
it seems like obvious to us but it's
like socks app we need to make sure we
provide that context in our localization
strings right when you put it in like a
comment yeah exactly
property do you think of yourself as
having a specialty within iOS or are
there certain kind of problems that you
find yourself naturally drawn toward oh
I think I keep kind of like changing so
the scripting example that I gave in the
talk I used to be completely like
uncomfortable with scripting because I
associated with it would like languages
that I wasn't familiar with like Ruby
and like I thought I did in school but
like I wasn't that comfortable with it
and a lot of scripts are written in
baskets is like really scary looking to
me yeah but as it came out like I think
because Swift can be used for like so
many different things it's been kind of
like pushing me out of like my comfort
zone like beyond just like oh like UI
programming and also like like modeling
things out like in the codebase but yeah
it's it's been great I'm hoping that
like because Swift is available or it's
people are starting to write Swift for
like back-end code to like back-end code
is something that I'm also not
comfortable with I'm hoping that it will
like make me branch out like other stuff
too like maybe like front-end what web
development is left yeah so I feel like
I do have specialties but I want to like
branch out and so if there's been like a
great way to branch out nice yeah it's
so cool but you know you can love a
language and then all of a sudden you
find yourself doing these things you
discover like all these like different
aspects of engineering but I've never
done before
yeah all right we have some questions
from students
this one's from Jeremy Beasley he's in
our beginning iOS the ANA degree so he's
a true beginner and he asks when during
the design and development process would
you recommend someone consider
localization of an app at the beginning
the end or throughout the entire process
I'd say throughout the entire process I
think every time you add a user facing
string it's nice to be like oh I should
make this a NS localized string because
odd as someone who just joined a new
team and a new project five weeks ago is
really hard so we actually didn't label
any of any of our user facing strings as
NS localized strings says literally
going through the entire project trying
to figure out like which ones are user
facing as opposed to League Witten's or
like identifier Zoar like your all's
like things that shouldn't be localized
so I think it's just easy to just do it
as you do as you go it's kind of like
picking up trashes together but except
me more positive and so you basically
had to go through every string
in the app and analyze whether it was
user facing her yeah and I oftentimes
don't really have to ask the rest of the
team like hey like it's a user facing
like is it gonna break things if I
change it so yeah like as you add string
stuff it's probably the best way to do
it because it's so fast to just like at
it yeah you just wrap the string and
eyeness local string and it becomes so
much easier and then that's like the
internationalization part to like make
it look wise Abul but in terms of like
actually localizing and translating the
string itself I think that can wait
until like later when you like need to
do it like when you actually want to go
international and trance art translating
so I think that partly depends on like
like what your situation is with like
your app it's like if it's like really
successful and you want to take it to
like different countries or maybe it's
like not that successful and you want to
like finally different markets for it
like maybe that's when you want to start
like actually localizing and translating
but in terms of like marking your
strings as localized strings I would say
as you go yeah and I guess your
translation strategy is probably going
to differ based on what countries
exactly yep your market includes yeah
can you talk a little bit about the
difference between internationalization
and localization definitely yeah I
confuse the two terms as well but
internationalization means getting your
like app ready for translation basically
so for example like things like marking
your strings as localized strings or
making sure like you handle like
different like units of measurement or
maybe your UI should support like
right-to-left languages as well that's
also in translation
I guess that's also kind of localization
but but the localization part is usually
like the actual translation and the
active translating all the strings
different languages what tool do you
guys use for translation oh we use this
called crowd in and it's really cool of
because they provide this really easy to
use like - word for you to collaborate
with translators if someone's confused
they can link start like a little like
chat like dialog thing so you can be
like oh like what's the slack thing
that's the app not League
no other things yeah and what's cool
about that platform is is that there's
the also I forgot what the feature is
called but they let you like kind of
like open-source you're a translation so
you can like host like a website with
like the translation dashboard and you
can literally have like users just like
crowdsourcing and starting to translate
your strings and you can have someone
that like actually approves the
translations but that would be super
useful since you know things like cancel
and done and then delete and all those a
common actions would be just take a pair
of immediately I'm for like native
speakers like even like the longer
paragraphs are easy for them to
translate so like maybe they're bored
and one translate like one string like
you have a lot of like users who just
want to like do like a little bit of
translation you know you'll end up with
like a lot of translation this is
awesome
so cool let's say we have another
student question
this one's from Leo Leo's in our iOS
nanodegree um and he says how do you
step out of a rut I've been working on a
bug for the past three days I've done
all that I can think to fix it but it
still won't work I feel like I need a
different approach to tackle this
problem has something similar ever
happened to you yeah definitely
sometimes I'm working on a bog and it
was like nothing is working what I
usually do is I go online or like try to
find someone who might be able to answer
my question and sometimes like even if
they can't answer it directly like
they'll like say the right words there's
something to like trigger like another
idea in your minds I think like going
outside of just like you're like you and
your work station and like talking to
other people or like reaching out to
like people on Twitter or maybe Stack
Overflow like that usually helps really
nice yeah nice yeah and if even if
somebody doesn't have the exact answer
you're looking yeah it's still gonna be
useful or just like talk to someone like
the rubber duck yeah have you done it
have you talked to the rubber duck oh
not to like a actual
but like - yeah it's like teammates like
me like said listen to me for a little
bit okay so that's all the student
questions a lot of our students are true
beginners they've never they know this
is their very first programming language
is swift do you think Swift is a good
programming language for total beginners
yeah also the thing that excited me most
at the keynote was the Swift playgrounds
for iPad and on the way here today on
the BART I'm trained I was like coding
something on my iPad that like let me
drag around like a swift bird logo I've
had and like like it's like drawing a
circle that's like draggable and stuff
so I think if I can see that like apples
really pushing for like the educational
aspect of Swift and people are starting
to write books that are instead of paper
books they're like Interactive's with
playgrounds and like I honestly like
wish Swift for my first programming
language so I could I could have learned
like programming on my ipod instead of
like like boring sorting algorithms I'm
like the whiteboard or like index cards
when it's cool like so yeah yeah the
graphics they're so cool interactivity
is like coding keyboard it's available
on like the developer portal so anyone
with a developer account you can just go
there and get it install their iPad so I
think I recommend like anyone and
everyone to try it out if they can yeah
I wanna yeah I wanted my little cousins
- I've had minis aren't like too
expensive - so I think it's awesome like
getting a MacBook is like really pricey
and like an investment and honestly I
think if I weren't like a developer like
I wouldn't even own a laptop I would
just use a lot I've had so cool well
thank you so much Ayaka
that's all the time we have but it was
so cool getting the chance to talk to
you and getting a chance to see your
talk thank you thanks for having me
thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
