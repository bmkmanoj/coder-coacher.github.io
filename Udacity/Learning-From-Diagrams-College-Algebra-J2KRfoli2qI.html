drew earlier works the circle
representing the natural numbers is
within the circle representing the whole
numbers showing that the natural numbers
are all included in the whole numbers if
we pick any number we can point to which
category or categories it fits into by
pointing somewhere on this diagram for
example if I pick 18 then 18 is a
natural number so we can point here but
since that circle is inside of the whole
number circle we know that 18 is also a
whole number if we pick 0 however we can
only point to the whole number circle
not the natural number circle since 0 is
whole but not natural and if I pick a
number like 16.5 well that is not in
either of these categories so we would
need to point outside of both of these
circles so you can see that we're
building up this sort of world of
numbers and we're going to keep adding
more to it next we're going to talk
about integers which if we represent
them in our world of numbers here would
be drawn as a circle around the whole
numbers like this even though I haven't
told you anything about integers yet can
you tell me just by looking at this
diagram which of the following
statements are true</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
