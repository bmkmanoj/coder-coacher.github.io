what an outlier is let's take a look at
one through an example here we have some
income data that spread out in the
histogram to show how the values are
distributed it's apparent that most of
the values representing people's income
are within the zero to one hundred
thousand range but there's one value
someone making a million dollars that we
can see out here on the right that might
fit with what we've described as extreme
or abnormal or a great distance for most
of the values in the data set and if we
think about it one instance of a report
of 1 million dollar income compared to
40 other values that are from zero to a
hundred thousand is really quite
abnormal we could probably consider this
an outlier but what if that single value
was only two hundred thousand and it
looked like this it is far to the right
and seems to be extreme but two hundred
thousand compared to the range of 0 to
100 thousand isn't quite that extreme so
is it an outlier it actually may not
matter whether or not we label a point
as an outlier what does matter is that
we identify extreme data points and
understand how they impact our results</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
