replica sets each deployment is map-21
active replica set used qct I'll get
replicas command to view the current set
of replicas replica sets are scaled to
the deployment for each service and can
be scaled independently as mentioned
before the real strength to communities
coming you working and declared away
instead of using imperative to scale and
expose commands let me show you how to
scale the front and deployment using the
existing deployment configuration file
first let's see how many of our hello
pods are running currently we only have
one will change that by updating the
replicas field of our deployment
manifest they will apply the change now
we look at our replica set we can see
information about what's happening
the desired number of replicas was
updated i can use the gate pods command
to watch the pods come online will see
the correct number of pods here now we
can check that the deployment updated to
the correct number of replicas
yep looks like we now have three
replicas that the deployment is managing
and we can still hit our endpoint like
before
at this point we now have multiple
copies of our hello service running in
Coober Nettie's and we have a single
friend service that's proximal traffic
to all three pots
this allows us to share the load and
scale our containers and communities</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
