especially when you're learning to
program that you have a piece of code on
the page and it doesn't work and you
read it and you study it and you don't
see what's wrong and then it often helps
in practice to just explain the code to
somebody else and sometimes just hearing
your say it out loud you'll go oh I know
what I did wrong just explaining what's
not working or why and it's such a
common technique that there's I think
there's a computer center at one of the
universities they had a teddy bear on
the desk at the helpdesk and before you
are allowed to talk to someone an actual
person you had to explain your problem
to the teddy bear because chances were
just saying it out loud to the teddy
bear would show you what was wrong with
your program the more you like something
the more you'll naturally want to do it
so I would say do not force yourself to
do something because other people are
doing it so if everyone are a bunch of
people are talking about mobile
programming or functional programming
languages or lisp or front-end
programming if you try it and you don't
like it you should not try to force
yourself to do that in the end good code
is code that other people can come and
change and adapt well I wasn't quite
that ambitious I initially just thought
that I needed another programming
language I definitely meant it to be a
general-purpose language ABC was
actually it was sort of it had multiple
philosophies it wanted to be easy to
teach and easy to learn but it also
wanted to be a language that was useful
for just slightly non-professional
computer users so I just liked a lot of
things in the ABC language as a
professional programmer and I started
copying those ideas and sort of changing
them mutating the ideas and the sort of
the details of the language and the
implementation back when I joined it was
the 152 version so it had been already
growing pretty pragmatically for a while
it was still in a phase of a tumult of
new ideas and a general attitude in this
small group of core committer Soph hey
one more feature how could it hurt
at some point essentially moving towards
the 2.0 release a sobering sense that
Python wasn't a toy language used by
people for their own fun anymore it was
starting to become the material to build
in very complex important software
system in the process of designing
Python 3 we did actually as that sort of
the core Python developer group we did a
lot of soul-searching and thinking about
which parts of the language or which and
which parts of the library can we
improve using def to introduce a
function what does that mean define
define what unfortunately I have to
admit that JavaScript has it right here
the proper keyword to introduce a
function is function why use yes to save
for letters that's not the Python spirit</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
