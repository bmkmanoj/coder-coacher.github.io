it's not particularly deep just two
layers you can make it bigger more
complex by increasing the size of that
hidden layer in the middle but it turns
out that increasing this H is not
particularly efficient in general you
need to make it very very big and then
it gets really hard to Train this is
where the central idea of deep learning
comes into play
instead you can also add more layers and
make your model deeper there are lots of
good reasons to do that one is parameter
efficiency you can typically get much
more performance with fewer parameters
by going deeper rather than wider
another one is that a lot of natural
phenomena that you might be interested
in tend to have a yahiko structure which
deep models naturally capture if you
poke at a model for images for example
and visualize what the model learns
you'll often find very simple things at
the lowest layers like lines or edges
once you move up you tend to see more
complicated things like geometric shapes
go further up and you start seeing
things like objects faces this is very
powerful because the model structure
matches the kind of abstractions that
you might expect to see in your data and
as a result the model has an easier time
learning them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
