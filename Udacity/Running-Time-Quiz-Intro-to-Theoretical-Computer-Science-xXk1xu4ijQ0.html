running time of another algorithm using
Big O notation so this is the algorithm
that we're going to look at it's just
four lines and actually the algorithm
doesn't perform any very useful function
the most important part is that it's
interesting to analyze its running time
so there's not really any value in or at
least none that I can see of actually
producing this result down here so what
I would like you to do is to figure out
the running time as a function of this
value n here and I'm going to give you a
number of choices for your answer so the
first choice is o of n so it would be a
linear algorithm the second one is o of
n to the power of 1.5 next one is o of N
squared and the final one is o of n to
the power of three so I want you to
check the box that states the correct
running time of this algorithm expressed
as a function of N and I'm also going to
give you a little hint which is that if
you add n plus n minus 1 plus n minus 2
and so on plus 2 plus 1 that is equal to
N squared plus n over 2 and once you
analyze the algorithm you will see that
this hint is actually quite useful</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
