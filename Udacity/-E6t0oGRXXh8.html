solve problems solving problems is one
of the most important skills you can
learn and calling a skill is really an
understatement nearly everything you can
do can be viewed as solving problems and
improving as a problem solver is a
lifelong challenge one short lesson is
not going to be enough to make anyone an
expert problem solver but for this
lesson we're going to look at some
aspects of how to approach more
complicated programming problems and
hopefully that will help you in solving
any problem that you're faced with from
now on but it doesn't really make sense
to talk about solving problems without
thinking about particular problems so
we're going to look at a specific
practice problem and talk about how I
would go about solving that and our goal
by looking at a particular problem is
not just to solve that particular
problem but to draw some general lessons
about how it can get better as problem
solvers in general</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
