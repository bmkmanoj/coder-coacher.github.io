that puts very explicit emphasis on the
interaction and collaboration among
people during the learning process it
was a derived from albert bandura's work
and just like Jean Piaget suggested that
authentic experiences are really
important for developing a real
understanding instructing a real
understanding of some topic bendera
suggested that part of that authenticity
is the authentic social interactions
that happen during learning that we
learned together and we develop our
concepts of different material together
and it's really important to preserve
that in any learning environment but
this presents a real problem for online
learning because in online learning we
lose the most accessible device for
facilitating this kind of social
learning and that's the physical
classroom in a physical classroom we can
actually talk to one another interact
face-to-face online we don't have that
as much so how do we develop that for
the online environment so this really
brings up two questions first of all how
does the loss of that physical
environment that physical classroom
impact online learning how does it
change what students learn does it
actually hurt us and secondly how do we
develop devices develop technologies
that can actually resolve this issue
assuming that it does damage learning if
we don't have access to this kind of
interpersonal collaboration and
interaction can we develop devices to
actually help alleviate that that
facilitate that interaction online now
I'm obviously very biased because I work
on this program and I love this program
I think there was technology not only
can we develop ways to overcome this
difficulty honestly I think in the
online environment we can develop
technologies to make it even better one
of my favorite experiences in this
program has been that I can log on to
with the class forum and interact with
10 students in five minutes and then
come back an hour later and do it again
and that's a level of interaction a
level of collaboration that I could
never have in a physical classroom and
so I really think that with the right
effort the right designs we can create
and leverage social learning in a way
online that actually goes beyond what we
could do in person</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
