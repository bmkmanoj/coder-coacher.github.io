defined as values from zero to one zero
zero zero is black one one one is white
setting just the red channel gives red
green to green and blue to blue where
things go off the tracks for some people
is when we set a color as follows
RGB of one one and zero this is to make
a color using the red and green channels
at their maximum and with no blue if I
take red paint and green paint and mix
them together I get it best a murky
Brown this happens because paint colors
are formed by absorption of various
wavelengths of light the color model for
mixing paints and inks is called
subtractive color the three primary
colors used in printing are cyan magenta
and yellow with black added as its own
dark ink this printing system is called
CMYK with K standing for ki and
essentially meaning black as different
colors are mixed the pigments become
darker overall in computer graphics a
monitor such as this one emits light of
different wavelengths our eyes see light
and wavelengths between 390 and 750
nanometers longer wavelength light is
red
shorter is blue with the rainbow in
between if we specify some red and some
green light then these contributions are
added together giving a brighter color
overall this color model is called
additive color see the additional course
materials for more articles about this
area if you want a particular color the
additive color RGB values are what
you'll need to determine to get familiar
with this way of mixing colors try out
the demo that follows</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
