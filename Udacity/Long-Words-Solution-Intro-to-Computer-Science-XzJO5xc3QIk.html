we'll see why in a minute first I want
to mention that all of these are sort of
real words it's not that will define
what it means for something be a word
the first one is the longest word used
by Shakespeare this is 27 letters long
and it means roughly with honor the
second one is one letter longer it means
the movement against the division of
church and state the third one which is
35 letters long means fear of long words
you can see it's made up of phobia which
is fear and a really big sort of made up
route about things being big and words
so it's fear of long words the fourth
one is the longest word in most large
dictionaries it's a kind of lung disease
that you get from having contact with
volcanic particles so the reason to
answer is none of the above is that I'm
very confident whatever you claim is the
longest word I can always make a bigger
one there's no such thing as the longest
word in the English language</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
