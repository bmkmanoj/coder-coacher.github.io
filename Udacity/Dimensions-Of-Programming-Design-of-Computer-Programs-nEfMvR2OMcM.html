solve just one specific puzzle but they
exist in an environment they occupy a
niche in an environment that evolves
over time and we can plot the program's
evolution through a multi-dimensional
space and we can think of the different
axes in along this space and one of the
most important axes is correctness as
the program do the right thing another
axis is efficiency does it do it fast
enough another axis is features what
exactly does it do and another one is
elegance and I'm using the word elegance
here coming from Richard or Keith a
programmer who said elegance is not
optional and elegance encompasses a
number of attributes or as their some
call times called Eddie's that is things
that end in ity like clarity simplicity
and generality are all part of elegance
so we can think of our program as
occupying a point in this
multi-dimensional space and we'd really
like it to be over here on the right
where the correctness is high although
correctness doesn't have to be 100% we
all use programs that crash occasionally
and the programs are still useful to us
and then over time the program evolves
and moves in some of these directions if
the program is too slow then we have to
move it up along the efficiency
direction so we have to re are connect
it and move it up to make it faster over
time we want to add more features to our
program so say we want to for a poker
program we want to deal with wild cards
or we want to deal with having to deal
with ties and so we move out along the
feature dimension and move that program
to a new space and then sometimes we
think about moving the program to a new
point in the space of elegance so moving
along the elegance dimension without
increasing the correctness or features
or efficiency and in some sense you
might think well that's not really doing
anything elegance
changing the elegance isn't gaining you
any of these features but what it is
gaining you is nothing right now but
it's gaining you something for the
future a program that is more elegant
it's easier to maintain easier to change
and so what you're doing is you're
behind time in the future by making the
program easier to maintain today now
when I think of a point in this
multi-dimensional space you know here we
have correctness and we're up against
the right edge but maybe not quite all
the way to the right edge and similarly
with all these other features no
Voltaire was not a programmer but he
gave some very good advice to
programmers and engineers he said the
best is the enemy of the good
and so what Voltaire meant by this is if
you're striving for perfection then you
may may waste too much time you make me
make a bad engineering trade-off to say
I'm gonna have to get to 100%
correctness and I'm gonna spend so much
time doing that when I could have been
doing something else I could have been
adding more features or adding other
attributes to the program so you have to
learn to be a good engineer and make
good trade-offs for any change you make
in this multi-dimensional space any any
improvement you make in any of the
dimensions there's a benefit to that you
make the program more correct or more
feature full or more efficient but
there's also a cost it takes you time to
do that and you have to learn to make
the right trade-offs and say what do I
need most which direction do I need to
move or am I done do I not have to move
