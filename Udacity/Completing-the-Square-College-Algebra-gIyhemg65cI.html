process we just went through in
transforming this equation since they
were aiming for having a perfect square
at the end on the right hand side of the
equation involving X and a constant we
know that the initial constant we
started out with couldn't be right
since right now we can't factor x
squared minus 8x plus 15 to be in this
form that means we need a different
constant attached to the two terms with
X in them so the first step was to get
rid of the initial constant we had that
we could have a different constant on
the end of the x squared minus 8x we
figured out the constant that belonged
at the end of those two terms with 16
when we add 16 to this we get the
perfect square of a binomial this
process is called completing the square
since the constant that we add on over
here ends up giving us a squared
expression as our answer now we don't
technically have to move the 15 away
from the right hand side to do this but
I think that it makes dealing with these
two terms on their own a little bit
easier since we don't have anything else
to look at on the right side so
completing the square is a crucial part
of transforming equations of parabolas
from standard form into the form where
we can see the vertex now that we
understand how to complete the square
and the importance of the technique in
transforming equations from one form to
another
I'd like you to rewrite the equation y
equals x squared plus 5x plus 6 in the
form that we've been talking about now
if your numbers get a little bit messy
in here
don't worry that doesn't mean you're
doing the problem wrong that often
happens in math so just go with it and
then at the end you can always check
your answer by plugging in points to the
equation that you start with and the
equation that you end with to make sure
that they're the same</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
