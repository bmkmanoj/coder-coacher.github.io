for case based reasoning we have looked
at adaptation a little bit let's now
look at evaluation the adaptation step
has now given us a candidate solution
the evaluation step is concerned with
how to assess the suitability of that
candidate solution to the problem at
hand so one method of doing evaluation
of a case based solution is through
simulation consider the problem going
from honey home to the restaurant case
based reasoning proposed a candidate
solution in order to find out what the
solution actually works I can do a
simulation I can even do an execution in
the world in this case we might find out
its solution actually works and we might
accept the solution now consider an
alternative problem this time we have to
go from the restaurant to the home and
we decided we'll simply flip all the
turns but as we execute the solution we
find out that some of the terms are only
one way now this particular solution
fails and this particular domain the
cost of executing a solution may be low
therefore we can just go ahead and
execute it and other domains the cost of
execution may in fact be quite high and
the best we can do is to first simulate
it before we decide to execute so
evaluation is built very closely into
our programming example every time we
you run a program and see whether or not
it worked
we're in fact evaluating whether or not
our adaptation successfully solved our
new problem when it didn't we returned
to the adaptation phase and we try again
or we might return to the retrieval
phase and retrieve another case to use
to inform our solution design majority
we can simulate our design or we can
actually prototype a design another
method for evaluating a design could be
to share it with other designers and let
them critique it
so there are a number of different
methods that are possible for evaluation
as well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
