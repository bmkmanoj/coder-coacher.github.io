learning problem based learning is a
constructionist learning strategy where
the learning process is really motivated
by some central organizing problem now
when we say problem here we're not
really talking about something small
like a little math problem we're talking
about something a little bit bigger and
a little bit more open-ended so in
ecology we might have the problem of
figuring out why a certain species went
extinct or in medicine we might have the
problem of given some symptoms and given
some family history let's diagnosed as
patient so there are these central
motivating problems behind the learning
process the power of problem-based
learning is that it really teaches
students at two different levels on the
one hand it teaches them the content
knowledge that they need to know to
diagnose that disease you would need to
know a list of diseases you need to know
which symptoms correspond to which
diseases so there's content knowledge at
play but problem-based learning doesn't
just teach the content knowledge it also
teaches that content knowledge in the
context of how would actually be used in
the real world so in the ecology example
it's one thing to know the biological
principles and the genetics and things
like that they go into that organism but
it's something else to understand the
overall idea of constructing an
explanation of what happened in that
system evaluating that explanation
against evidence and revising it
accordingly so the power of
problem-based learning is it not only
teaches students content knowledge but
it teaches them content knowledge in the
context of how it would be used out in
the real world and this is very
motivating for students as well they get
to see that if I went into a career in
this this is actually what I would be
doing this isn't just a material that's
been whitewashed to use in a classroom
environment this is actually what people
do in the real world when they work in
these fields so it's a great way of
motivating learning and it's also a
great way of teaching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
