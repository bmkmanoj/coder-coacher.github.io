we're eroding with a disc circular disc
with the origin in the middle okay so
this is the original image we saw this
one before and if we rode with a disc of
radius 5 you can see that what's going
to happen is first of all all of these
lines that are thin they all go away why
do they go away they're thinner
obviously than the size 50 X its radius
5 so the thinner than size 10 all right
and so none of there's no place you can
put that disk down and have the pixel
survive obviously there's one stretch
here that's thick enough and so that
lead survives so I make the radius
bigger this thing they all go away and
if I made the radius even bigger yet
what happens is all these leads go away
and also you notice this square is
shrinking by that amount because the
only place that you can hit that inside
there is at this level and so it's going
to pull away from the edges so that's
erosion now as you saw dilation fills
holes and stuff but it grows your
picture erosion removes little things
you might not want there but it shrinks
your picture I don't really want to grow
or shrink my cells I just want to
disconnect them not not my cells the
cells in the picture so I don't really
want the things to get bigger or smaller
I just want to clean them up well so
that should make you think probably I
could do some eroding followed by some
dilating or some dilating followed by
some eroding and you'd be exactly right
and those two operations are referred to
as opening and closing and I say here
the two most useful binary morphology
operations that is just one man's
opinion my humble well okay my not so
humble opinion that that's probably the
most important thing the only reason I
say its most important is in many
systems that I've worked on at down and
in the guts somewhere we're doing some
opening and closing just to clean up our
binary images a little bit</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
