panda population ended up as an
endangered species and that was because
their population declined to a
dangerously low number more pandas were
dying each year than being born since
they had lost huge portions of their
habitat making food and meats difficult
to find now even though glorious giant
panda preserve is doing very well
rehabilitating its population pandas are
actually still endangered worldwide
preserves like hers are one of the ways
that hopefully pandas will no longer be
endangered anymore someday their overall
population will one day get to a much
healthier size which of these statements
I've just written do you think makes the
most sense in terms of the decline of
the panda population a constant number
of pandas diet each year the larger the
population the more pandas died each
year and the smaller the population the
fewer die each year or finally the
larger the population the fewer pandas
died each year and the smaller the
population the more died each year</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
