formula can be transformed into a graph
such that this graph has a large clique
in that case only if the boolean formula
has a satisfying assignment and here's
one fact that's going to make our life a
little bit easier every boolean formula
can be written like this so you have the
brackets around variables that are only
combined by ORS so you have variable 1
or variable 2 or variable 3 and you can
have more than three variables in here
but you have nothing else you only have
variables and ORS and between the
brackets you always have an end so you
have bracket of ORS and bracket of ORS
and so on this is known as the
conjunctive normal form of a boolean
formula and it can be shown that you can
write any boolean formula no matter how
complex in this form here and it will
not significantly change the size of the
formula so if you have n variables and
your boolean formula has size polynomial
in n it will stay that way if you
transform it into the conjunctive normal
form and if you have conjunctive normal
form then this part here and the
brackets is known as a clause so this
this year would also be a clause and
what you can see is the way that this is
structured the boolean formula if it has
a satisfying assignment then each of
these clauses needs to evaluate to true
because they're all connected by an end
so if one of these would evaluate to
false then the whole formula would not
be satisfied now how are we going to
transform this into clique so I'm just
going to show you how to transform a
boolean formula that is written in this
form into a graph and then we'll discuss
what this has to do with clique</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
