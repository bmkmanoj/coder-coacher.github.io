and return back to propositional logic
recall that we had found ways of writing
sentences in propositional logic we had
found rules of inferences we could prove
theorems we could find the truth value
of new sentences however we founded
those methods were computationally not
very efficient so AI has developed more
efficient methods one of those methods
is called resolution theorem proving let
us take an example to illustrate how
resolution theorem proving works so
imagine there is a robot and this robot
is working on an assembly line it's a
factory robot and on the assembly line
are coming weight as kind of widgets the
robots task is to pick up each widget as
it comes on the assembly line and put it
in a truck however there are some humans
in this factory who play a joke on you
to a bot once in a while they glue the
widget to the assembly line belt so that
when the robot tries to move it it
cannot move it but the robot is a smart
robot this is a logical agent so when it
cannot move it it uses its logical
reasoning to figure out that the box is
not liftable in the moment it knows that
the box is not liftable it lets go of
the box it moves on to the next one
everyone got the story alright so let us
suppose that a robot begins with some
knowledge in its knowledge base and this
knowledge in its knowledge base that it
begins with says that if cannot move
then it implies that not liftable now it
tries to move the box the next box on
the widget its percepts turret it cannot
move it needs to prove that it's not
liftable of course this is a trivial
example i am sure you all understand it
you could potentially apply simply modus
ponens to prove that it's not liftable
if P then Q P therefore you can infer Q
but we'll use this example to show how
resolution theorem proving works
so the first step in resolutions you're
improving is to convert every sentence
into a conjunctive normal form a
conjunctive normal form of a sentence
can have two one of three conditions it
can have a literal that can be either a
positive atom or a negative Adam it can
have disjunction of literals like here
can move or not liftable or it can have
a conjunction of disjunction of literals
in this example the third condition does
it occur so the first thing we must do
is to take the first sentence the
negation of not move implies not
liftable and remove the implication
because an implication cannot occur it
conjunctive normal form so the first
thing we need to do is to rewrite the
sentence the first sentence to remove
the implication because implication
cannot occur in a conjunctive normal
form so now we use the implication
elimination rewriterule to rewrite this
in the form of can move or not liftable
remember that was alpha implies beta
becomes not alpha or beta so the knot of
negation of can move becomes can move or
not liftable so we have done it for the
first sentence this is now in a
conjunctive normal form we can do the
same thing for the second sentence but
wait the second centers already is in a
conjunctive normal form we don't have to
do anything now the robot wants to prove
that that box is not liftable resolution
theorem proving is like proof by
refutation to do proof verification
we'll take the negation of what we want
to prove we wanted to prove not liftable
will take us negation which makes it
liftable okay so now we got three
sentences this was the first sentence
that the robot was bootstrapped with
you've just converted into a conjunctive
normal form this was his sentence that
came from as percept it's saw that the
box cannot move and this is this
sentence rather the negation at the
center is a refutation at the center
that it wants to prove so we have three
sentences now the first sentence came
from the bootstrapping of the robots
knowledge base this is the egg
the robot assumes to be true the second
sentence came from its perception robot
tried to move the box it could not move
it the third sentence is coming from
taking the negation of what the robot
wants to prove it wants to prove it's
not liftable so it is going to take the
negation of it and then show that it's
going to lead to a null condition that
will view as a contradiction a
resolution theorem proving you always
begin with a literal in this sentence
that we want to prove so here that
sentence is liftable and we look for a
sentence that contains the negation
awful little in this sentence that we
want to prove so the sentence here was
liftable send as s 1 contains a literal
which is a negation of that so he picks
s 1 and not as to note how efficient it
was to decide which sentence of the
knowledge base to go to in sentence
container negation of the literal soul
if table and not liftable cannot both be
true we know that and therefore we can
eliminate them this is called resolution
we resolve on liftable and we remove
them from the sentences now we were a
sentence s one that leaves us with can
move so now we pick a sentence that has
the negation of the literal can move
sentence s2 has a negation of that and
we can resolve one can move they cannot
both be true when we resolve on both of
them those get a limited as well and now
we see with regional condition this nut
condition represents a contradiction and
now we can infer that liftable cannot be
true therefore not liftable is true the
robot has proved not liftable in this
case it appears as the resolutions
you're improving is more complex as
modus ponens in general it is not it
just appears here because this condition
happened to fulfill the form of modus
ponens directly in journal designing out
with sentence to apply the modus ponens
on and how to combine those rules of
inferences turns out to be
computationally harder than deciding how
to apply two solutions here improving</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
