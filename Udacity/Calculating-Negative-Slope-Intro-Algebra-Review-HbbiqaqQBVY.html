negative slope and see how we can
calculate its value first I'm going to
find two points that the line seems to
really go through and not here the line
just passes close but doesn't go through
it same with here up it goes through
this point and it looks like that point
has coordinates negative 32 I could also
use the point 0 0 but I don't really
want to let's use a different one nope
nope this one and looks like that we has
coordinates 3 negative 2 now when I
think of how the line changes between
these points well vertically when i'm
calculating the rise it changes by well
negative for it goes down for and the
run well it's still going to the right
so i'm going to call that a positive
number and it looks like it's six so if
i were to calculate the slope I would
get rise negative four over run six and
that simplifies to negative 2 over 3 now
time for you to practice so can you tell
me what's the slope of this line enter
your intern these boxes rise over run</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
