living in groups and the social
influence of others and we're going to
do so by breaking the lesson into three
sections in the first section we're
going to look at forces that change our
behavior and this includes social
facilitation and social loafing as well
as conformity and obedience in the
second part of the lesson we're going to
look at social forces that change our
perception and attitudes towards others
and this includes social perception
theory and attribution theory as well as
inclusion and exclusion prejudice and
discrimination as well as our attitudes
and our behaviors and then finally in
the third section we're going to look at
how we act towards others and this
includes aggressiveness and pro-social
behavior as well as who we like
attraction and what love is but let's
get started with social forces I
remember back in junior high school one
of my friends was having a party
everybody was talking about the
invitations that they got what they were
going to wear to the party how exciting
was going to be and given the I had been
invited to parties in this group of
friends in the past I assume that I
would be invited to this one as well
however it turns out that I realized
quite quickly I was not invited to this
party and I remember feeling a pit in my
stomach I was angry I was sad I was
envious at most of all I felt pain I had
just experienced my first harsh
encounter with social rejection</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
