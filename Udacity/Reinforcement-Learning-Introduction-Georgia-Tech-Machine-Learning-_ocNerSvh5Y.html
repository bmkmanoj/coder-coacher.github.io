is going quite well thank you very much
for asking how are things going with you
I can't complain because I've been
barred by a judge I'm pretty sure you
can still complain complaining is a fine
art that requires lots of practice guess
what we're going to do today I'm reading
decision making and reinforcement
learning which is very exciting this at
the - yeah except for the - yeah the -
Tron why because it's not decision -
making you're right I normally don't do
that but people always want to put a -
so what I'm going to do is for you
Michael just for you I'm gonna remove
the - thank you and I'm gonna put it
over here where it belongs there well
Michael this is the first of our
discussions on the last mini course of
machine learning reinforcement learning
which I believe you know a little bit
about I am very interested in
reinforcement learning
excellent so I'm just going to do a
little bit of background it's going to
be relatively short and straightforward
I'm gonna do a couple of quizzes because
I know how much you like quizzes and
then we're just going to go back and
forth and see what we get to learn about
reinforcement learning so I'm good
excellent excellent okay so let's get
started</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
