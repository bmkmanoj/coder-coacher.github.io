going to help to have another definition
that I haven't given you yet so here's a
graph we've been talking about things
like shortest paths so let's look at a
path from A to G so here's a natural
path to choose it's one of the shortest
paths from A to G but it's by no means
the only path from A to G so here's
another path from A to G A - B - E - D -
A - B - E - G it's a path it's going
from node to node crossing edges but
it's not a simple path so simple path is
not allowed to have any repeated nodes
any shortest path is going to be a
simple path right why because if we had
any repeats along the way from A to G if
we visit B and then some time later we
go back to B then there's there's going
to be a path that just goes from A to B
and then using this path from B to G we
don't need any of these links in between
so if a shortest path actually had on it
a repeat was not a simple path then it
can't be a shortest path there must be a
shorter path still that's a
contradiction now the longest simple
path that you can have can have it most
n nodes on it because there's only n
nodes in the graph and we're not allowed
to repeat any so the longest simple
symbol path is of length M this graph
has seven nodes so let's let's ask a
question having to do with this graph
here I want you to check the boxes each
box with number K next to it if there is
a simple path of K nodes that goes from
A to G so for example it can't be 1
because it has to have at least a and G
on it and we already saw a path a B eg
that's a simple path that has four nodes
on it so we'll give you four for each
possible length check the box if there
is a simple path with that number of
nodes on it from A to G</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
