at a few more patterns and although I
will take too long to cover them in
detail I would like to at least mention
and quickly discuss a few more of these
commonly used patterns in fact some of
the patterns that I will discuss you
might have used yourself maybe without
knowing their name or the fact that they
were design patterns so let's start with
a visitor pattern which is a way of
separating an algorithm from an object
structure on which it operates and a
practical result of this separation is
the ability to add a new operation to
existing object structures without
modifying these structures so basically
what this pattern does is to allow for
defining and easily modifying a set of
operation to perform on the object of a
collection in a typical usage of this is
for example when you're visiting a graph
or a set of object and you want to
perform some operation on these objects
by using a visitor pattern you can
decouple the operation from the objects
although not straightforward this
pattern is very very useful so I really
encourage you to look at it in more
detail and get familiar with it the
second pattern I want to mention is the
decorator pattern the decorator pattern
is basically a wrapper that adds
functionality to a class so the way in
which it works is that you will take a
class you will build a class that
basically wraps this class so it
reproduces the functionality of the
original class but it also adds some
functionality and for all the
functionality that was already in the
original class it will simply invoke
this functionality and for the new one
it will implement it using the services
of the class and a nice property of the
decorator pattern is that it stackable
so you can add decorators on decorators
on decorators and further increase the
functionality provided by your class the
iterator is another very commonly used
pattern and you probably use this one
yourself because it's also part of many
standard libraries what the iterator
allows you to do is basically to access
elements of a collection without knowing
the underlying representation so the
iterator will allow you to just go
through a set of objects without
worrying about how the objects are
stored so you basically just as the
iterator to give you the first object
the next object and so on another very
commonly used pattern is the observer
pattern and this pattern is very useful
when you have an object of interest and
a set of other objects that are
interested in the changes the marker in
this first object so what the observer
pattern allows you to do is to register
these objects
so that they let the system know that
they're interested in changes in this
first object and then every time that
there is a change these other objects
will be automatically notified so
basically the observer pattern allows
for notifying dependents when an object
of interest changes if you want an
example of this just think about the
file system and imagine having a folder
all the views of this folder will want
to be notified every time that there is
a change in the folder because they need
to refresh so instead of continuously
checking the state of the folder they
will just register and basically say hey
we are interested in knowing when
something changes in this folder and
when something changes in the folder
they will be automatically notified so
it will be some sort of a push
notification instead of a pull
notification if you are familiar with
that terminology finally the proxy
pattern is a pattern in which a
surrogate controls access to an object
in other words we have our object and we
have our proxy here so all the requests
to the object will go through the proxy
they will then forward them and all the
responses from the object will also go
through the proxy they will then forward
them to the original requester so what
the proxy allows you to do is to control
how this object that is behind the proxy
is actually accessed for example by
filtering some calls so in a sense the
proxy allows use for masking some of the
functionality of the object that is
behind the proxy and there's many many
many more useful patterns that can help
you when designing and implementing the
system so once more I really encourage
you to have a look at the Booker to look
at the resources online and to really
get more familiar with these patterns
and to try to use them in your everyday
work</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
