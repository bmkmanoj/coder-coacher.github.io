example of combining the number of rooms
and the square footage into a size
feature and I asked you to just take it
on faith for a moment that the principal
component existed and it was where I
said it was now I'm going to use the
neighborhood example to show you how to
determine the principal component first
I want to start with a little bit of
vocab and the word is variance which is
a little bit confusing because you
actually already know a definition of
variance it's a very important
definition it's the willingness or
flexibility of an algorithm to learn but
we're going to mean it in a different
sense variance is also a technical term
in statistics which means roughly the
spread of a data distribution as
something that's very similar to the
standard deviation if that's something
that you're familiar with so a feature
that has a large variance has instances
that fall over a very large numerical
range of values that I can take whereas
something with a small variance means
that the features tend to be more
clustered together tightly so here's an
example using a as yet unlabeled data
set I suppose this is my data then what
I can do is draw an oval around it that
roughly contains most of the data maybe
95% of the data are within this oval now
this oval can be parameterized using two
numbers one of them is the distance
across the narrowest point the other one
is the distance across the longest point
now here's the critical question which
of these two lines points along the
direction of the maximum variance of the
data in other words in which direction
is the data more spread out check the
box that you think has the right answer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
