lets me think high level as well as
drill down into the details of each one
of the steps we showed you and the next
level of detail would be to go over the
actual UI elements within each of those
flows but unfortunately we're not going
to cover that in this course yeah and
that's where mobile constraints come in
when we think about the implementation
so let's talk about the mobile user
constraints you want to think about
handedness and decide whether or not
you're a user experience is one handed
or two handed and keep that in mind even
though we're not going to go into the UI
elements right now yeah another thing
you want to keep in mind is limited data
and battery life and sketchy network so
when you think about the menu and the
order history and all that information
that has to be downloaded for this
application to work think about syncing
that intelligently so you're not
draining battery and so that it works in
offline mode so 4 divided attention and
small screen you have to make sure that
the user interface is built in such a
way that it doesn't overwhelm the user
with too much information because again
there Debbie's out about Aden about
doing things also make intelligent use
of notifications and that's a great way
to give Debbie information when she
needs it relevant your application for
example in the order status update and
that way they don't have to open your
application and spend any more effort
than they absolutely need to to get what
they need from your app</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
