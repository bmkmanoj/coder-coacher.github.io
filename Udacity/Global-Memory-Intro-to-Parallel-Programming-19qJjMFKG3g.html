know it's a colonel because it's been
tagged with global so it's going to run
on the GPU but can be called from the
host and once again we're going to pass
in a local variable a parameter called
array and the trick is that this
parameter is pointer and so this is
actually pointing to some global memory
that we've allocated elsewhere and I'll
show you how to do that in a moment once
you've got a pointer to global memory
you can nip yyl a tit or you can
manipulate the contents of that memory
just as you would manipulate any other
chunk of memory so in this case I'm
going to take my array and I'm going to
set one of its elements which happens to
be equal to the index of this thread to
some number which happens to be 2 point
0 times the index to this thread again
not a very useful function but it
illustrates what's happening so the
point really is that since all the
parameters to a function are our local
variables are private to that thread if
you want to manipulate global memory
you're going to have to pass in a
pointer to that memory and of course
that means you're going to have to
allocate a pointer so let's look at how
that works here's the code to show off
how we use global memory the first thing
I'm going to do is declare some host
memory okay and once again I'm using the
convention that's starting a variable
with a prefix H underscore indicates
that this is memory that lives on the
host so here's an array of 128 floats
and I'm also going to declare a pointer
that I'm going to use to point to the
global memory that I allocate on the
device and once again the D underscore
vary the D underscore convention
indicates that this variable lives on
the device now I want to allocate some
global memory on the device so I'm going
to use the function CUDA malloc what's
happening here is that I'm passing it a
pointer to this variable which is itself
a pointer right and the CUDA malloc is
going to allocate some memory in this
case room for 128 floats and stuff a
pointer to that memory into the pointer
dra if you're allocating memory you'll
probably initialize it to something so
we use CUDA min copy for that operation
and in this case we pass in a pointer to
the destination memory which is this D
array that we've allocated and a pointer
to the source memory which is this H
array variable and then the number of
bytes to allocate and then we indicate
whether we're copying from
the host of device or vice versa oops
this is a bug so now we've got a chunk
of global memory we've put something in
it and now we're ready to launch the
kernel that's going to operate on that
global memory so here's the kernel that
we saw earlier again we're going to
launch a single thread block consisting
of 128 threads I'm going to pass in this
point to her I've allocated and
initialized some memory
so after this runs presumably this code
will do something to that memory that I
pass in and now I'll need to copy it
back onto the host if I want to use the
results of this kernel back on the host
then I need to copy the memory back into
host memory and so here's that operation
once again khuddam emka
this time the destination is H array the
source is D array the same number of
bytes and now we're copying from device
to host okay so that's how you use
global memory all right the trick is
that since you can only pass in local
variables to a kernel you have to
allocate an initialize global memory
outside the kernel and in pass in a
pointer finally let's look at how you
would use shared memory</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
