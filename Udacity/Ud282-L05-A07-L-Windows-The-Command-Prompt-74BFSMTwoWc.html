the Java development kit you're almost
ready to start writing Java programs on
your own computer you can write Java
code in any simple text editor which
we'll see in a bit then to run these
programs you'll need to use a command
prompt window which looks like this the
command prompt is an application that
lets you give your computer commands
it's also sometimes called a command
line terminal or shell I'm going to
close this window and show you how to
find it and open up the command prompt
to yourself the command prompt can be
found by clicking on your Start menu
going to all your applications scroll
down to your window system folder expand
this and you should see your command
prompt right here you can also just
search command or command prompt and the
applications should pop up so here's our
command prompt window inside you can see
the version of Windows that you're
running which for me is version 10 and
you can see this users directory which
varies by computer for me its users
video and then here I can start typing
commands for my first command I'm just
going to ask my computer what version of
Java it has installed this way I can
make sure that I've installed the
correct version to check this I just
type java space then dash version and
then press Enter and you should see
something like this print out it shows
me my version of Java which is a version
of Java 8 and as of the time of this
recording may 25th 2016 this is the
latest version it also tells me that I
have a Java Runtime environment and it
also says I have a Java VM which stands
for virtual machine so this looks good
and if you don't see this or see
something like a Java version not found
message then go back to the instructions
for installing the JDK and try
installing again or troubleshooting from
there we'll need to have the Java
development kit installed before we move
forward and write our own programs so
make sure you complete this step before
you continue</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
