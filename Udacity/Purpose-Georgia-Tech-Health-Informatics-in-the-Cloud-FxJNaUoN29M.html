for data physicians would use ICD
aclasta fication of diseases in their
notes the clinical laboratory would have
a classification for their tests and the
pharmacy would have a classification for
the medications they dispense as
computers came into use in hospitals the
various departments needed to share
information but we're using their own
specialized computer systems this led to
early messaging standards these
metaphysician could order a lab test or
medication at the nurse's station and
that order could be routed
electronically to the appropriate
department to do the test or send the
medication the next evolution with
standards for clinical documents a
message might typically be an order for
a lab test or medication but if what if
you want a complete summary of a
patient's care to send to the patient's
physician once they're discharged from
the hospital this is the role of
document standards more recently as
computers have become more powerful
standards have been evolving to
represent clinical workflows and
processes these have often been targeted
at hospitals but have proven to be hard
to develop and implement if this could
be overcome they could at least in
theory lead to a reduction in
unnecessary variations in the way
patients are cared for</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
