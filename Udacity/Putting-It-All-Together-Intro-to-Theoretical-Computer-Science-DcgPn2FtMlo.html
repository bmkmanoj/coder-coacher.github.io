building blocks together and we're just
this close to showing that sat is indeed
np-complete so we started out with a
problem in NP and an input for that
problem
of course this here can be any problem
in NP and this here can be any input for
that problem and what did we then do we
said if their problem is in NP and there
must be some algorithm for that problem
which runs in polynomial time on a
non-deterministic Ram so an algorithm or
a program you can call it any way you
want
so that will run in polynomial time and
the algorithm at some lines of the code
either says yes or it says no but it's
running in polynomial time in any case
and of course the input for the problem
well that is basically just a number of
variables in the memory of the machine
as it starts out and then we took all
this and of course it's a huge boolean
formula and you would probably never
really want to write it out explicitly
but it exists and it contains a number
of components that we have discussed so
one part of the boolean formula encodes
snapshots of the algorithm as it runs on
the machine then we said we have to have
one part that ensures that the first
snapshots properly represents the
starting conditions so that it probably
represents the algorithm starting at
line one and also the memory
representing the input for the problem
then what we just discussed is that
through a number of rules that look like
if then you can ensure that the
snapshots at a certain point in time T
and at the following time point fit
together and then finally since this
year is a decision problem we want to
ensure that the boolean formula can only
be satisfied if at a certain point in
time the algorithm returns yes so this
is the last part we have to add to the
boolean formula and this is actually
quite easy to ensure because once the
algorithm reaches this line of the code
wherever it may be and you can even have
multiple lines where the algorithm
returns yes but once such a line is has
been reached the algorithm returns yes
and stops so this here is very easy to
ensure you just have to make sure that
there's one snapshot where the algorithm
is in a line that returns a yes so once
we have constructed this boolean formula
what happens if we solve sat for this
formula then there's two cases that can
happen because
that is also a decision problems so
either sat returns yes or it returns no
what if it returns yes if it returns yes
that means that there is a satisfying
assignment for this boolean formula and
a satisfying assignment will have the
following property first of all it will
encode valid snapshots of where the
algorithm is and what's in the memory
secondly it will also ensure that the
machine starts out in the right place
meaning it starts out at line 1 of the
code and representing the input for the
problem it will ensure that all of the
snapshots that it has figured out will
fit together and it can only return yes
if the algorithm returns yes at some
point in time so if we have a yes here
we also know that this problem or the
decision problem here is one where a
non-deterministic Ram would also answer
yes if it says no on the other hand what
does that mean well we know that we
always can encode the snapshots so it's
not going to say no because it cannot
encode a snapshot because that's
possible always it also won't say no due
to this property here because well we
have ensured that this snapshot can be
properly encoded so there's no mistake
in the formula here so it cannot say no
because of this year it also cannot say
no because of this year because the
machine will always run and you can make
the snapshots fit together the only
reason why there can be no swear that
could be no satisfying assignment is if
the algorithm does not return yes at a
certain point in time and since this
algorithm solves this problem here if it
cannot reach yes then this means that
this decision problem here is also a no
so satisfiability only if this problem
given this input here is a yes so now
that we have put it all together here's
our final quiz for proving that Sat is
np-complete and what I would like you to
do is to recap the properties of this
boolean formula here first of all what's
the size of this boolean formula for an
input of size N and remember this
algorithm here runs in polynomial time
so is this boolean formula up here
constant and sighs polynomial in size or
exponential in size with respect to N
and then can this boolean formula encode
any algorithm at least for a problem
that is an NP can it encode any input of
size n that were given to that problem
and finally is this boolean formula only
satisfiable if the input here is a yes
to that decision problem here or are
there any other cases where we could
also have satisfiability so please check
all of these that are true</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
