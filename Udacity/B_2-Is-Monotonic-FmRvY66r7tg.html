bellman operators b1 and b2 that each
one is associated with the fixed policy
so b1 makes an update essentially
following PI 1 and B 2 makes an update
following pie too so we know a bunch of
things about these updates so for
example we know that if we apply b12 to
value functions what's going to happen
to the to the value functions as a
result they will not move further apart
by a factor of at least gamma unless
they're the same one right there already
perfectly together then they won't move
closer together because they were at a
fixed point but then there's the
distance is zero and we do get gamma
closer to zero because zero times gamma
is still zero sure so that's true but
it's but I'm just saying it's not that
they always get closer together yeah
okay all right that's that's fair okay
that's fair if they're not on top of
each other then they get closer together
and the same thing is true with be too
yeah but there's some other interesting
properties of these that that aren't
necessarily true of the standard bellman
operator but they are true when we use a
fixed policy like pie one or pie too so
let's step through what some of those
properties are and we'll use them to
show that policy iteration behaves
itself right so this is the property
that we want to show that b1 and b2 have
so if we've got to value functions v1
and v2 not only if we apply these
bellman operators to them do they get no
farther apart and actually potentially
closer together but they actually keep
their same ordering so let's say that v1
dominates v2 so v1 is bigger than or
equal to v2 at all states s then that
still is true after we've applied
bellman operator be two or belmont
operator be one but we're talking about
be too right now okay that makes sense
in it I think it follows immediately
from raising Thursday to the Monday
power oh I see no I'd that supposed to
be theorem sorry about that okay yeah we
don't do day the week math until the
next section okay looking forward to
that so how would we show something like
this is true the standard thing that we
always seem to do is go back to the
definitions and just plug the plug
things through and let's see what we get
okay to show that be to v1 dominates be
2 v 2 i'll just subtract one from the
other and see if the result is always
non-negative okay so let's do that we
plug in the definitions and I did some
canceling here because it's it always
sort of comes out this
same this sort of notion that since
we're talking about the same states and
the same actions these rewards are going
to cancel the gammas and the summations
and the and the transition probabilities
are going to factor out and we're going
to end up with something well actually a
lot like this gamma times the sum over
all states of the probability of
reaching the next state times the
difference at the new state s Prime
between the value functions v1 to v2
okay and what do we know about this
quantity here well we know that v1 is
always greater than equal to v2 which
means that v1 minus v2 has to be
non-negative good and then we take a
convex combination of a bunch of
non-negative values there's no way it
could become negative right could be
zero I guess but we know that we r
greater than or equal to 0 it can't be
smaller than zero so that's that gives
us actually exactly what we need that
that if v1 dominated v2 before b2b one
dominates be 2 v2 now nice and that if
we replaced be two would be one this
would also be true yes exactly so the
only thing that we're actually using
here is that we have a fixed policy
doesn't matter what the policy is so you
want to be two are the same operators
that they just differ as to which fixed
policy they're using ok so both be 1 NB
to have mono that's perfect no no they
don't have mono they are monotonic
meaning they preserve this kind of
ordering property not that they have
mononucleosis sometimes known as the
kissing disease well maybe where you're
