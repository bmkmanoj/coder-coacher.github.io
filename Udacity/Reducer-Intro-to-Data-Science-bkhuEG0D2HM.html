reducer for our word count problem let's
walk through this reducer line by line
and discuss what it's doing first we set
initial values for word count and old
key to zero and none respectively we
take in our data which you'll recall
will be a bunch of key value pairs
separated by a tab if we have a strange
row with more or less than a key no
value ie the length of the data array is
not equal to 2 we'll just continue on to
the next row all of these lines down
here are essentially summing up the
count for every single key we continue
through all the key value pairs for a
particular key until we notice that
we're on to a new key once this happens
we print out the key and its final word
count we then set word count equal to
zero once again you'll note that this
implementation will not emit a key value
pair for our final key because of that
we have to include this final bit of
code down here so if old key is not
equal to none let's print out one final
key value pair so say that we ran this
reducer on all of the intermediate key
value pairs our mapper in the previous
slide produced we would go through all
key value pairs with the key hello
there's only one so we omit hello 1
there are however two key value pairs
with the key my so we would omit the
final key value pair my 2 for this key
and so on so now if we use the mapper
and reducer we just wrote on a more
significant example say the text of
alice in wonderland'
we can check that it works and ensure
that it produces the same type of result
as the Python script that you wrote
earlier in this lesson we're going to
simulate running this MapReduce job by
just running these scripts locally using
Python note this isn't a real MapReduce
deployment we're only running this on
one computer if we run the script we see
that we have an output where we have all
of the words that appear in Alice in
Wonderland and the number of times that
each of those words occurs note that all
of the words are lower case and our
stripped of all punctuation</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
