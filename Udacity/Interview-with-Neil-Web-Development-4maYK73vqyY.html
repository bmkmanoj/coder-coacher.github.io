now by my friend Neal Williams who is
currently the lead engineer at reddit
maybe you can tell them a little bit
about what your job entails these days
well I basically focus first on fixing
anything if it's broken and otherwise I
try to figure out what's what's the path
for the site is like what's becoming a
bottleneck and then try and fix that and
make the site fast again how much
traffic goes right again these days last
month we got 2.7 billion page views
that's billion with the be yes and I
think when I left reddit which was in
2009 we were nowhere close to that I
don't remember specifically but I think
it's like 10x difference
I thought read it was pretty big when I
left and it was but it's a lot bigger
now and Neal and his team are basically
the guys responsible for keeping the
site fast online and functional which
over the course of Redax history hasn't
always been the case
oh we try yeah you know you guys do a
very good job it's a very impressive job
so what we're gonna do in this in this
interview here is is I'm gonna kind of
I'll start off by describing how things
work that read it before I left and then
as we said traffic increased
dramatically and Neal will show which
parts of the system are gone and what
they're doing now towards the future
because a lot of things have have really
changed you know when a site grows grows
by huge huge amounts you you have to
keep adjusting so so the way things were
when I left if I recall Neal jump in
it's been a few years and
the first piece of infrastructure we had
was the low balance we talked about load
balances in unit six the one we used was
called H a proxy and you guys still use
H a proxies yes we do yeah it's a fast
never breaks and works for us all the
time I remember the day I found a chat
box it was probably in 2007 and I I mean
even after I left for a while it's just
still the case do you have you have
multiple h8 proxies it's like we were
for a long time like we had the super
scalable architecture and one H a proxy
we have one machine running a 1 H a
proxy and that handled millions of
requests today it was pretty incredible
so of course outside of H a proxy is the
internet and all of the redditors the
unwashed masses of the world the users
of the site we also used Akamai yes you
guys still use Akamai yes we do remember
we talked about CDN content delivery
networks you know in the last unit
basically these are third-party caches
so reddit pays Akamai to ping the site
periodically cache the content and
deliver it to users who give you cash
concept we zip for logged out users only
since everybody has their own personal
page if they're logged in but logged out
users all see the same content the same
stuff so so logged out users hit Akamai
and logged in users who have custom
content you know their user name their
votes all that stuff come in the envy of
the Internet and hit HF proxy directly</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
