wrapped onto these important proteins
called histones taking on a shape that's
known as beads on a string here's an
example of a real electron microscopy
picture taken of this DNA beads on a
string structure just like you can see
in the cartoon up here wrapped around
these histone proteins is the DNA and
down here in the actual real life
picture you can see the little circular
histone proteins and they're connected
by a string in between them because the
DNA is wrapped around them and then on
to the next histone and on to the next
one and on to the next one this wrapping
and folding leads to an intermediate
form of organized DNA called the 30
nanometer fiber and it's named as you
can imagine based on its size the width
of this is actually about 30 nanometers
now that's still small obviously now the
folding doesn't stop here the 30
nanometer fiber will actually start
folding on itself here in a minute and
that's what organizes into the really
big structure that we're used to seeing
called a chromosome so another way of
looking at this is our double-stranded
DNA here and our most zoomed in picture
is actually wrapped around these histone
proteins in the 30 nanometer fiber
structure we actually call the
combination of DNA wrapped around
histones we call that chromatin and then
chromatin is organized into structures
called chromosomes chromosomes are
actually organized chromatin and you
have multiple chromosomes and the cells
in your body</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
