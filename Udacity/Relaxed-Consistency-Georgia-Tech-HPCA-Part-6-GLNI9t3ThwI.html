we allow reordering of normal accesses
according to the four types of ordering
so for example our reads can now be
reordered but only these are normal
accesses but then we add special non
reorder double accesses and the
programmer must use these non reorder
row accesses when ordering in the
program matters an example of such non
reorder roll accesses is the x86 M sink
instruction here in normal execution all
accesses are reorder abaut we cannot
rely on any specific in order behavior
as far as consistency is concerned but
no reordering can happen across an M
sink instruction so we can have any
accesses that we want reordered anywhere
in here
but in program order then comes the M
sink instruction the processor
guarantees that all of these are gonna
be done before we do M sink and that the
N Sync will be done before we begin the
next cloud of instructions that can
again be ordered with its each other so
how does that help it helps because now
we can write flag synchronization
correctly the correct weight for a flag
now includes the names in construction
it basically says that wait for the flag
to become 0 make that happen and then
use the data now the processor will
first make sure that the flag is red and
only then that the data is red because
we cannot reorder the reads to the flag
and data cross and M sync but it still
allows all sorts of performance
optimizations where very order
instructions in situations where we are
not trying to use memory for
synchronization like this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
