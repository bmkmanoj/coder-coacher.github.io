of properties and their values think
about how you would represent you or
your cell phone the email in your inbox
maybe even events such as the last party
you attended mostly a list of key value
pairs right key value pairs or
dictionaries as they're called in Python
make a lot of sense as a way to
represent data primarily because it's so
natural to represent so much of the data
we care about this way let's think about
the you example for a minute in my case
some of the features might be eyes brown
hair brown height six two wait I'll
leave that as an exercise for the viewer
note that name pairs are very different
from documents with the document we have
sections containing subsections
containing paragraphs containing
sentences this type of nesting or tree
structure is exactly the type of
structure that XML was designed to work
with in practice you'll find that XML is
used for many purposes even those for
which it's probably not the best choice
and others for which one could argue
it's not appropriate in order to ensure
you're ready to wrangle XML in all its
forms we'll give you some practice
working with applications of XML to both
documents and key value data</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
