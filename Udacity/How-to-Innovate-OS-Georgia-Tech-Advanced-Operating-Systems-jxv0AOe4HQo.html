system at Sun there is always a
conundrum of how to innovate in the
operating system academia is ripe for
pursuing ideas that are on the lunatic
fringe but if you're in industry you're
always worried about should we do a
brand new operating system or do a
better implementation of an own
operating system research and industry
is usually constrained by the
marketplace that it serves specifically
if you're a company like sun
microsystems which in its heyday is
between 1980 and their 2005 it was
making UNIX workstations and it was
building large complex service systems
which run 24 7 for a variety of
applications such as airline reservation
and so on and so forth and if you are in
that marketplace the question becomes
should we build a brand new operating
system or build a better implementation
of a known operating system marketplace
demand says that well there are legacy
applications that are running on your
current operating system and therefore
building a brand new operating system
may not be that viable in an industrial
setting so the approach they took in the
spring system at Sun Microsystems is to
be different but innovate where it makes
sense and it is a sort of like the you
may have seen commercials that says
intel inside and the idea is in
processor architecture intel is dominant
and a lot of interesting computer
architecture research happens in
innovating under the covers in the
microarchitecture so the external
interface is still well-known interface
like the Intel processor but underneath
they do a lot of innovation in the
microarchitecture in a similar manner if
you are a company like sun microsystems
that pedals UNIX boxes and you want to
retain your customer base then you want
to make sure that the external interface
remains unix and external interface
remains as unix but under the covers you
innovate where it makes sense and in
particular
you want to make sure that everything
that you do in the operating system
allows third-party vendors to develop
software against the new API is that you
may provide in the operating system and
integrate that into your operating
system while at the same time making
sure that such integration is not going
to break anything or said differently
you want to preserve all the things that
are good in standard operating system
but at the same time you want to make
sure that the innovation allows
extensibility flexibility and so on
that's sort of the approach that spring
system took and for all the things that
I just said using object orientation is
a good choice in order to make sure that
we can do innovation under the covers
while keeping the external interface the
same</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
