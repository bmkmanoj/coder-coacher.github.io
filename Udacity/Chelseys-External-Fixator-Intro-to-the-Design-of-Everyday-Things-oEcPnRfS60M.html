very curious about what this device is
that you're wearing yeah external
fixator that's what it's called that's
correct
yeah it's kind of hard to miss when I
was a kid I injured the growth plate in
my arm and as a result my humerus
stopped growing so I was missing two and
a half inches of bone and recently I had
what's called limb lengthening surgery
which involved an orthopedic surgeon REE
breaking my humerus I know it sounds
awful attaching this device and then
ever so slightly over the course of
several months I would make adjustments
to the device which would spread apart
the bone and as it healed it just filled
in that missing two and a half inches so
you have to make adjustments to this and
yeah you know what all the things we
talk about is that whenever a design has
to have external labels somebody has to
put on special labels that's the sign of
poor design and I see there are several
labels you have and what makes them even
worse is you can't even see them I can't
so making adjustments is a very
intimidating process if I do it wrong
there could be serious consequences so I
asked my doctor to help me out by adding
these labels but then when I left his
office I realized oh I can't see the
labels so yeah I sit in front of a
mirror and and look at them just to
remind me which direction and which bolt
size but you have to just take a hex
wrench and put it I do in this tiny
little hole and you can't see it I can't
yep and some of the holes are so close
together that I can put the wrench in
the wrong one so you know this is a good
example of some of the design challenges
we face in the real world on the one
hand you'd say well why isn't that
design so it's easier for the patient
and the physician on the other hand you
know if you're making a million devices
it's fairly easy to spend a lot of time
and effort to make it easy for the
people who use it but I don't know how
many of these are made not very many and
probably each one has to be specially
tailored for the patient for your
particular problem and so there probably
is no easy way to fix it i fact I've
thought about it and I don't
come up with an easy solution to make it
easy for all the people involved
external fixator strange name this would
be an interesting challenge for you
think about it if you want to learn more
about this particular device go to the
instructors notes and we show you how to
get to the websites of the company that
makes these parts</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
