simple controller on may think of a
p-type controller P stands for
proportional it's simply going to
multiply the error by some number to
produce the input for the break to be
more concrete let's multiply the error
with 100,000 meters per second squared
when doing so we can of course get huge
positive and negative numbers that do
not make any sense to control the break
so we have to clamp the output whenever
a result of that multiplication is
negative we return 0 instead whenever
the result of that multiplication is
larger than 200 meters per second
squared we return 200 meters per second
squared why could that possibly work
assume that when we are feeding this
control value of 130 meters per second
square into the break we are actually
ending up with a wheel slip of a point
1987 and the difference between the
optimum value and the actual value is 0
point 0 13 hour the controller is going
to return the same number again 130
meters per second squared so this would
constitute an equilibrium one thing to
note about this naive version of the
p-type controller is that the value of
the equilibrium is always slightly less
than the optimum if anything changes
concerning the dynamics of the car or
the road conditions this actual value
may change when the actual wheel slip
goes up a little the difference is going
to decrease we are subtracting the
actual wheel slip this is going to
become 0 point 0 0 1 29 the error gets a
little smaller now we're multiplying
this error by 100,000 meters per second
squared which results in 129 meters per
second squared we are breaking less and
as we are breaking less hopefully the
slip is going to decrease again so this
looks like a stable equilibrium it is
from the one side but obviously this
also works when the actual wheel slip is
a little too low now implement this in
Python your first job is to implement
the P control as a function the function
receives the actual value and the target
value
open to that is and returns the output
of the P control which eventually
controls the break your second job is to
call that function to control the break</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
