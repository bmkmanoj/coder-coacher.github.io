relying on our knowledge of conservation
of energy one of the big topics we
talked about in this unit and
conservation of energy says that the
kinetic energy plus the potential energy
at all points in this problem should be
the same so for this original point to
look at I'm going to choose the point
where the block is over here with an
original velocity of 2 meters per second
so it definitely has a nonzero kinetic
energy and what about the potential
energy well there's always some
gravitational potential energy but
that's not going to change in this
problem because the block is only
traveling horizontally so we can safely
ignore that for this problem so the only
potential energy were concerned about is
the potential energy of the spring and
since currently the spring is completely
uncompressed it's at its equilibrium
length we can say that the potential
energy in the spring is zero so we can
cross out this term and for my final
point I'm going to choose this point
here where the block speed is zero and
the spring is quite compressed now why
do we know this happens well the block
comes in with a velocity pointing to the
left of 2 meters per second and we know
it's going to push against the spring
and go back with a rightward velocity of
2 meters per second so somewhere along
the lines to changing between a leftward
velocity of 2 meters per second and
going to a right words velocity of 2
meters per second the velocity must have
been zero and that's actually the point
where the spring is the most compressed
during the entire course of this spring
block interaction so makes for a good
point to look at in our equation at this
point since the velocity of the block is
zero it has no kinetic energy so we know
that the final kinetic energy here is
zero all right we're making progress so
now i can replace the kinetic energy
with one-half MV squared and the
potential energy with one-half k delta x
squared like we saw in the previous
video and plug in those values and we
get that the maximum displacement away
from the equilibrium length is point one
four one meters great work</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
