the object faster and when I approached
questions like this in physics I think
of what i call limiting cases for
example I asked myself what if gravity
were zero well if there were no gravity
damage won't be attracted to the earth
at all and if you threw in some
direction it would just go floating
forever as I increase that gravity I can
see that okay yeah maybe the object will
start to get pulled towards Earth if i
make gravity huge almost infinite the
object will always be attracted to the
center of the earth so it seems like the
trend is that if gravity stronger you
have to throw a little harder if it's
weaker you don't have to throw it as
hard to maintain this circular orbit now
remember when dr. fara said that there
were two reasons why the principia
mathematica it was truly revolutionary
we can now go to the first one it
establishes one single law of
gravitation that extends right through
the whole universe before that or a
couple of hundred years before that
everybody had followed the Aristotelian
idea that there's one set of laws on
earth and a completely different set of
laws up in the heaven so that in the
heavens everything is perfection and
unchanging and eternal and on earth
everything is changing and corrupt
Galileo first but then Newton brought
all those changing ideas together and
said no there's one force that extends
right through the universe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
