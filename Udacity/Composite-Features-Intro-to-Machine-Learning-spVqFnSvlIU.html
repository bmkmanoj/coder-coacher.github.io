I have many features available to me but
I hypothesize that there's a smaller
number of features that are actually
driving the patterns in the data and
then what I do is I take that knowledge
and I try making a composite feature
that more directly probes the underlying
phenomenon these composite features are
what we'll be talking about in this
lesson
they're called principal components and
it's an extremely powerful algorithm in
this lesson we'll mostly talk about it
in the context of dimensionality
reduction how you can use principal
component analysis or PCA to bring down
the dimensionality of your features to
turn a whole bunch of features into just
a few it's also a very powerful
standalone method in its own right for
unsupervised learning and I'll give you
some of my favorite examples of that in
the latter half of this lesson it's
gonna be really cool so here's an
example of what PCA is transforming from
square footage plus a number of rooms
into a single variable that roughly
tracks the size of the house so let's
suppose this is my training data I have
the square footage on the x-axis and the
number of rooms on the y-axis now what
I'm going to do is I'm going to draw in
the principal component it will look
something like this I know this looks
like a regression at this point but it's
not and here's why with a regression
what you're trying to do is you're
trying to predict an output variable
with respect to the value of an input
variable here we're not really trying to
predict anything we're trying to come up
with a direction in the data that we can
project our data onto while losing a
minimal amount of information so here's
what that means once I found my
principal component once I have the
direction of this of this vector of this
line and just go with me for now that it
exists we'll come back to how we find it
in a little bit then what I'm going to
do is I'm going to take all of my data
points and I'm going to go through a
process that's called projection and
what a projection means it's a little
bit of a physical term almost imagine
that I had a light and light is sort of
shining down perpendicular to the
surface of this principal component then
you can imagine that all of the data
points are going to be sort of casting
shadows down onto like a piece of paper
if I put it there now my principal
component looks like this so I started
out with two-dimensional data but once
I've projected it down onto the
principal component it's in one
dimension and it's going to look
something like this now instead of being
the blue circles my data is going to be
the
lack access I've turned it into a one
dimensional distribution I've just taken
the feature that I've made in this
diagram and sort of turned it so that
it's lying flat what's it going to look
like</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
