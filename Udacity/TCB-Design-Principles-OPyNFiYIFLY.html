going to come from a number of things we
expect it to do we talked about design
principles for secure systems and this
system is something that you know
everything relies on it so it better be
secure to the degree possible so it
should be using some of those design
principles so let's go back and review a
number of those design principles that
we talk in general for secure systems
but we're going to see that they also
apply to the trusted computing base one
of the design principles was list rule
is anytime you're executing the idea is
that you execute with the fewest
possible privileges an idea is that if
you know something goes wrong so
remember trustworthy means that you know
the high likelihood that things go the
way you want them to but there's no
guarantee there's no proof as we said so
if something were to go wrong of course
we have damage containment if us things
will be affected because you know what
can be affected is what resources can be
abused is based on what privileges you
hold at the time holding as few as you
need for doing what you're doing at the
time you want to use that principle even
when you design the trusted computing
base economy is the other thing economy
is we also said keep it simple it's
really more important when it comes to
trusted code you want to keep it simple
and as small as possible the other
design principle I'm going to look at a
couple of these is open design the idea
is that Trust is not going to come
because somebody tells you take my word
for it we're not going to have trust or
confidence when security is by obscurity
we don't know how something is done but
we basically have to take someone's word
for it that's not a good way to design a
trusted computing system you do want to
have an open design so security is
because you understand exactly how that
level of security is being accomplished
or achieved we definitely want complete
mediation and that means that every
access that's one of the basic
requirements for a trusted computing
base that every access is checked any
attempt to bypass the system to go to a
resource that needs to be secured course
is going to be prevented
so we want complete mediation if that's
not there then of course you will have
no trust in in the trusted computing
base we also talked about other design
principles failsafe defaults is the
default you know is gives you safe
behavior so when it comes to access
control the default should be deny and
finally ease of use or psychological
acceptability basically we have to make
the right assumptions about what users
are able to do and what they're not able
to do if we make sort of assumptions
about users that are unreasonable
they're going to avoid security that
gets in their way
they're gonna find ways to work around
it and that's gonna result in a lower
level of trust I I decided to sort of
revisit these design principles one of
the things we're talking about here is
the trusted computing base and where
trust comes from well if it's designed
with the design principles in mind the
number of those that we have discussed
here of course that's a question you're
going to ask and if somebody answer is
in the affirmative saying yes we follow
those principles that's a good thing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
