and data has to have more than one
dimension we'll just study it for two
dimensions throughout this class so this
might be the data and we're looking for
the best line that fits the data or four
differently the parameters a and B that
we discussed before that defines the
line the word best is interesting
obviously it's impossible to put a line
for the data points over here these are
what's called nonlinear data they go up
and down data often looks like this even
with the relationship between x and y is
linear there's usually what's called
noise in the data some amount of
randomness we can't explain so in
finally the best fit we're trying to
find a line that minimizes the
difference between the data and the line
in the Y direction and that's somewhat
counterintuitive you'd normally think
the distance is given by these lines
over here in red and that is the
shortest distance irrespective of x and
y but in linear regression it turns out
that you're maximizing they were
minimizing the distance just in the Y
direction and there's a lot of theory
why this is a good idea in summary we
assume that our data is the result of us
applying some uh nonlinear function DX
plus a plus noise and if this noise is
assumed to be Gaussian then minimizing
the quadratic deviation between the data
points and the line happens to be the
correct mathematical answer but leaving
this aside what we're doing is we are
adding overall data points the
difference between our function and the
Y value of the data point with the
square and that distance is the distance
we are minimizing so let's look under
this with examples with the following
four data points which of these lines is
the smallest quadratic error it would be
the best regression line take one of the
three</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
