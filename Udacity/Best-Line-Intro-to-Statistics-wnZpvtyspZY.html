and data has to have more than one
dimension will just study it for two
dimensions are throughout this class so
this might be the data and we're looking
for the best line that fits the data or
for differently the parameters a and B
that we discussed before that defines
the line the word best is interesting
obviously it's impossible to put a line
through the data points over here these
are what's called nonlinear data they go
up and down data often looks like this
even with the relationship between X and
Y is linear there's usually what's
called noise in the data some amount of
randomness you can't explain so in
finally the best fit we're trying to
find a line that minimizes the
difference between the data and the line
in the Y direction and that's somewhat
counterintuitive you'd normally think
the distance is given by these lines
over here and read and that is the
shortest distance irrespective of x and
y but in linear regression it turns out
that you're maximizing they were
minimizing the distance just in the Y
direction and there's a lot of theory
why this is a good idea in summary we
assume that our data is the result of us
applying some unknown linear function DX
plus a plus noise and if this noise is
assumed to be Gaussian then minimizing
the quadratic deviation between the data
points and the line happens to be the
correct mathematical answer but leaving
this aside what we're doing is we are
adding overall data points the
difference between our function and the
y value of the data point with the
square and their distance is the
distance we are minimizing so let's look
into this with examples with the
following four data points which of
these lines has the smallest quadratic
error it would be the best regression
line pick one of the three</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
