there are some good things about it
right it's pure probability right very
very clean probabilistic thing in fact
it's been known for a very long time
which should give you a hint that it's
not going to be the most powerful method
used because it comes from a time when
computers were non-existent or scarce
and we have to use a lot of mathematical
reasoning pure mathematics in order to
do the work but it is on got it says
you're a firm probabilistic rounding it
allows you to use your priors so if you
have priors maybe your context gives you
a prior I know how that I'm in a bedroom
so the probability of seeing a lamp is a
lot higher than if I'm in a garage ok
that kind of thing so I can have a prior
built into it one that's in yellow here
actually there's two of them that are
yellow because I think they're actually
are important one is that because you're
doing this parametric modeling of
continuous functions you can actually
get away with using a pretty small
amount of data compared to other methods
we're gonna look at later the
discriminative methods so that's one and
the second good thing about it is your
models are about each category and just
about the category so when you tell me
about some new category I just have to
learn a model for that category I don't
have to play with this model whereas if
I'm trying to learn how to distinguish
between an A and a B and an A and a C
now you tell me about DS I have to worry
about aids versus DS as well so when you
add in new categories and you're trying
to scrim innate you often have to worry
about a lot of different categories in
the generative model I just build a
model for that new category there are
some other advantages of generative
models that we haven't talked about you
can use unlabeled data in interesting
ways
you can also use it to generate data
right so if I say something is
distributive or Gaussian I can actually
make more examples and there are times
and when that's useful so that would be
all the good news what always follows
the good news is the not-so-good news
so where did you get those priors ok so
again you go to Greece you go to the
Sears Pryor store the sensitivity that
priors really matters and the priors can
be affected by things like context
there's this other thing that's also
kind of annoying a modeling skin and
I've got not skin
well skin you might say is a plausible
model not skin
modeling not skin is kind of a weird
thing right what I really want to do is
model sort of the the boundary between
all the stuff that's skin and everything
else that's out there and by the way a
lot of stuff that's out there doesn't
look anything like skin at all so that
stuff is easy what I really need to
worry about are the things that are kind
of like skin but aren't in fact that's
the next example it says the example
hard cases aren't special and they
should be right so I'm trying to
recognize you know rattlesnakes in the
brush I don't have to worry about what
Maseratis look like I do have to worry
about the difference between what
rattlesnakes look like and maybe
different kinds of grass because there's
a tight similarity between them so this
idea that modeling the hard cases is
really what's important in fact I think
that's what's most important about
discriminative learning and then the
last thing is if you have lots and lots
and lots and lots and lots of data it
doesn't really help if I'm modeling my
world is a sort of a single distribution
once I have enough data doesn't you know
I can fit some nice mixture of gaussians
I'm done it's not helping me in
comparing against other elements so it's
not really leveraging having large data
so those are the downsides of generative
models</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
