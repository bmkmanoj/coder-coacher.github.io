learned about cognitive load theory and
through that lens of cognitive load
analyze the strengths and weakness of a
Udacity lesson well a portion of Udacity
lesson and this lesson is going to come
from the class that taught me how to
code intro to computer science the next
three videos are going to be videos
which are copy and pasted from this
course and to set a little context for
you're going to be watching this is the
very beginning of the second lesson in
the course the goal for this course is
to create a search engine and in doing
so learn how to program it's an
excellent course one of the best Udacity
has ever made in my opinion but this
segment of this lesson has some serious
weaknesses now go through the next three
videos and as you do keep notes about
what you see as sources of cognitive
load with a focus on extraneous and
therefore avoidable cognitive load</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
