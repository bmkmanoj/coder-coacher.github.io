we see that the condition and here not
only handled double quotes but also
single quotes question is is there a
difference in how the condition handles
double quotes and single quotes we still
have this hypothesis characterizing the
error let's see whether generalizes to
arbitrary quotes that is general quotes
are stripped from the input whether they
be double or single in order to check
the hypothesis we now use an input foo
and single quotes and we'd expect the
output to have single quotes as well in
the output what's happening in here here
again we have a program we now need to
remove these assertions in order to
restore it to its original state and now
we're going to invoke this with foo and
single quotes and again we need to
enclose this with quotes to make this a
Python string general rule of thumb if
you have single quotes in a Python
strain you need to enclose it in double
quotes if you have double quotes in a
Python string you need to enclose it in
single quotes and if you have both you
need to come up with an addition of
multiple strings enclosed in single
quotes and double quotes so here we go
we put in foo and single quotes into the
program and now let's see what happens
surprise what you see here if he put in
single quotes they are not stripped
whereas just to recheck double quotes
however are stripped from the input
that's the important and double quotes
are stripped single quotes are not so
the output actually contains single
quote which means that our hypothesis is
up here is rejected because single codes
are not stripped</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
