this functionality in a method gave me a
minute to arrange that and then I'll
show you as promised here is my method
this method keeps reading an integer
until it finds one that is within the
desired range and then it returns it the
exact code isn't really important right
now
you can have a look at it in the code
distribution if you want to and now here
I'm calling it but there's a problem
when I compile it I get an error message
and that error message right now must
truly appear like gibberish to you where
talks about non-static methods and
static methods so let me explain what's
happening here and why the compiler is
unhappy normally we call a method on an
object and I didn't do that here because
I figured well I'm in elevator demo so I
should be able to call any elevator demo
method as well but the trouble is I'm
calling from main so there are no
elevator demo objects and the compiler
complains so going back here that is the
crux of the problem read between is not
call and an object and there really
isn't a great object to call it on it
would have been nice to call it on the
scanner
but like I already said we can't do that
whenever you're in this kind of
situation where you have a method that
can't really be called in an object then
you make a static method a static method
is a method that's not called in any
object so one remedy is simply to go
back into elevator demo and declare the
helper method static like this now all
will be well and the syntax error is
gone so to answer our original question
it's perfectly legitimate to put read
between inter elevator demo as a static
method but maybe it's not optimal
because what if I wants to use that
perfectly nifty method in another class
so really read between is a method that
seems it would be
useful in any situation that you want to
read a value from some range so we might
really want to put this somewhere else
and the class that I'm gonna put it on
I'll call I oh helper I've prepared that
class for you let me show you here is
the i/o helper class here is the read
between method and again it's a static
method because I'm not going to actually
make any objects off the i/o helper
class I just want it to be the home for
this method that means when I call the
method I have to specify the name of the
class like this here you see the name of
the class io helper the name of the
method static methods are not incredibly
common because like I said most of the
time an actual object is responsible for
carrying out a method but they do happen
in fact you've seen a few of them in
Lesson four you saw a good number of
static methods in the math class again
the syntax is the name of the class a
period and then the name of the method
and once again there is no object off
the math class we simply call the square
root method directly on the class now
you may wonder why did we have to use a
static method why couldn't we just call
the method on the number two well that's
what it's like in java and java numbers
are not objects so you can never call a
method on an object a calls such as two
dot square root might be more logical
but it's an error so to summarize the
static method belongs to a class it's
not called an an object and they're not
actually all that common why do you call
them static methods there's no good
reason actually that's a holdover from
another much more ancient programming
language there's nothing particularly
static about them in addition to static
methods there are static variables let's
have a look at them next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
