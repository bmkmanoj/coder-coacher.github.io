about what the rules are and what it
means to play a word with in a row and
how that hooks up to the other columns
now the rules say that at least one
letter that you play has to be adjacent
to an existing letter on the board so
we'll mark with red asterisks such
squares and we call these anchor squares
these are the squares that we can start
from and then we build out in each
direction forming consecutive letters
into a single word now the anchor
squares do have to be adjacent to an
existing letter but they don't have to
be adjacent all within a row they can be
adjacent in either direction so let's
expand the board beyond the single row
and let's populate this with some more
letters and imagine that this bordeaux's
on in both directions you know there's
probably an e here or something like
that but if we restrict our attention
just to this row notice that we now
introduced a new anchor point this
square is adjacent to an existing letter
and so that also counts as an anchor now
we want to find a word which consists of
a prefix + a suffix we get to define the
game so we can say that for every anchor
point the prefix is going to be 0 or
more letters to the left of the anchor
point not counting the anchor point
itself and then the suffix will be the
anchor point and everything to the right
and of course we have to arrange so that
prefix + stuff pics together form a word
which is in the dictionary now here's a
cool play that comes from the dictionary
backbench is a word and note that if we
just have this rule of word equals
prefix + suffix where the suffix has to
start with an anchor then there before
possible ways of specifying this one
move we could anchor it here with no
suffix we could anchor it here with
these three letters of the suffix we can
anchor it here with these letters of the
suffix or we can anchor it here with all
these as a suffix and just H as the
prefix now it seems wasteful to generate
the same result four times so we can
arbitrarily and without loss of
completeness make up a rule which says
there's no anchor within a prefix we
couldn't use this as the anchor because
then there'd be anchors within the
prefix and like
we couldn't use this one or this one so
we can only use this one as the prefix
in order to generate this particular
word the anchor will also come from the
hand and the suffix can be a mix of hand
and bored so here this is the anchor the
prefix is empty the anchor letter comes
from the hand and then there's a mix of
letters for the rest of the word now
what are the rules for a prefix let's
summarize prefixes 0 more characters
can't cover up an anchor square and they
can only cover empty squares so for
example for this anchor square here the
prefix can go backwards but it can't
cover this anchor and so the possible
lengths for this prefix are zero to two
characters any prefix can be zero
characters and here there's room for two
but there's not room for three because
then it would cover up an anchor and in
that case all the letters in the prefix
come from the hand but consider this
anchor for this anchor we're required to
take these two letters as part of the
prefix because we can't go without them
because this abuts so these two must be
part of the prefix and this one can't be
part of the prefix because it's an
anchor and so if we wanted that we
generated from this anchor rather than
from this one so that means the length
of a prefix for this anchor has to be
exactly 2 and similarly the length for
the prefix for this anchor has to be
exactly one has to conclude this
character because if we place a letter
here this is adjacent it's got to be
part of the word and this is an anchor
so we can't cover it and so we see that
a prefix either the letters come all
from the hand or they come all from the
board and what I want you to do is for
the remaining anchors here tell me what
the possible lengths are so either put a
single number like this or a range of
numbers number dash number</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
