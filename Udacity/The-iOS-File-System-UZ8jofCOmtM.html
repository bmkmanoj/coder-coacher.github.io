the system by which the permanent
storage space of a device is organized
and divided up to hold files the type of
file system a machine has is determined
by the operating system running on that
machine for iPhones and iPads this
operating system is called iOS and
similar to the operating system running
on Macs it dictates a UNIX based file
system made up of a hierarchy of
directories with the primary goals of
security and simplicity in mind the file
system for iOS was conceived with the
notion of treating all apps as
self-contained independent islands each
app when its installed is placed in
what's called a sandbox or
self-contained area of the filesystem in
which to keep all of its stuff you can
imagine a new app on your device as a
new student at a school let's call her
Abigail the new student is given a
locker to keep books papers personal
items and whatever else the locker is
locked so only this student has access
to her own things likewise the student
doesn't have access to any fellow
students lockers the only thing is
imagine that this is a magical school
and that the lockers maintain magical
properties there is an overall finite
amount of space that all the lockers
combined can take up but until that
space limit is reached each student's
Locker will expand to fit whatever is
put into it or new lockers can be
created whereas if a student has to
store a gym bag in large textbooks as
long as the overall locker system has
extra space this students personal
Locker will expand to fit as items
likewise you the device's owner get to
decide how you want the space allocated
whether you want to keep 12 gigabytes of
photos and 6 gigs of music and 6 gigs of
small apps the choice is up to you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
