authentication can be implemented it
could be something that the user knows
so this has to be a secret a secret that
is shared between the user and the
system and the fact that you're able to
produce that secret that's associated
with the user that means you are that
person that is the evidence that you are
who you claim to be a password for
example is a secret isn't it we say ask
people to pick a password that others
cannot guess or easily guess well that's
your secret so one way to do
authentication is that users have a
secret that they can produce to the
system and the system is able to check
that the secret really is the one that
is associated with that user the other
possibility is something the user has so
think of this as some sort of a token or
a smart card or something that you use
and the fact that you have it means you
have possession of it
so possession of that token we have to
talk about how this could be used for
authentication the fact that it's with
you Mart card or token is with you a fob
for example people use that that's with
you
that means it must be the user who
you're claiming to be or the user who's
should be possessing this particular
thing the first thing is something you
know the second is something you have on
you or with you the third thing we can
think of is something the user is or
something you are so this could be for
example your fingerprint this could be
your voice for example people talk about
voice biometric or their smartphone
devices that you can talk to for example
so this would be some biometric
something that is unique hopefully to
the user because we don't want somebody
else to become you
so this biometric has to be something
that's specific to you and if you're
able to produce that the system you're
able to give that to the system and able
system is able to check that actually it
is your fingerprint then the
authentication is based on something the
user is something you know something you
have or something you are
these are sort of the three basic
methods that are used in almost all the
authentication techniques that we use in
computer systems so we going to again
look a little bit more deeply into how
authentication is implemented using one
of these methods that we talked about
secret you share with the system or
something you have or something you are
so the the basic sort of sequence of
steps that we're going to have is that
the user is actually going to come to
the system and is going to request
access to it and we know that is going
to start with request for authentication
you first have to authenticate yourself
the system the operating system here is
going to take whatever claim about
identity you make so for example you may
be saying this is my login name so it's
gonna read those keystrokes and that's
who you are and if you're providing for
example a password then the the
operating system at this point is going
to run this login program and the login
program is going to check that the
information that you provide for example
the password you provide is really your
password is the password we have
associated with this user if there's a
match with what the system knows and
what you provide that is a true positive
if it's the right user then that's a
true positive the outcome is positive
here so the user is authenticated and
when the user is authenticated a user
shell this is how you can now initiate
you know any further actions that you
want to perform so this is sort of the
case where the right user provides the
right kind of evidence the login program
is able to check and successfully login
the user well the check could fail and
if it fails then the system believes
that the user has not provided the
correct information and if the user has
not provided the correct information
it's probably not the user who's being
claimed that identity that is being
claimed probably doesn't belong to the
user who's asking for authentication so
this could be impersonation for example
so in
this case the system doesn't have the
right evidence them doesn't have this
match so it's not going to authenticate
the user so in this case authentication
fails maybe you retype your password if
you're not the right user then that's a
good thing so then that if you are not
the right user you even you're trying to
be you're trying to log in as Alice and
the system sighs no that's good that
that is a true negative actually the
outcome is negative and it's the right
thing okay so Eve tries to log in as
Alice and we end up here that's it true
negative when Alice tries to log in as
Alice we come here that is a true
positive so this is how the
authentication process is implemented a
couple of things to know here is that we
have to read the evidence or capture the
evidence we have to compare it and then
decide whether there's a match or not
and go either this path or the other
path</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
