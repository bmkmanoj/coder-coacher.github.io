the question given an image like this
how would we transform it to image like
this again here I'm basically showing a
little bit of scaling in one direction
only let's start off by basically
finding two points on my original image
f this is my original image F and I'm
trying to get my output mhg here I
basically have two points that I've kind
of marked of course what we now
interested in is seeing where these two
points would be on this image where
would they transform to so call this one
p1 and we'll call this image or point
here p to this p1 and p2 have now moved
to different points here so of course
this is now all these two points and
just for sake of clarity we will call
this p2 prime and then we will call this
p1 prime so in essence now what we have
to figure out is how to transform the
point P to P Prime so in essence what we
need now is the simple function that
takes any point p of course in this
scale you think in this case they would
have values of X&amp;amp;Y to generate a new
point P Prime in this case we wanted to
find one function T which has a set of
parameters that actually applies this
thing entirely to the whole image so in
this case I'm basically talking about
one function that directly applies to
each and every pixel this basically
means that this would be a global war
air with the same function the same
parametric function would be applied to
the entire image so in essence would be
talking about is a global function that
given a P we would always get a P Prime
and just to reiterate but basically I'm
talking about is I want to come up with
a few set of simple parameters so by now
you notice that I like to convert
everything to matrices because that's a
great representation for us to be
playing around with and of course this
is true here when we really want to do
is find a matrix that encodes all of the
transformation or the parameters and
then when applied at Point P and again
remember this would be just simple x and
y to generate a new x and y basically
this is the simple two-dimensional
transformation we're looking at given a
matrix m that has certain sets of
parameters when applied to point x and y
anywhere in this f function which is my
first one i would get an output g which
would have
all X prime and y prime so by just
looking at this you may note that this M
should be 2 a 2 by 2 matrix and now
let's start to figure out what would be
in this two-by-two matrix</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
