redundancy based approach which is the
end module redundancy for n equals two
we have already seen a brief example of
that we call this dual module redundancy
and we have seen that it can guarantee
detection but not also correction of one
fold or one faulty module for that
matter note that we can detect sometimes
more than one fault as long as these
faults are in the same module or as long
as they're affecting different results
of the modules but all we can guarantee
really is that a single fault will be
detected and we cannot guarantee its
correction because really this technique
doesn't correct anything N equals 3
gives us what's called triple modular
redundancy and it allows us to correct
any one fault
or even all faults produced by a single
faulty module again sometimes we can
tolerate more than one faulty module if
the two faults into different modules
don't affect the same result but all we
can really guarantee as far as the
number of faults we can correct is that
all faults that occur within the same
module will be corrected and that's
because the other two modules are
functioning correctly and their correct
outputs are going to output whatever the
faulty one is producing we also have
examples when n is equal five and that
will be called 5 module redundancy a
good example for that is the space
shuttle it has five computers that are
doing the same thing and then they vote
if we get one wrong result in a vote we
just continue normal operation of the
space shuttle if we get two wrong
results in a vote the mission would be
aborted but there is still no failure
because the 3 correct wrong results are
still out voting the two bad ones we are
aborting our mission because if another
module fails and now we have three wrong
results in our vote we can no longer
correct that and we can get the by by
space shuttle scenario so the idea is if
we got one vote wrong we know we can
tolerate more than that without any
problems so we will just continue normal
operation these missions are expensive
so really
if there is a single failure you know we
want to be able to continue normally
another one happening after the first
computer has had them problem is a very
rare occurrence and we would abort the
mission
because now we have some time to safely
land the space shuttle while we still
have three function in modules if it
ever gets to another one failing after
that we can no longer promise that
things will be correct and at that point
we are risking the astronauts lives and
possibly some people on earth too so
that's why the mission gets aborted
before this happens</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
