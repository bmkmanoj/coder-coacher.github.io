be tricky as new versions of components
are released backward compatibility
becomes a problem if you are a component
vendor you need to keep your customers
up-to-date with changing standards new
programming language releases and
enhanced features the question then
becomes to what extent should you remain
compatible with previous versions think
of the issue from the customers point of
view they have a working product it will
cost them time and energy to upgrade to
a new version of your component and
there's a risk of breaking their system
if they do so if they don't need the new
feature that you are offering they're
going to be reluctant to upgrade from
your point of view however this may mean
that you have to maintain and support a
long history of previous versions at
additional expense moreover if there are
multiple components involved each with
their own versions you have an explosion
in the number of combinations you have
to support whatsapp or vendor to do</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
