reflection model such as maintaining
energy conservation this means that
there's not more energy reflected from
the surface than shines on it for
example the diffuse term should drop off
when the specular term is stronger this
sort of reflection model is called
physically based since it has some
relationship to how light truly works
with in film production and game
creation there's a trend towards
physically based systems one advantage
is that materials are more
understandable by artists for example
with our energy balance blin fog
material we can adjust the shininess
without worrying as much that will also
have to adjust the overall intensity one
element in a physically-based system is
getting the materials right but that's
just a start for example the time of day
might change from daytime to Twilight so
that the overall illumination in the
scene is considerably less instead of
making everything dark some rendering
systems try to adapt this is similar to
what a photographer does by adjusting
the exposure one way is to compute a
high-precision image and automatically
change the brightness and contrast to
make the displayed image look good this
sort of analysis and display is called
tone mapping and is fairly commonly used
in games and other applications now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
