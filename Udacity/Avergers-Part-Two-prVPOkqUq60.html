average errs so what we need is there's
a set of states and we're going to need
to define the value at those states and
there's a second set of states the the
what I was calling the anchor points
here are the basis set of basis to
define the value of some state s we need
to know what the convex combination of
the basis values we're going to take so
we need to have specified you know what
the basis set is it's going to be part
of our function approximate is going to
get to pick the value at those basis
points and we have to predefine the
averaging wait the convex combination
wait between any given state that we
want to do an approximation and any
given basis point any anchor point that
we want to adopt some of its value for
so these are the parameters that the
function approximator gets to alter
these are all predefined things that
define how the value of other states are
going to be defined in terms of these
parameters so it looks a lot like the
linear case right except it's not well
and in particular you're missing
something I mean I was going to say it
looks just like the linear case but
there's nothing in there their forces it
to be a convex combination are you
written it oh right so that goes without
saying but I should probably say it
these particular weights that were
defining need to need to make it so that
the value of any state is a convex
combination of these parameters so I
wrote that in math too so for all states
and basis points or anchor points the
the weight between them is non-negative
and they sum up to 1 okay this lets us
express things like these kind of linear
interpolation that we mentioned before
and in fact even these kinds of smooth
or maybe even colonel eyes
representations work as well as long as
at any point where you need to make a
prediction there is a set of these
weights W that define how we're going to
define the value at that point in terms
of the value of the set of anchor points
sounds good to me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
