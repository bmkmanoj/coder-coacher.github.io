the Gaussian elimination algorithm
ourselves to start us off I've written a
template for a Python module that
represents a system of linear equations
I'll give a brief overview of it here it
is also available for download in the
downloadable section in this segment and
the rest of the lesson we can initialize
a new linear system object by providing
a list of playing objects the
initializer makes sure all of our planes
live in the same dimension so we can't
mix planes living in three dimensional
space with objects such as lines living
in two-dimensional space there are
currently three empty functions swap
rows multiply coefficient and row and
add multiple times row to row these will
be the focus of the first stage of
building the Gaussian elimination
algorithm there's also a function which
obtains which term of each equation is
the first nonzero term this will be
useful for finding the pivot variables
in each equation note that the terms are
zero index instead of one indexed though
we shouldn't need to worry about that
since we won't be directly manipulating
the indices of the lists that make up
the system we also have some utility
functions available to us the el en
function returns how many planes are in
the system in other words how many
equations are in the system we can also
use subscript notation to access a
particular plane or equation in the
system as demonstrated in the example
code at the bottom of the module there's
also an STR method that lets us print a
pretty version of the system of
equations finally in the module I've
included a simple extension of the
decimal class it gives us the ability to
quickly check whether a decimal object
is within a given tolerance to zero in
this case the default tolerance is 10 to
the minus 10 if you execute the test
code given at the bottom of the module
you can see the output of these
functions on an example system feel free
to take some time to play around with
this example for instance by changing
the coefficients to get a feel for the
functionality of the linear system class</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
