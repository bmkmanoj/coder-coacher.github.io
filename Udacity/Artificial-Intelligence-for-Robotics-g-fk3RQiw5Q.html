the coolest thing ever built they're
going to change society make driving
safer and we transform our cities this
course you can now learn all the basics
what it takes to program a self-driving
car in fact you program with yourself so
right now in Google self-driving car the
car that party might have been building
up over the last couple of years I'm
going to hit the button auto driving and
the car is driving itself the steering
wheel moves by itself the gas the brake
it's sheer magic in seven weeks in this
class you will learn how to do this you
will be program the basic algorithms and
data structures necessary to build
self-driving cars but this isn't just a
self-driving car course it's really a
basic artificial intelligence class and
there were perception control planning
all the ingredients that make robots
really smart these days prerequisites
well I hope you able to program in
Python and some good knowledge of linear
algebra and probability will be
extremely helpful I see you in class</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
