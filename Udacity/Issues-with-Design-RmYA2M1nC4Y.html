design methods you as a architect or
designer have to make some choice are
you going to go do things top-down
bottom-up inside-out there are a variety
of choices there are you going to begin
by thinking of the procedures and
functions or are you going to begin by
thinking in terms of the nouns and
objects like you would with
object-oriented development a topic
which we'll come back to later in the
lesson is the issue of conceptual
integrity versus cooperative development
an important decision in many software
development shops is the trade-off or
the tension between doing a design that
takes a little bit more time in order to
save yourself effort and money in the
long term by supporting maintainable and
general structures or are you going to
be dominated by the short term delivery
schedule and finally is the role of
tools what what tools are you going to
use in support of your particular design</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
