generally undecidable for seven pairs of
strings or more and to see that well you
only need seven pairs of strings to
specify any computer program and that
includes undecidable computer programs
so if PCB was decidable for seven pairs
of strings or more then you would be
able to answer undecidable questions the
second statement is not true PCP is not
generally decidable for six pairs of
strings or less and that's because we
don't know if we can represent an
undecidable computer program with less
than seven pairs of strings we might
well be able to so we can't say this for
certain this third statement is true any
SAT problem can be transformed into a
PCP using seven strings we might be able
to transform it into a PCP using less
than seven strings but if we can do that
we can certainly use seven strings and
just not actually use them in our list
of decisions and by that same reasoning
this last statement is not true no PCP
instance with seven pairs of strings or
more is decidable that's actually not
the case because you can think of a
decidable program with less than seven
strings or seven pairs of strings and
then simply add in more strings that you
don't end up using and this is perfectly
acceptable so this is not a true
statement</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
