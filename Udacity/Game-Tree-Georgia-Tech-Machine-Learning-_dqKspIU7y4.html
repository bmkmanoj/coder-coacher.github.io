again two players a and B and a gets to
make a choice first to go left or right
and B will find herself in a situation
perhaps where she gets to choose to go
left to right as well I've drawn these
little square boxes though to represent
chance so what this means is that if a
goes left you end up in a chance box
where you flip a coin and 50% of the
time you end up over here and 50% of the
time you end up over here along a
similar vein if a goes right and then B
goes left then you end up at another
chance node and 80% of the time you end
up here and 20% of the time you end up
here
alternately B goes right you always end
up here does that make sense I think so
huh so what we've done is we've gone
from a two player zero-sum deterministic
game of perfect information to a two
player zero-sum non-deterministic game
of perfect information
okay so we've relaxed we've gone at
least one level up in complexity okay so
do you understand this tree do you
understand this set up yeah I think so I
mean here the stochastic miss is
happening essentially at the leaves what
does that mean that there's no choices
to make for either player after this
randomness happens but is that that's
not what you mean in general right no
that's right there could be after here
you end up in a different state where
you can then make more choices but
because I don't have enough room and
because I want to make it simple it just
sort of ends after that okay but yes
this tree could keep going on and there
could be short random choices chance
nodes happening everywhere there could
have been a chance no that happened at
the very beginning even I feel like I
could work out the value of this game oh
well how would you go about working out
the value of the game I would probably
have it as a quiz okay but what would
the quiz look like it would say what's
the value of this game okay do you think
that just having that be the quiz is the
best way for someone to learn do you
think maybe it can be done in stages oh
I don't know do you have other questions
that you want to ask well you know how
would you go about determining the value
of the game I think the first thing you
would do at least if you were patterning
after what we just did is you would try
to write down a matrix sure so I'm going
to write down a matrix so that our
students will get a chance to to
work out what that major looks like and
then from there figure out the value of
the games is it are you okay with that
sure
okay so if we were going to do that of
course the first thing we'd have to do
is I'd have to figure out figure out
what the strategies are so what are a
strategy I would have called them left
and right but if they're not labeled
yeah well let's do that let's call them
left and right
they can go left or it can go right what
about B strategies B can go left or
right and B can go left or right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
