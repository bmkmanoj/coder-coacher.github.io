wavy stuff that I did which I like a bit
more concrete which you should
appreciate because I'm making an
abstraction more concrete thank you
thank you very much I'm here all week in
order in order to do that we're going to
actually introduce a real formulism
called options and options are just a
way of writing down explicitly what we
mean by this temporal abstraction you
know new actions idea okay and is this
related to concepts like the financial
version of options like stock options
I'm gonna say no because I don't I've
never really understood those things oh
so maybe they are related probably not
though I'm gonna say that options are
just a fancy way of saying choices it's
a fancy way of saying actions here's
what an option actually is so an option
is a tuple because everything in life is
a tuple and it has three parts to it so
in fact it's a triple it has I which is
the initiation set it has PI which is
almost always the case of policy and
then it has beta which is a termination
set so let me just let me explain what I
mean by those things so the initiation
set I is just the set of states where
the particular option or super action
like go-to doorway in the south is
actually legal to be executed so this is
where it may start or initiate so
there's a set of states where an action
actually makes sense so let's take your
your action which was a go to the the
door to the south right so that's
clearly legal inside the northeast
corner but I think the way you meant it
anyway it's not really something that
you would execute from say the southwest
corner this seemed reasonable yeah I
feel like I feel like it sort of
violates the spirit a little bit if it's
the case that you can navigate to that
South doorway from anywhere then why not
just navigate to the goal from anywhere
right it's a we're not really breaking
it down into simpler subproblems right
exactly so in fact we should just have
one action which is solve the problem
right and you should just execute that
that's going to be at least as hard to
learn as the original problem and
probably is hard to execute if you
already had that then there was nothing
to do in the first place is the
aesthetic here sort of like I don't know
algorithm design in computer science a
sort of a
you want to break a problem up into
subproblems but somehow have solved a
little bit of the main problem along the
way I'm thinking things like I don't
know quicksort and mergesort and so
forth where you you you recursively
solved the same kind of problem but it's
not cyclical it's not like you make no
progress because at each time you break
down the problem it actually makes it a
little bit easier right so in fact I
think the word abstraction here is is
quite important we do abstraction when
we code right we create functions and
then we use those functions to think
about the problem at a more abstract
level and it allows us to solve the
problem or easily and so it's yeah so I
think that's a pretty good analogy it's
not a perfect analogy there's not really
an input and an output here but it's
trying to solve the same idea of
modularity and reusability for that
matter and it allows us to make the
problem easier to think about and easier
to solve cool I like how computer
science comes up even inside of computer
science as computing is everywhere it is
computing all the way down</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
