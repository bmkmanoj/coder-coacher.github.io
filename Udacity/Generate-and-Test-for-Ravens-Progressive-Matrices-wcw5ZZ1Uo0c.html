intelligence test to see how generating
test might apply is a problem-solving
method again here is a problem that we
have encountered earlier notice that
this is a more complicated problem than
the guards and prisoners problem here is
why in case of the guards and prisoners
problem each transformation from one
state to another was a discrete
transformation one could take a certain
number of guards with it aside one could
take a certain number of prisoners to
the other side or one could take a
certain number of guards and prisoners
to the other side in this case if I look
at the transformation between a and B
then I notice that the diamond inside
the circle is now outside the circle and
is larger now suppose I would have tried
the same transformation from C to D so I
can look at the circle inside the
triangle put it outside and also make it
larger I notice that when I put it
outside I can put it outside right next
to the triangle a little bit further I
were a little bit further I were a
little bit further away I could make it
the same size a little larger a lot
larger increase its size with fifty
percent of fifty one percent of fifty
two percent so the space of
possibilities here is very large so for
problems of this kind the need for a
smarter generator and a smarter tester
is critical because this space of
possibilities can become very large very
quickly</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
