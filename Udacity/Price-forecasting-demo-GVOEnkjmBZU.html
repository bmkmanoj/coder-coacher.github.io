very same algorithms in a real
application this is a cloud-based
application called quant desk it was
developed by a company I co-founded
called the center research now the way
it works is over on the left here there
are various lists of stocks that you can
choose from I've chosen dow jones and
when you click on that you can see the
list of stocks that make up that group
of stocks there are any number of ways
that you can list particular stocks
you're interested in looking at now over
here are our forecasting options and
this is how we tell the machine learning
algorithm which factors we want to use
how far in the future do we want to
predict and so on we're using right now
the default model and what that is is
that's the list of factors that we think
are important for making a future price
prediction so we can click here and see
what those factors are this is the list
of factors that we're using now so it
turns out that these factors are
determined using another machine
learning algorithm we use a genetic
algorithm for discovering these that's a
subject for a different lecture but
anyhow these are the list of factors
considered at present now let's do a one
week forecast let's make it a one month
forecast and let's use three months of
data so we're gonna be looking back
three months at all these factors we're
gonna be when we roll back time we're
able to see the future price of these
stocks so we can see how those factors
presumably affected the future price so
let's do a forecast and see what the
result looks like so this area here is
the forecast for Apple this is the
historical price looking back in the
last three months and this is the
forecast future price so that line is
indicating that we think it's going to
go up and these this arced line above
and below is our confidence interval we
also report that data in a tabular
format up here so this is the current
price this is the forecast change in
price
and the forecast percentage change so
our system thinks that from today Apple
is going to go up about 2.5 percent now
we also report some other information
over here we report what we call
confidence and back test score
confidence refers to when we find those
K nearest neighbors how diverse are the
Y's that comes back so K is the number
of neighbors and when we look at all
those neighbors that are the closest to
the values of the quantities that Apple
has today we find the 30 closest ones
and we look at the standard deviation
among all those 30 if they're very close
we're confident in our prediction if
they're spread apart we're less
confident so you can see here American
Express has a more confident prediction
and we rate this by a number of stars by
the way we're 5 stars represent our most
confident estimates and one star of
course our least our least confident so
our system thinks that American Express
is going to go down by 0.9 percent over
the next month it's got a high
confidence and it's also got a high back
test score so what's this back test
score what we do is we roll back time
and we look over all this last three
months and look forward one month and we
see how accurate all those predictions
were over the last three months the more
accurate those were the higher ranking
we get there so this is just an example
of how we can use these same tools to
make predictions in a live real system
and this is using behind the scenes the
same software that you're learning in
