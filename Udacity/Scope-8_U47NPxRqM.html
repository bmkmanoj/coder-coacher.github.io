controllers and applying them to
templates using angular specific
attributes called directives but how
does angular actually make the
connection between the data and the
template when data changes in the
website how does they update in the
controller it all depends on angular
scope angular scope is an object that
refers to an applications data it's the
bridge between the template and the
controller and is the vehicle for
angular's two-way data-binding data gets
set initially in the controller then
when the ng-controller directive is
added to the template the template now
has the context for its expressions when
the expressions change in the template
the controller is updated let's see all
this in action see how angular added an
NG scope class to this div when angular
compiled this template it's all this
directive and created a scope object
that's associated with this element so
when it came to the expressions in the
template it could resolve them from the
scope checking the scope for the div
shows us a lot of information the scope
has an ID it also has a parent scope
inside our parent scope is our menu
property with the data from the
controller in the list of properties on
the scope object is dollar dollar
Watchers this is a list of things that
angular is watching for for changes
there's one watcher for each expression
here's the one to watch the menu image
property for changes if angular seas are
changing one of the Watchers then it
will update the property in either the
controller or the template at first it's
hard to understand how two-way
data-binding works between templates and
controllers in angular scope is the key
that binds them together and performs
updates when either side changes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
