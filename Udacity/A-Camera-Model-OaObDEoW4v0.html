details on how images are captured from
these cameras and try to get into some
representations of how mathematically we
can look at all of this here we will
basically start off with an image that
we want to capture and this is my sensor
as we looked on the image our processing
on image representations most of the
time we represent an image and this form
with x and y or columns and rows of
course the 3d world has this coordinate
axes y of x and z which could be
sometimes in this case b perspective as
we go down into the scene so imagine if
this is my object in the scene what
would it actually look like in a 3d
camera so to help us kind of get into
understanding this kind of concept of a
camera model let's imagine I have an
object in this 3d scene to help us we
will actually unwrap this and now i'm
showing the z axis and this way x and y
it's our kind of turned it around and
looking at the scene from this direction
and that that basically is the way i'm
looking at here so this is my object
again shown here basically i'm just
going to give it some value x y&amp;amp;z which
basically is this point here of this
object we can basically look at all of
the values so x is this z is this sorry
Z is Z would be this value X is this
value and why would be up how high this
object is of course the tracing the rate
through and imagine this to be a pinhole
so this is my pin hole off the camera
itself rate goes through here and of
course on the other side I should be
able to now think about where the image
would be formed will get an inverted
image on that side there and of course
it's on that side of the x axis and this
would be the value in the image plane on
the sensor and it's my sensor this is
where the image forms on that side of
the camera so the camera pinhole is here
the sensor is here 3d scene is here we
know that of course the sensor should be
at the focal plane now using similar
triangles we can actually start finding
out more information about where the
values of this would be the similar
triangles basically says that the ratio
of X I over F which is X I over F should
be the same as X naught which is this
value here so X I is this and focal
length of course is this similarly X 0
is this and in place of F we have the Z
value here so X I or f is equal to X
naught over Z naught and similarly for y
we can do the same thing and come up
with this equation we can simplify this
to now be able to get the values of x I
and why I with this relationship so as
long as I know of course the how far the
object is from the scene and where it is
I should be able to now figure out where
the pixel value would be on that image
itself of course me not not all the time
do we know these values from the real
world especially just from image</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
