compound inequality if you got it right
nice work if we stack the number lines
on top of each other like this we can
see that there's a region of
intersection these are the numbers that
are shared between the inequalities they
make both of the inequalities true and
this is why we learned about
intersections and really helps us figure
out what numbers make both inequalities
true we can see this region intersection
on one number line this is the solution
set we can also write it in interval
notation so notice that an and compound
inequality makes an intersection our
region between points and any of these
numbers would work in both inequalities
let's check that out real quick let's
check six we're going to let x equals 6
and check the Solutions so plug it in
six I get seven is less than or equal to
9 and plugging 6 over here i get
negative 8 is less than or equal to
negative 7 both of these statements are
true so that means six is a solution to
this compound inequality notice that
four equations and inequalities we've
always been able to check our answer
this is what's so great we can know that
we're right checking your answer can
build your confidence and knowing that
you're right or it means hey maybe I
should go back and check my work</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
