message from Atlanta to San Francisco
and to make it easier let's assume that
we want to send a simple message which
consists of 10 coin flips or the output
of 10 coin flips let us construct 2
messages out of coin flips I have 2
coins but you see these coins are
different because this one has a heads
and a tails at two different sides and
this one has both the sides which are
very similar looking so it's a biased
coin so every time I flip it's always
going to have the same state while when
I flip this it might either end up here
50% of the times or end up here 50% of
the time so construct two messages after
flipping both of them and recording what
their state is so here it is I did ten
coin flips with the fair coin I got a
few heads a few tails in this particular
sequence the unfair coin I'm calling
every state as a head state and I
basically saw ten heads all right if you
also observe the fair coin
I have like five heads and five tails so
the probability so it's so it is a fair
coin I got five heads and five tails so
it is a fair coin so if I had to
transmit this sequence how many bits of
message will I require let's assume that
I can represent this sequence using ten
binary digits zero representing heads
one representing tails and I can write
down this sequence as zeros and once
using ten bits I can also write down the
same sequence with the of the unfair
coin using those ten binary digits so I
will get something like 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
here everything will be zeros now let's
assume I have to transmit this to
particular sequences from Atlanta to San
Francisco what will be the size of each
message in case of the fair coin and the
unfair coin what do you think write down
your answers here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
