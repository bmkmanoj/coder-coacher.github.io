built on PHP Ruby on Rails JSP and so on
assemble the page and all of its content
as one before sending it down to the
browser progressive web apps change this
model by separating the parts that
change often essentially the content
from the parts that don't change often
typically called the application shell
the app shell can download and display
the content and may even store the
content in a local database so that it
can operate on slow networks or even if
there is no network connection available
the apps shell is the minimum HTML CSS
and JavaScript that is required to power
the user interface of a progressive web
app and is one of the components that
ensures reliably good performance its
first load should be extremely quick and
then immediately be cached on repeat
visits this allows you to get meaningful
pixels on screen without the network
even if your content eventually comes
from their app shell architecture
separates the core application
infrastructure and the UI from the data
all of the UI and infrastructure is
cached locally using a serviceworker so
that on subsequent loads the progressive
web app only needs to retrieve the
necessary data instead of having to load
everything put another way the app shell
is similar to the bundle of code that
you'd publish to an app store when
building a native app it is the core
components necessary to get your app off
the ground but does not likely contain
any data using the app shell
architecture and caching its resources
using a serviceworker allows you to
focus on speed giving your progressive
web app similar properties to that of
native apps instant loading regular
updates and all without the need of an
app store service workers are powerful
for offline caching but they also offers
sniffing performance wins in the form of
instant loading for repeat visits to
your site or app you can cast your
application shell so that it works
offline and populate its content using
JavaScript</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
