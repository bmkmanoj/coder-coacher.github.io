differently on the face and in our voice
each emotion has its own unique
combination of facial muscles and voice
changes often involving pitch let's take
fear for example this involves the
eyebrows being lifted and pulled
together and the upper eyelids are also
lifted and the lips are stretched and
pulled apart anger on the other hand the
eyebrows were lowered and pulled
together the eyelids are tightened in
the lips or thinned and pressed together
one interesting application of analyzing
facial expressions of emotion is being
able to distinguish which emotions being
expressed based strictly on muscle
movements we know or we think we know
what someone's feeling just by their
face they tell us when they're sad angry
disgusted or happy just with their face
and as it turns out sometimes we can be
fooled a happy face is not always a
genuinely happy face there are in fact
differences in the muscle movements of a
true smile and a social smile or a fake
smile</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
