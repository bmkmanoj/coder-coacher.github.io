that I want to delve into is the notion
of solution concepts hmm now we've
actually talked about various solution
concepts in game theory one in game
theory too but we never actually I don't
think sort of explain what they were or
even pointed out that we were talking
about different solution concept so do
you we need to talk about the concept of
solution context that's right we need to
talk about the concept of concepts
because its concepts all the way down
alright so here's the basic idea a
solution concept or really just a
concept is basically just a rule for
predicting how a game is going to be
played right so the one that we spent
the most time on was Nash hmm as a
solution concept in particularly Nash
equilibrium and so in the notion in the
language of solution concepts you're
basically saying that there's a rule
there's a kind of formal process by
which some particular games going to be
played and that is you're going to play
with the idea that you're getting into a
Nash equilibrium an equilibrium in
general and a Nash equilibrium in
particular mmm because it makes sense
mm-hmm so we talked about a few others
and mentioned a few others so we talked
about Nash at length and what made nasha
nashe was that the all the players were
playing in a way that they couldn't
unilaterally improve right so they were
doing best responses to whatever it was
the other player was getting right but
actually that wasn't really what made it
Nash so much well it was but the big
emphasis there is actually on
equilibrium the idea is that you were in
an equilibrium because it was in no
individuals best interest to move or to
change in any way and the particular
kind of equilibrium we talked about
one's Nash equilibria okay so in fact I
want to talk about correlated
equilibrium mmm because that's a
different kind of equilibrium that's
still an equilibrium but is different
from Nash and in some ways turns out to
be better under certain circumstances
and I'm going to even argue that in fact
we use correlated equilibria all the
time in real life I'll give you an
example that at the end but it's
correlated so related to Nash yes it is
and in a very particular way and I will
tell you how in a moment awesome okay so
we're going to talk about correlated
equal urban because that's what I'm
interested in but I should point out
that there are several others there's
trembling hand there's Stackelberg
competitions their sub game perfect we
actually talked about sub game perfect
and when I say we I mean you right in
the context of multistage game
sequential games right game theory too
but it's still a solution concept so
this notion of concepts and solution
concepts is not limited to simple matrix
games but actually all of these work
whether the games are repeated or not
okay there's also Bay's Nash we did not
talk about that Coco you mentioned Coco
hmm but I'm not going to talk about that
and there a whole bunch of others and
they just kind of go on and on and on
and i think when i talk about correlated
equilibrium and explain how it's a
solution concept and tied back to nash
you might see various other ways you
might come up with solution concepts ok
I mean trembling hands sort of scares me
a little bit but are we going to go into
any details about that and Stackelberg
no i am not going to talk about this i'm
not going to talk about this I'll
talking to talk about this i'm not going
to talk about this and you know what I'm
not gonna talk about this I'm gonna talk
about sound fair sounds like a segue
sounds like a segue</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
