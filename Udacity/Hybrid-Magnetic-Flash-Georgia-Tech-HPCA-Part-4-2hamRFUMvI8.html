combine the magnetic disks with flash
the magnetic disk is very cheap per
gigabyte compared to flash we know how
to build huge capacity magnetic disks in
a relatively small package but it's very
power hungry it spins and consumes power
even when not you accessing data and
it's very slow because it has to
mechanically move things around in order
to access data and another disadvantage
of magnetic disks is that they're
sensitive to impact like if they fall
down and hit the ground while they're
spinning because their heads are then
likely to scratch the surface of the
disc and permanently damage the whole
track possibly and maybe the head itself
flash on the other hand is fast power
efficient and has no moving parts so if
it falls down it might get damaged but
it's very unlikely so the idea is to
have both of them and use the flash
effectively as a cache for the disk that
way most of the data is on the disk but
the data we are frequently accessing is
on the flash where it's fast it can be
accessed without moving parts and it can
be accessed very efficiently now of
course the disk would still be spinning
if we occasionally access it but if we
have enough flash to access data in it
for even minutes at a time we can
actually power down to this can spin it
down and only really access it once we
have a flash miss and because both of
these can keep their data without power
if we turn off power suddenly the data
in the flash will still survive and so
will the data on the disk unlike for
example if we use a magnetic disk with a
dram cache to keep the most recently
accessed data</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
