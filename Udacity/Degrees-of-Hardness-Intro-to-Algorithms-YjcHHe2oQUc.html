what you need to do to prove an upper
bound on the hardness of a problem is if
you can find an algorithm for example
that solves the problem provably solve
the problem in provably into the fourth
time then what we don't know if a
bastard algorithm exists but we know
it's at least solvable and n to the
fourth so the Big O or big theta that we
get from that is exactly the upper bound
these sorts of things are really helpful
to do well actually sir the first one is
really helpful to do run it on a bunch
of inputs look at the shape of the graph
that can give you a lot of insight that
might help you decide what you want to
prove about the algorithm but this
itself doesn't really prove anything
running something on all possible inputs
is impossible unless it's a problem
where the inputs are constrained so
there's only a few possible inputs
generally the running time scales with
the size of the input and it could scale
arbitrarily large and yeah actually
studying algorithms and how to analyze
it is exactly what we're doing in this
