case but the memory pressure on P is
excessive ated in this case in this case
there's so much memory pressure that all
of the physical memory that's available
at p is being consumed by the working
set for hosting all the applications
running on hospi there's no community
service happening on host P and now if
there is another page fault for some new
page on P then there's no other option
on host P except to throw out some page
from its current working set in order to
make room for this missing page so we're
going to do exactly similar to what we
did in the previous case with the only
difference that the candidate that is
being chosen as a victim or the
replacement candidate which is called
the victim
in the management of virtual memory
system is coming from the local part of
host P itself so we get the missing page
and we send out the oldest page from
local part of host Peak recognizing that
the global part is zero right now so in
this case you can see that there is no
change in the distribution of local and
global on P because global was already 0
cannot go anything less than that so the
distribution remains unchanged and as in
the previous case there is no change on
host q as well in terms of the split
between local and global</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
