compared to real I want to go over some
facts that help justify the ideal cash
model remember that the ideal cash model
seemed to have some superpowers so a
technical question is are the
assumptions of the ideal cash model too
strong what I want to do now is go over
the justification from the original
cache oblivious model paper which was by
free go at all and appeared in the
foundations of computer science or Fox
1999 the first fact is about the
assumption of optimal replacement it's a
lemma and here's what it says suppose
you take your algorithm and you count
the number of cache misses it incurs on
a machine with an LRU replacement policy
now suppose you're given a different
machine this machine has the same line
size but it only has half the cash it
also implements an optimal replacement
policy rather than in lr you policy in
other words it has a better replacement
policy but it has less space it's both
slightly better being optimal but also
slightly worse having less space the
lemma says that the number of transfers
on the LRU machine will be within a
factor of two of the number of transfers
on this slightly better slightly worse
optimal machine now I know what you
might be thinking huh what the mood a
little bit at first glance this lemma
may seem a bit odd but here's a very
natural interpretation suppose you
design an algorithm assuming optimal
replacement which is what we're going to
be doing then the performance of that
algorithm on a more realistic LRU
machine will be asymptotically close in
other words optimal replacement isn't as
strong and assumption as you might think
now there's a more specific technical
requirement which is one of regularity
we say Q opt is regular if it's Big O of
Q opt with twice the cash in other words
let's say you design an algorithm and
you find out what Q opt is on a machine
with an optimal replacement policy what
you calculate for Q opt is regular if Q
opt is big-oh of Q opt with twice the
cash so if you can show that Q opt is
regular in this sense then qlr you will
be proportional to Q opt</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
