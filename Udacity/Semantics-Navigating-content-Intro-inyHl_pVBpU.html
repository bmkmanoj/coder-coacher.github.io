semantics and how assistive technologies
use the accessibility tree to create an
alternative user experience we also took
a look at how we can write expressive
HTML which makes this process as
straight fold as possible right writing
semantic HTML gives it a lot of
accessibility out-of-the-box information
such as form fields links and a lot of
complex behavior is given to you for
free I'd like to talk about a different
aspect of accessibility though and that
is how does a screen reader user
actually finds and then reach the
information in the page right yeah we
haven't talked about how you actually
get around a page using a screen reader
on something like a flight booking site
we looked at in the last lesson there's
really not a lot of content on the page
so it's not a big deal to just read the
whole thing from the top but on
something like a newspaper front page or
an email application like Gmail it's not
really going to be practical to read
through every single thing until you
find what you're looking for because you
never get anything done so true actually
you'd be surprised how many people when
they start learning about screen readers
assume that it's so difficult and
tedious to use and to compensate for
their assumption they tend to do things
like making every element on the webpage
focusable so that a screen reader user
has an easier time getting to them i've
been using screen buren since my college
years and today i'd like to show you
just how it works</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
