we've made it all the way through now
let's try to summarize what it is that
we've covered in this unit two large
extent this unit was about tools how to
build useful tools how to recognize what
they are and put them together and how
to apply them to components of a domain
and in particular one of the important
tools we looked at his language the
ability to define the language that you
want to deal with rather than the
language that Python happens to give you
and we talked about grammars that
describe a language interpreters that
interpret them and compilers that do the
same thing only faster and the other
main lesson in this unit with functions
that functions two are very powerful
tool and they're powerful in a way that
statements are not so with statements
although in the end we need our
statements to write our programs they
have this flaw and that they're not as
composable less functions are if you
want to reuse a statement somewhere else
the only thing you have to do is copy
and paste and that's an issue that can
be a problem because then you got
multiple copies and you update one but
you don't update the other with
functions you compose them rather than
copy and paste them and so that that
means there's one function that's an
object and that gets reused
automatically and when you change it it
gets changed everywhere because there's
one object not multiple copies with copy
and paste so that's the advantages of
functions we talked about decorators as
functions we showed how to use functions
as objects and we showed some patterns
for how they fit together and allow us
to define tools I hope you found this
all useful and I think you'll see in the
homework assignments we have for this
unit that the difficulty has been
stepped up a bit but you should be able
to handle them with the tools that we've
covered</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
