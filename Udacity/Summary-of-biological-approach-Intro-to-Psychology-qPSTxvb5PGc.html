biological approach first we have drug
therapy remember that with the
development of the neuroleptics or
antipsychotics we found effective
treatments for people with schizophrenia
recall that the drugs were the
phenothiazines
including chlorpromazine and that core
promazine reduced the positive symptoms
associated with schizophrenia such as
the delusions and the hallucinations
recall also that we have three classes
of drugs that have been used to treat
depression and those are the mao
inhibitors the tricyclics and the SSRIs
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors
these have all been proven to be
effective in the treatment of depression
we also discussed that the SSRIs are
used to treat anxiety as well we also
mentioned briefly that the tricyclics
are sometimes used for treating chronic
pain and for bedwetting and also for the
treatment of ADHD in addition we
discussed the use of both the
benzodiazepines and the barbiturates in
the treatment of anxiety but that the
benzodiazepines are preferred over the
barbiturates because they are safer we
also discussed the long-term negative
consequences of using the
benzodiazepines as they are cognitive
inhibitors also you read about lithium
and then it's been prescribed for a long
time because of its ability to stabilize
the mania associated with bipolar
disorder and we also have the stimulants
the stimulants help improve a person's
ability to concentrate and recall that
also from the biological approach are
the psycho surgeries that we discussed
briefly you'll recall that we talked
about the prefrontal lobotomy and then
it produced tragic effects and is no
longer in use today so this material
here is for a historical perspective to
see how far we've actually come in the
area of psychology so lobotomy remember
is not used today
we also discussed electro convulsive
therapy or ECT and its use in the
treatment of major depressive disorder
recall here that an electric current is
passed through the person's brain in
order to induce a seizure and afterwards
people report an app
of their depression symptoms and finally
we discussed repetitive transcranial
magnetic stimulation also for the
treatment of depression so together for
the biological approach we had our drug
therapies as well as our psycho
surgeries</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
