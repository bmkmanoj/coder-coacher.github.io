flashy stores and for within quiz we
have this five stage pipeline we said
already that for control dependencies we
have to use flushes we have fetched the
wrong instructions delaying them or
trying to fix the values they read is
not gonna help us so here we have to
flush and we don't stall or form for
this data dependence at the time when
the load is reading the R one here the
multiply is producing the result here
the multiply has the result at the end
of that cycle and the load will need to
compute the address at the beginning of
the next cycle so here we can forward
the value of R 1 from the multiply to
load and don't have to stall again we
don't want to use flushes here the final
question is whether the load result of R
1 which needs to be fed to the adhere
can be forwarded or do we have to stall
when the add is reading R 1 here the
load is here computing the address it
still has not accessed memory in the
next cycle the ad is computing using the
wrong value of R 1 while the load is
still loading memory so the load only at
the end of this cycle has the proper
value of R 1 whereas the ad at the end
of that cycle has already computed the
wrong result so in this case we have to
stall interesting enough we will
actually after that one stall cycle
forward to avoid stalling more so we
here we have to have a stall and we can
after the stall do forwarding or just
stall more but this is one of those
situations where forwarding cannot help
you you have to stall for a data
dependence</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
