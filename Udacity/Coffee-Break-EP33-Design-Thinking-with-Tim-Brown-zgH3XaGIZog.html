break I'm Chelsey Glasson leave user
researcher here at Udacity I've also
spent the last several months working as
course developer for the course the
design of everyday things and I'd like
to share with you one of my favorite
clips from the class that consists of a
conversation between Don Norman and Tim
Brown the CEO and president of I do
enjoy so Tim Design Thinking one of the
points you argue is that it doesn't just
make you a better designer it makes you
better at anything tell us about that
I've always thought is the one of the
wonderful things about being is being a
designer is not just that I get to work
on lots of exciting projects but it
helps me my life right so I and when
it's something as simple as I'm going to
throw a bit a dinner party for some
friends so I start instead of just
turning up at you know seven o'clock and
thinking about what I'm going to make is
she designed that I try and design that
experience I think well Who am I going
to bring together and what's the space
going to be like and how does the food
and the space work together all these
things that I naturally think about as a
designer
um and I think that's what design
thinking does for you it's a set of
tools that allows you to approach life
particularly the parts of life where it
might be advantageous to solve a problem
differently and it allows you to
approach that with some level of kind of
confidence because you've got some ways
of going about it and we have many we're
taught at school many ways of analyzing
problems of put picking them apart and
studying little pieces of them that's
very valuable but but Design Thinking
gives you a different way of tackling a
problem often often ones that centered
around the needs of the people you're
trying to solve for that might be
yourself it might be a customer in if
you're in a professional environment it
might be your colleagues in a work at
the work environment but it's centered
around that and so it starts with
thinking hard looking hard listening
hard and trying to study people and
understand in this instance what their
issues might be what the problems might
be how they're thinking how they how
they're how they're navigating the world
or dealing with the world
at hand and then using that as the
starting point for having ideas</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
