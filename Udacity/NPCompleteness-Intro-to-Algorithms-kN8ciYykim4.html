finally define this notion of NP
completeness that I mentioned in the
beginning of the unit we can say some
problem X is np-complete if it satisfies
two properties first it has to be
np-hard
meaning that nothing in the set NP is
harder than X which is to say that if
you could solve X in polynomial time you
could use it to solve everything in NP
in polynomial time and the second
important property is that X itself is
in NP so it's in the set and it's as
hard as anything in the set so it is in
fact the hardest in the set and though
it may seem a little weird to satisfy
both of these at the same time there's
actually tons of problems known to be
np-complete very often when you go to
solve some to develop some kind of
algorithm for solving a problem and it
just doesn't feel like there's any way
to get a foothold on it it's a good idea
to check is it np-hard and is it n NP if
so it's np-complete and at this point
now tons of problems are known to be
np-complete there's there's lists
there's online websites that list lots
of problems there's there's wonderfully
written books that that layout problem
after problem after problem and
sometimes they're really natural
extensions of each other and sometimes
it's really quite interesting to see how
they're connected to each other saying
that some problem is np-complete tells
us an awful lot about that problem so
let's imagine that there's some problem
called graph partitioning which is a
real problem and it is related to social
networks but I'm not going to tell you
what it is but I will tell you that it's
np-complete now even though you don't
know what it is there are some things
that you do know by virtue of the fact
that it that it's np-complete assuming
you believe me you'd know the following
thing so which of these check all that
apply which ones do you know if I tell
you the Kraft partitioning Zen
p-complete
does that mean it's np-hard and
therefore that a polynomial time
solution for that problem solves
everything in NP do we know that the
problem clique can be reduced to it
given what we've said so far in this
unit about clique do we know that graph
partitioning is in NP and therefore that
an exponential time solution would exist
do we also know or do we know that it
can be reduced to Sat based on the
things I've told you about sat in this
unit so check all that apply</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
