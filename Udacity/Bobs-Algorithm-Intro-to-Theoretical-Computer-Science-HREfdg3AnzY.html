running time of Bob's algorithm is 2 to
the power of n times n squared which is
just the same running time as the
algorithm that Alice was using and the
reasons are also very similar to it so
if you have n jeans then again there's 2
to the power of n assignments of 0 and 1
to the jeans and checking if an
assignment is valid so checking if all
genes that have a 1 are connected we'll
also take oo of n squared time so that
of course depends a bit on how many ones
there are in the assignment but a
worst-case analysis would be here that
close to n jeans have been assigned one
so we need to check all of their
connections which similar to Alice's
algorithm you already know there are
about n squared many of them so Bob
similar to Alice has so far only found
an algorithm that is totally impractical
for the problem that he's trying to
solve because it has exponential running
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
