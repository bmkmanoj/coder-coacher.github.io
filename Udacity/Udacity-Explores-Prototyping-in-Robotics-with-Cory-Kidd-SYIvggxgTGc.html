robot interaction and this technology
and building this technology obviously
the idea of prototyping in building the
actual physical robot and there's a lot
of work and a lot of studies that have
been done on how to build a robot right
so what are some of the things that you
do like Italian you were designing maybe
so you know in the early days of
building you know the application that
we're doing in terms of what's going to
interact with patients we didn't need
the actual physical robot right that
could be built in parallel so we started
testing things out with patients
now again didn't have a robot yet so the
very first robot we had was he was a
little blue recycling bins we took one
of those we turned it upside down put
two googly eyes on it and tape the
tablet to it with some mock-up software
running on it right and went and put
that in front of patients that was our
first version right next version we got
much more advanced we took that and we
put a Bluetooth speaker inside of it and
one of our writers was in the next room
acting as the robot any kind of
interactions actually told us a lot and
because we could constrain things in
such a way that we were trying to solve
particular challenges trying to think
about how we would introduce those with
people and what kind of conversation
should we have right we could constrain
what conversations we were having on our
end and see what people did and we got
it was pretty amazing you know you put
this blue trashcan down in front of
someone and the first thing they're
going to look at you like you're a
little bit crazy but then you start
having a conversation to get right into
it and we've got videos of some of our
early patient testers who were using
this and you know they start opening up
after about 60 90 seconds of talking to
this right totally forget that it's a
blue trashcan sitting in front of them
but getting right into what we were
trying to get so you can achieve a lot
with building very little hardware and
software if you want to think about the
user experience and the user interaction
side of a building robot and so again we
were doing these in parallel right part
of its building the hardware because
ultimately we want a product that we can
put in front of a patient have them
interact with but we can start doing a
lot of the design of that before you
know well before we have the actual
robot so why do you think it was that if
you could put just a blue trash can with
some googly eyes in front of people that
they would open up and kind of feel this
connection what do you think it is about
that that so it kind of triggers that
yeah so
it's a great question it comes down to
you know really what we focus on here it
could tell you health which is not so
much the technology right the technology
is in support of the real problems that
we're trying to solve and just how do we
engage a patient keep them engaged for
longer in their own healthcare and for
us that comes down to really three
things
so what we're building is the
intersection of your medicine medical
best practices so in a particular group
of Asia
dealing with a certain condition or
disease and a certain treatment what are
the best practices like what do we need
to be talking to this patients about one
of the things that we follow up on with
them too with psychology really a few
types of psychology so in particular
psychology of relationships how do we as
people create build up and maintain a
relationship over time as well as some
aspects of the psychology behavior
change and a few other things that we
draw from here and then ultimately for
us those are tied together with our
artificial intelligence algorithms so
that's how we're really generating a
conversation in real time for that
patient now those first two though don't
require the AI algorithms and those are
the things that we can start testing
right away right we know what kind of
conversations were going to build we may
not be ready to deliver them purely
through software when we start doing our
testing but we can create those
conversations we can have those
conversations with a patient and
ultimately those conversations that we
have using humans with our patients same
as the doctor or a nurse is going to
have that's what we want to be building
into our technology right so the
technology is what ultimately gets us to
the point where we can have this
conversation in a very scalable way
across tens or hundreds of thousands or
millions of patients having those
conversations with you know a speaker
inside of an upside upside down
recycling bin right is a great way to
start to get us there and really
understanding the nature of that
interaction because again for us it
really comes back to the psychology
right how do you how do you actually
engage that person it shouldn't matter
whether it's a robot doing it or a
person doing it obviously there are some
differences right and that's stuff that
we've studied along the way and many
other people now have as well but the
nature of those conversations you can
deliver through many different means
yeah I think you can on something that's
really kind of important when you talk
about robotics because a lot of people
think when you're working with robots
it's just tech right it's the algorithms
it's the hardware right and
that's not the point typically as a
robot right point typically of a robot
is to solve a problem exactly in an
efficient way right right or in a way
that's not achievable otherwise so doing
what you've done
and kind of focusing you're just saying
this is the tech and the tech kind of
just fits in right it might not be the
most it doesn't need to be cutting-edge
it needs to be reliable and it needs to
work well in the situations that we need
to test it in and then we can move
forward to actually solving the bigger
problem exactly which i think is great
looking at these interactions with this
Bluetooth speaker under the bin I'm
actually really kind of it's kind of
blowing my mind that that's the actual
approach that you went with whether your
first prototype what kind of prototype I
guess did you bring to investors first
of all and what was the reaction once
you brought it to an event to investors
typically so we've talked to a lot of
different investors in the life of this
company or you know even starting before
the company officially existed right so
started talking to investors about three
years ago now and you know it's very
early days you know we didn't have a
trash can yet it was really concept
raised money you know initial angel
money based on that right really on the
concept now you know I should say in the
background you know before this I built
the first version of this and deployed
it with patients ten years ago so it's
not like this is a brand new concept
there's a lot of you know academic and
medical research behind how and why this
is going to work but in terms of
catelleya health and this company raised
the initial money before any prototype
for hardware or software existed now the
bulk of our first seed round came after
we had a prototype that started to look
like what the real product does now
right so the more you know as with any
company right the more you get in terms
of fidelity and closeness to a real
product real customers obviously you
know that makes it much easier story
with investors and so for us in the
early days it was really about here's
the problem that we're focused on
solving here's the technology that we're
going to be building here's why we as a
team are good to build that right in
part because I have done this before and
built this kind of technology
successfully delivered it to patients
and here's where we think we're going
and why we can get there sir
time line so that was a lot of that
message in in the early days of
fundraising for can tell you health</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
