common types of charts and learned about
how the grammar of graphics helps us
separate data from our visual
representation of metadata I want to
show you how to put this theory into
practice using d3 and associate
technologies as covered in Lesson one
the visualization stack for different
technologies can go pretty deep at the
top of the spectrum we have graphical
tools such as raw or Excel that let us
very quickly and easily create
predefined charts for our data but lack
flexibility at the low end of the
spectrum are technologies like canvas
WebGL and SVG itself these low-level
tools at the bottom of the spectrum are
the most flexible but give you an
interface similar to a painter you must
specify pixels and colors to do
something even as simple as drawing a
line and just forget about making
dynamic charts and binding data since we
will be working somewhere in the middle
of this spectrum when working with
charts I do not yet want to deal with
all the complexities of radi 3d three is
often confused for a charting library
when in fact it exists at one level
lower and also one level below the
grammar of graphics and think of d3 as
the building blocks that someone might
use if they want to create a charting
library with Excel like plotting
functionality and that is exactly what
many people have done we will be using a
library called dimple j/s for this live
coding example it's implemented on top
of d3 which in turn is implemented on
top of SVG javascript and HTML and
provides us a very nice abstraction for
building charts and allows us to think
in the way that we might want to when
considering the grammar of graphics</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
