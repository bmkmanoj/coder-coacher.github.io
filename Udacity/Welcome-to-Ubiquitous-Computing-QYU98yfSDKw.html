okay
one two welcome to ubiquitous computing
I'm Timothy Jordan a developer advocate
at Google and I'm Wayne Piekarski also
developer advocate at Google and I'm
Josh Gordon and you guessed it also a
developer advocate at Google as you
learn in this course ubiquitous
computing is simply a fancy phrase for
technology that's accessible to the user
whenever and wherever they want or need
it perhaps they're outside going for a
run or having some friends over to watch
cat videos and play games well maybe
it's time for a road trip your users can
be in any of those situations and you
don't want them to have to think about
what device they need to get to your
service no you want an experience that
presents itself to the user wherever it
makes sense by building an app that runs
on whatever devices they happen to have
nearby in this course we'll teach you
about the existing platforms and tools
that can make your app available on a
variety of form factors but before we
get started I'll explain just a little
bit more about what it means for your
app to be ubiquitous</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
