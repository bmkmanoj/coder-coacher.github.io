and today we're going to talk about it
and a set in Python is simply an
unordered collection of elements with no
duplicates and this unordered and no
duplication these are important clauses
the sets used by Python are just a
programmatic version of the sets used by
mathematicians so let's talk a bit about
set theory let's say we have a basket of
fruit and I don't know let's say it
contains five apples three oranges and
two tomatoes these I suppose would be
the apples or maybe the tomatoes but we
don't to worry about that if we wouldn't
represent this as a set we wouldn't care
about this quantity so the fact that
there's five apples doesn't matter in
fact I could just write Apple orange and
tomato and label this set fruit the
elements of this set fruit are simply
the entries apple orange and tomato now
let's say we also have a set called
vegetable and some of the elements in
this set would be broccoli carrot and
tomato when I was coming up with this
question there was some heated debate in
the office about whether tomatoes are
fruits or vegetables so let's just
include it in both that means that when
I draw the circle that encompasses this
set it actually has an overlap with the
set fruit and in set theory this overlap
is called the intersection and I'm gonna
mention these set theory terms but you
don't have to worry about them too much
this diagram I've drawn here is known in
set theory as a Venn diagram and they
can be very useful for visualizing
what's going on with sets now here comes
the interesting part we can create new
sets by taking subsections or performing
operations on these sets for example if
we want to know what elements are fruits
and vegetables which like I said before
is called the intersection we could
write fruit ampersand vegetable and we
could see the only element would be
tomato I should point out that this
symbol and the other symbols I will be
using are not what we usually use in
mathematical set theory but since
they're what we use in Python I'm going
to be sticking with this convention we
could also ask what elements are fruits
but not vegetables which is known as the
set difference and the only elements
that are fruits been on vegetables are
apple and orange
we could ask which elements are fruits
or vegetables and here I've used the
vertical line to indicate that and this
would give us all of these entries all
of these entries are either a fruit or
vegetable or both the last operation I'm
going to talk about is asking which
elements are fruits or vegetables but
not both and this is known as the
symmetric difference and here we've used
the carrot to indicate that which is not
the same as this carrot and this is just
all of the entries except for tomato</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
