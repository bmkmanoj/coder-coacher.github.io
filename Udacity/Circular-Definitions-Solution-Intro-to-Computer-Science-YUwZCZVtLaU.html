of these restrictions we still don't
have a good definition so let's consider
all the restrictions so the first one
was if everyone is friends with Alice
so that would only work if they don't
have any other friends let's say this is
Alice we've got Bob and Charlie they're
both friends with Alice but Bob is also
friends with charlie and charlie is
friends with Bob that means that to
figure out the popularity of Bob we need
to know the popularity of Charlie to
figure out the popularity of Charlie we
need to know the popularity of Alice as
well as the popularity of Bob so we're
never gonna get to a solution
we're gonna keep bouncing back and forth
between Bob and Charlie doing this the
second choice only if no one is friends
with Alice well if no one was friends
with Alice that would remove these links
doesn't solve our problem we're still
not going to be able to give a
popularity score for Bob and Charlie the
third choice only if there's a
friendship path from everyone in the
graph that eventually reaches Alice so
adding this link would provide that
property but it still doesn't solve our
problem it doesn't give us a way to
figure out the popularity of Charlie
because to know that we need to know the
popularity of Bob which we need to know
the popularity of Charlie for we still
end up in this cycle the final choice
seems possibly more promising it says
there are no cycles in the graph so if
we want to remove the cycle we could do
this in this case we'd be okay right we
could figure out the popularity of Bob
by figure the popular Charlie which
depends on the popularity of Alice where
we're not okay is if Bob has another
friend let's say Bob is friends with
Diana well then to figure out the
popularity of Diana we need to know the
popularity of Bob where it breaks down
is suppose we also have Diana and Edgar
and Diana's friends with Edgar to figure
out the popularity of Diana we need to
know the popularity score of Edgar we
don't have a cycle but we don't have an
answer either to figure out the
popularity of Edgar we're gonna go
through Edgar's friends in the way the
Python code is written this could
actually work right because if we
defined popularity when you have no
friends well if the friends at P is
empty when we go through this loop the
score is going
zero so if you answered there no cycles
that's at least worth credit for this
that could be correct in terms of in the
mathematical definition it doesn't make
very good sense we still needed a way to
know the popular Edgar we've sorted to
find things in this case to say if you
have no friends your popularity score is
zero and the Python code will work for
that but it's not a good way to define
popularity so it's very arbitrary to say
we're gonna make Alice the one whose
popularity score is predefined as one
there's nothing Alice can do to make
herself more popular that's not very
fair to Alice and it doesn't give us
meaningful scores</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
