rotating is often the most convenient
order with our snowman the arms were
positioned by rotating then translating
here's the stick without any transforms
on it I've made the Snowman transparent
and remove the ground plane so we can
see the sticks position it's actually
inside the Snowman half way through the
ground whenever you create most
geometric objects in three j/s the
object is centered around the origin the
rotation along the x axis put the stick
into its proper orientation then the
translation moved it upwards and world
coordinates to the proper location let's
see what would happen if we first
translate it then rotated first we move
the stick upwards 50 units the center of
the stick is now in place in the middle
of the body so far so good now if we
rotate the stick after positioning it we
suddenly see it lying on the ground what
happened the problem is that the
rotation takes place with respect to the
origin in the first step we moved our
stick up above the origin in the second
we rotated the stick but it rotated
around the origin let's watch this
disaster in slow motion the stick starts
centered at the origin we move it
upwards 50 units now its center is at
the right height however when we then
apply a rotation the object rotates
around the origin down here instead of
rotating around its center finishing the
90 degree rotation the sticks landed on
the ground another way to think about it
is that translating an object moves its
center you're moving the object up
relative to the stick you're moving the
point it will rotate around down we've
established that scaling before rotating
is usually what we want and rotating
before translating is also generally
more useful this is why three j/s uses
this order scale rotate translate when
dealing with a single object</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
