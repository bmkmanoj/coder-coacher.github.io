got negative 3 or negative one-fifth
congratulations I would say that you
have mastered absolute value equations
let's see how we got those answers when
I have two absolute values that are
equal to each other I still have to make
two cases and the two cases for this
problem are going to be 3x plus 2 equals
the first case is going to be exactly
what's inside the absolute value which
is 2x minus 1 the second case we keep
the left side of the equation the same
and make the right-hand side of the
equation negative so i have negative 2x
minus 1 let's go ahead and solve these
first i subtract 2x from both sides when
i subtract 2x from both sides i get x
plus 2 equals negative 1 and when i
subtract two from both sides i get x
equals negative 3 so there's one of my
answers we have to be a little more
careful here i have negative parenthesis
2x minus 1 which means negative 1 times
2x minus 1 which means i need to
distribute that negative sign negative 1
x 2 x is negative 2x and negative 1
times negative 1 is positive 1 from here
I'm going to add 2x to both sides which
gives me 5x plus 2 equals one when i
subtract two from both sides i get 5x
equals negative 1 divide both sides by 5
and i get x equals negative one-fifth
that problem was more difficult than a
lot of the absolute value equations so
if you got the answer right I'd say
you've mastered absolute value equations
and we're ready to move on to absolute
value inequalities</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
