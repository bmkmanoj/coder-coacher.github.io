reiterate the one I just gave you before
is always automatically escape variables
when possible not every template
language will allow you to do so but I
always give it a look Jinja certainly
allows you to do so so in this class you
should definitely do that next is
minimize the code that you include in
templates what I've showed you so far is
statements and for loops that's about it
jinjo allow you to put almost like
arbitrary Python into your templates but
you know remember the whole reason we're
using templates in the first place so
that we don't have to have HTML in our
code likewise we don't have code in our
HTML because it makes it very difficult
to modify to edit to the bug all of
those things as a total pain so and of
course the inverse of this is minimize
your HTML in code
I Jenna I have a rule generally where we
have zero HTML in our code even if it's
a little one line thing we put it in a
template that way all your HTML is in
one place all your code is in one place
and you don't you're not using the wrong
tool for the wrong job which inevitably
will bite you down the road as your
projects get more and more complex so
those are just some things you know
these aren't hard and fast rules but
these are things that I've done that
have served me well over the years</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
