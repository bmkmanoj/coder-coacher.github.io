complicated so let's write some test
cases out
I'll index spots by row and column so
two two would be right here and that
spot should be blue so we need an
expression that when given two and two
gets zero the spot 3/3 should also be
blue so again we need a 0 2 3 should be
red so that should be a 1 and 3 2 should
be red so also 1 so what's an expression
I could try to use to turn 2 &amp;amp; 2 into 0
3 &amp;amp; 3 into 0 2 &amp;amp; 3 into 1 &amp;amp; 3 &amp;amp; 2 into 1
it kind of looks like maybe I'm taking
the mod of these and adding that
together so row mod 2 plus column mod 2
let's see what this gives in each case 2
mod 2 would be 0 0 &amp;amp; 0 gives 0 so that's
good
3 months 2 is 1 &amp;amp; 2 mod 2 is 0 so that
gives one the same will happen here this
one doesn't quite work 3 mod 2 is 1 &amp;amp; 3
mod 2 is also 1 so I would get 2 but
then maybe if I just mod the whole thing
by 2 again then I would get 0 which is
the same the two would turn into 0 and
the ones would stay so this expression
might work let's test it out in bluej
first I'll check my test and put some
actual values in it the test cases I
came up with were 2 2 3 3 2 3 &amp;amp; 3 to 4
to 2 I expected 0 and I expected the
same thing for 3 3 @ 2 3 I expected 1 so
1 and at 3 2 I also expected 1 so my
tester should be good to go
now I'll try putting that expression
into the actual program in the
checkerboard painter instead of
returning 5 I want to return
Roma - plus calm odd - and then all mod
- I don't have to put these in
parentheses because the plus has lower
precedence and let's try it if I run the
tester my actual and expected values
match up but could we make this any
simpler what if I noticed that adding an
even number plus an even number gives me
another even number and an odd number
plus an odd number gives me another even
number
but odd plus even or even plus odd both
give odd numbers then I could just add
row and column and take the mod - right
at the end because if they match their
sum is even and if they don't match the
sum is odd so I'll just get rid of the
mod - and the mod - if I change it in
the checkerboard painter erase that and
erase that what will my test say is this
still the same and if I run the test
again it still works as a bonus question
what if instead of returning zero when
they match and one when they don't match
I wanted to return one when they match
and zero when they don't match how would
you do that I won't go over it but it's
something to think about</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
