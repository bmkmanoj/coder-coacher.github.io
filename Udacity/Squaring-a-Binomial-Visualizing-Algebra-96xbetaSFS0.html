excellent work we know the first
rectangle is actually a square each side
is 2x so 2x times 2x is 4x squared this
rectangle would be 2x times 3 which
would be 6x the same is true for this
rectangle 2x times three makes 6 X and
finally for this last rectangle we would
have three times three for each of these
sides which makes nine when we multiply
2x plus 3 by itself we end up with this
perfect square this perfect square has
an area for x squared plus 12x plus 9
which we know isn't equal to 4x squared
plus 9 so to answer original question no
these are not equal all the way back
from unit one we said that squares can't
distribute over sums or differences if
we only square the first term and the
last term we miss out on these middle
terms of 6x these are considered to be
linear terms they only have one variable
with an exponent of one I know it's
really easy just to think about squaring
each of these terms to get this answer
but in this case the math goes against
our intuition it's not true this is what
makes floating math interesting and
sometimes the patterns aren't exactly
what they seem</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
