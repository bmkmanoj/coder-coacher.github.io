define add to index here's one way that
works so we're going to create a
procedure we'll call it add to index and
it takes our 3 inputs the index the
keyword and the URL what we need to do
in add the index is first find if the
keyword already appears so to do that we
need to look through all the entries in
index the natural way to do that is to
use a for loop so we're going to find
the procedure add to index and it takes
our 3 inputs index keyword and URL to
help keep track of what we're doing I'm
going to draw a reminder of what the
data structure of index is remember that
it's a list of entries and each entry is
itself a list where the first part is
the keyword and the second part is a
list of the URLs so that's our data
structure that's going to help us figure
out what to do to define add to index so
the first thing we need to do is to
check whether the keyword already exists
in the index if we can find it well then
we want to modify that entry rather than
creating a new one so the natural way to
do that is to use a for loop so we're
going to loop through the elements of
index we'll give each one the name entry
to use in the block so this is what
entry will be so the first time through
the loop the value of entry will be a
reference to the list here which is the
first element of the index list so now
we need to find the keyword so the
keyword is right here that's the element
at position 0 of entry so we're gonna
test is the value at position 0 and
entry identical to the keyword that's
passed in will use the double equal
comparison to test that if it is equal
what we found a match this means we want
to append the URL to the list of URLs
associated with that entry so to get
that list of URLs we want to find entry
1 that's the value at position 1 of
entry and we want to append to that the
new URL so here we've found an entry
that matches the keyword we were looking
for this means the keyword is already in
the index we've added the new URL to the
list of URLs associated with that
keyword and so we're done we have
nothing else to do what we want to make
sure is that we don't continue and do
anything else one approach would be to
you
break that would end the loop what we
want to do instead is really end the
whole procedure if we did break well
then we still have the problem of how do
we deal with the case where the keyword
wasn't found so here we're just going to
return we're all done with add to index
we've added the URL where it belongs now
we need to think about what to do in the
case where the keyword does not already
exist in the index if that's the case
then we get to the end of the loop
without ever finding that entry so if we
got to the end of the loop that means we
did not find any entry in the index that
matches the keyword then what we want to
do is add a new entry and that new entry
is going to have as its value a list
containing two elements it'll be the
keyword and as the second element we'll
have a list containing the URLs that we
found that have that keyword so far we
only have one the URL that was passed in
to add to index so how do we do that
will de add a new element to index we
use append and we need something to pass
in to append that's the structure that
we want to add this whole thing is what
we want to add so that's a list
containing the value keyword as its
first element as the second element it's
a list containing just the single URL so
that's what we want to append in the
case where we didn't find the keyword
already in the index</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
