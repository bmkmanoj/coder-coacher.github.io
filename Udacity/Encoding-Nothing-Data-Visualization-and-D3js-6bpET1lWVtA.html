perhaps a less salient part of Jon
Snow's map but it's certainly an
interesting one as it turns out the
brewery gave unen limited the allowance
to its workers and since the
fermentation process killed the cholera
bacteria none of the workers contracted
the disease you can read more about the
outbreak and jon snow's discovery in the
instructor notes his work in
visualization with a start of modern
epidemiology Jon Snow demonstrated how
data visualization can be used to trace
the spread of disease in this case a
single pump carrying contaminated water
throughout a community here's a
different interactive visualization that
comes from the Guardian which encodes
missing values in a slightly different
way this visualization displays the
extent to which gay rights are protected
by law in each of the states as of May
2012 states that have no laws or that
are unclear about the laws have this
light gray coloring and states that
prohibit our banned gay rights have the
striped pattern for example many states
in the Northeast have employment laws
which prohibit discrimination based on
sexual orientation and gender while most
states in the southeast and many in the
Midwest lacks such employment laws this
is an interesting visualization because
it makes use of texture or pattern to
represent different aspects about the
states for example this outer red ring
displays many states that prohibit or
banned same-sex marriage and this darker
blue inner ring shows a few states that
do not permit adoption by a single
person or join adoption by same-sex
couples between this visualization and
Jon Snow's map we can see that there are
many ways to encode values of zero
missing values or perhaps other
categorical values of data like in this
visualization so now I'd like to turn it
over to you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
