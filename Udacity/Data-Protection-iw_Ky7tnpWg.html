of how we're going to implement some of
those functions or those features first
of all we have to protect the data that
is used by the operating system or the
trusted computing base it must protect
itself remember one of the requirements
we had is that it should be tamper proof
so no one should be able to tamper with
it and that's only possible when it is
able to protect itself against that kind
of tampering so let's talk about some
security features of the trusted
operating systems that you have in terms
of protecting data and and other kind of
resources so one thing that we address
in these kind of systems is what is
called object reuse protection think of
various kind of objects of resources
memory pages for example this blocks so
what happens you allocate a memory page
21 process that process completes and
then goes away and then that page is
allocated to a different process well
what happens if that page had some
sensitive data that belong to the first
process this also applies to disk blocks
for persistent data okay if when a file
is deleted we may free up certain blocks
where the file data was stored and his
three blocks are free to be assigned to
somebody else and they could be but
there may be data already in these
blocks in fact there is one thing we can
do if we are concerned about a you know
having trust under system is that when
process is is allocating either disk
blocks of memory then we should be aware
of the fact that something could be left
behind in these reusable resources well
what can we do something is left behind
if the system is trusted it can zero out
these objects before we get reused so
before the memory block is given to the
new process to make sure that it doesn't
have access to the data that was stored
in that memory block or page by the last
process we can zero it out if we're
talking about a file deletion or data
that's written out on the disk we can
override it with various patterns of
zeros and ones and you know we have
secure deletion for example and that's
basically it's writing it one or more
times with some garbage or
and zeros and ones to make sure that the
old data that was there is no longer
there and you can sort of carry it even
further for example when you discard
your disks you actually destroy it you
degauss it or if it's do physical
destruction because one of the things I
reported number of years ago bunch of
students at MIT actually went to some
place and and bought some old PCs at
almost no cost and then pull out the
disks in those machines and they contend
all kind of sensitive data because even
if you either people don't delete files
even if you delete if we are not doing
some of these things we discussed here
which a trusted system should do the
data would still be there and and if
this gets in the hands of somebody else
then they will be able to sort of gain
access to the data so if you're building
a secure system you have to worry about
this idea of reuse of objects of
resources in particular memory objects
disk blocks and and how information
that's stored in them by a given process
or the system has to be wiped clean
before those resources are reallocated
to somebody else</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
