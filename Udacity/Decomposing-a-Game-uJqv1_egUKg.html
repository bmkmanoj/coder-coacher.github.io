up being way more code than you expect
to get an idea of why let's try breaking
down a classic game into its components
and its behaviors if you haven't played
Tetris go play it like right now it's an
essential part of gaming history if
you're just Google for tetris you'll
find a dozen versions you can play
online for free let's do an
object-oriented analysis of Tetris what
we're going to do is write down a
paragraph describing exactly how Tetris
works then we're going to underline all
of the nouns to get an idea of what
classes we might need to implement
Tetris then will underline all the verbs
to get an idea what methods those
classes might need so what is tetris
tetris is a game where colored tetra me
knows that's the technical term fall
down a field of play until they collide
with the previously placed tetra me know
as a tetra me know is falling the user
can rotate it and can drop it into place
once a tetra me know comes to rest if a
line of blocks in the field of play is
complete it is removed and all blocks
placed above it or move down removing a
line earns points points are displayed
on a scoreboard along with a preview of
the next tetra me now now that's a super
cursory description but even here we
have a bunch of classes we would need in
order to implement the game we would
need a game class to set everything in
motion and coordinate the rest of the
actors we would need a class for the
falling tetra me know to represent its
position and its rotation and also what
shape it is we would need a field of
play to represent where all the blocks
are and to put the tetra me know
somewhere speaking of attributes of the
tetra me know we probably also want a
class to represent colors scanning
through some more for some more nouns we
find blocks alright so we might want a
class four blocks or perhaps blocks is
just part of the field of play I don't
know it's hard to say how to design it
best then we see we have points we need
a class to represent how many points we
have we'd also need a scoreboard to
display those points and we need this
whole preview pane thing now let's scan
through for some verbs to find what
methods these various classes would need
so the Tetra minos need to know how to
fall the Tetra minos also need to know
how to
rotate and how to drop some class needs
to know when a tetra me know collides
with blocks that are already in the
field of play maybe the tetra me know is
responsible for that maybe the field
play is responsible for that then
there's this concept of coming to rest
where a falling tetra me know just turns
into blocks in the field of play
scanning through some more we need a way
to remove lines of blocks from the field
of play we need a way to move down
blocks after line is removed then
there's the fact that all of this needs
to know how to draw itself and that's a
big task so again this is just a short
description of Tetris and an incredibly
simple analysis of it we could keep
going here point is games are
complicated and decomposing them into
their component parts is essential to
making any headway and actually
implementing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
