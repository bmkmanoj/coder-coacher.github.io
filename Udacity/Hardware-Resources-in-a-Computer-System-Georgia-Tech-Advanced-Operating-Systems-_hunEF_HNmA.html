cell phones and PDAs to laptops to
tablets to desktop computers all the way
to nodes in a data center that is
providing cloud computing services
regardless of these different
manifestations and sizes the
organization of the hardware inside the
computer system is pretty much the same
you've got a CPU and the CPU is
connected to a conduit which we call the
bus and you've got memory that has the
instructions and data that is needed for
the CPU to execute and the CPU can use
this conduit namely the bus to access
the memory and you need storage for
persistence of files and other data that
you produce during the computation and
once again the CPU can access stuff on
the storage device through a controller
that is also connected to this conduit
and you may have other peripheral
devices like a microphone or a camera
all of these devices of course are
accessible for the CPU through this
conduit which is the bus and of course
in this day and age a device has to be
able to communicate with the outside
world you have a network and once again
the network is interfaced through a
controller to the CPU via this conduit
so this conduit for communication which
is the bus serves the purpose of
connecting the CPU to the memory as well
as all the i/o devices that it may need
to interact with in order to do whatever
the intent is of the user and the
application that they want to run on the
computer and depending on the
sophistication of the device that we are
talking about and the speed of the
device that we're talking about these
controllers that I'm showing you may
have different capabilities so for
instance an network controller may have
the ability to move the data directly
from the memory
into the network or from the network
into the memory and this as you may have
learned in a computer organization
course is called direct memory access
for the controller to move data swiftly
between memory and the i/o device and
similar DMA facility may exist in the
controller's of other high-speed devices
disk is another high-speed device so
that's the capability that you've got
for some of these controllers some of
these controllers may be slow enough for
instance a keyboard or a mouse that the
CPU can directly query new data that is
coming from the controller that is
associated with slow speed devices and
move it into memory or use it in any
fashion that it wants</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
