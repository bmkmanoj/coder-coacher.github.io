in practice by using an example we're
going to consider a program that takes
as input a text file and produces it as
output a filtered file so basically it
outputs a subset of the content of this
text file based on some filter and we're
gonna have a four different types of
filters so the first one is no filtering
which means that the whole content of
the text file will be produced on the
output the second filter will output
only words that start with T so you will
take the text file and simply ignore all
of the words they do not start with T so
in the output we will have only those
words that start with the letter T the
third filter will produce in the output
only words that are longer than five
characters so all the other words will
be simply disregarded and finally the
fourth filter will produce as output
only words in the text file that are
palindromes and in case you don't know
what the palindrome is a palindrome is a
word that is the same whether you read
it from left to right or from right to
left for example the word kayak you can
read it in this direction or in this
direction it's exactly the same word so
now let's see how this program could be
implemented using a strategy pattern and
let's do it for real as a demo mobile
looking at here is the editor page for
eclipse open with the strategy pattern
implementation for our example so what
I'm gonna do is then I'm gonna look at
the different parts of the
implementation and you will see that you
know despite the fact that is slightly
long it's really fairly simple it's
gonna be a straightforward
implementation of what we just saw as I
just said what we're doing is basically
building the strategy pattern that
allows for changing the strategies with
which we're filtering an input file and
we have different strategies we'll look
at those in detail and we said that the
three participants for this pattern are
the context the algorithm which is the
general interface and then the concrete
strategies which are the concrete
implementations of this algorithm so
let's start by looking at the context
which is this class here and as you can
see it contains a reference at the
current strategy we call this a check
strategies which is a basically our
filter and when the context is created
by default it sets the strategy to the
old strategies the old strategy is the
one that accepts all the input so
basically it doesn't filter out anything
and we said that the context is the
interface to the outside world right so
it has to provide that the outside world
with a way of selecting the strategy the
specific
algorithm to be used and it does that in
this case by providing this change
strategy method this method takes a
strategy as input and simply replaces
the current strategy with the one
specified as a parameter and at this
point the contest also will perform the
filtering the filtering is pretty
straightforward so what it does is that
it opens a file that is passed as a
parameter so that this is the file the
input file to be filtered and then it
reads the file line-by-line and then
split the lines into its composing words
and then for each world in each line
what it will do it will basically invoke
the check method in the current strategy
which is basically the filtering method
and if the check method returns a true
which basically means that the world
should be printed it prints the word
otherwise it'll just skip it so
basically the field that will return
false for all the worlds they have to be
filtered out okay this is the basic way
in which the context works let's see how
this is used in our main method the main
method simply create the context really
in profile from the arguments and then
what it does is simply as a
demonstration it would perform the
filtering using all the different
filters so starting from the default one
which is the one that basically doesn't
do any filtering that reports all words
then it was reached to the algorithm
that only considers the words that start
with T and it will do that by invoking a
change strategy and passing this
strategy as the argument and then
performing the actual filtering through
context and he will do exactly the same
for the strategy that only prints words
that are longer than five and the one
that only prints words that are part in
terms so now let's look at the actual
algorithm this is the interface the
algorithm interface and you can see that
the only thing that the interface
provides is this method which is the
check method that takes a string as
input and we return a boolean so
basically is the boolean that we were
saying before the one that is true for
the words that have to be printed and
false for the ones that have to be
filtered out now we have all the
different implementations of the
algorithm the simplest one is the whole
algorithm that simply returns always
true so all the words will be printed
the second one is the start with T and
again without looking at the details of
the implementations that don't really
matter what it does is basically
checking that the first character is T
and returns true in that case and false
otherwise similarly for the longer than
five algorithm also in this case this
will implement the check strategy
interface and the check will be
performed by checking that the word is
longer than five characters and
returning true in that case and
otherwise and finally the palindrome
check is a little more complicated but
basically it just checks whether the
word is a palindrome and returns true in
that case okay so as I said it doesn't
really matter too much what is the
specific implementation of these matters
what matters is that we have a general
interface for the algorithm and then n
different concrete implementations of
the algorithm that implement different
strategies so again this allows you to
change the behavior of your class
without changing class so we have this
context class that does different things
when the filter method is invoked
depending on what is the current
strategy so the behavior of the class
can change dynamically and it changes
dynamically every time that we change
the strategy at this point the way this
whole thing works should be clear so
what we're going to do is that we're
going to go to our console and we're
actually gonna run the strategy pattern
and see what happens so here I have a
file it's called food txt and if we look
at the content of foo you can see that
it says that this is just a test to
assess how well this program performs
when used on files of text and since it
checks for palindromes we will also
insert one such word level level is a
palindrome because you can read it from
both sides okay so let's see what
happens when we run our code so we're
gonna run Java pattern strategy dot
strategy pattern which is our class and
we're gonna pass food dot txt as an
input and let's go back to the beginning
of the output to see what happened
exactly you can see here that for the
default strategy which was the old
strategy the whole file is printed so
every word is printed this is just a
test to assess and so on and so forth ok
as expected for the filter that only
prints words the start with T only words
that start with T are printed again as
expected
similarly for the filter that only
prints words that are longer than 5 and
finally for the one that prints
palindromes and here you can see that we
actually have two because the way in
which this is implemented will also
consider single letter words as poly
introns because you can read them from
both sides but you definitely will have
also level in the output and in case you
want to play with this code yourself I
have made that this code and also the
implementation for examples of other
design patterns available as a
compressed archive and the archive is
accessible through a URL that is
provided in the notes for the class</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
