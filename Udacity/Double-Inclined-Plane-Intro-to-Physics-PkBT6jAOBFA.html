inclined plane and what we have here is
pretty intimidating looking setup we
have what we could view as well
two inclined planes wanting claimed an
angle alpha and one inclined at an angle
beta we have two masses and one and M
two and of course we're pretending like
there's no friction because we just
don't want to deal with that right now I
want to know if I set the system up and
then release it
how is it going to accelerate just to be
consistent let's call a clockwise
direction so if this one's moving up and
this one's moving down the plane will
call that a positive acceleration plus a
and for this question I'm going to tell
you that the acceleration looks
something like this
now what's going on here well the
acceleration is G the acceleration due
to gravity times this modifier of some
sort and what I want you to do is in
each of the red boxes but either a one
or two if the relevant mass is mass one
you put a one - you put it - and in the
blue box says I want you to put either a
plus a minus multiplication sign or
division sign depending on what you
think makes sense now you could just
solve this equation you could do F
equals MA for both of the blocks and get
an answer or you could try using your
intuition see what makes sense think of
limiting cases what happens when m1 gets
really big or m2 gets really big what
happens if beta is really small or alpha
is really small thinking this way should
be able in theory to tell you exactly
what symbols go in the blue and red
boxes good luck</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
