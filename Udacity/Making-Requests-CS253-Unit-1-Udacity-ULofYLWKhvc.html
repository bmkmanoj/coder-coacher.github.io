looks something like this it is followed
by a number of headers headers have this
format name colon space value let's add
some headers when you make a request all
of this is sent at once the request line
followed by a number of headers these
aren't the only headers that are sent
but these are some of the more popular
ones the first one is called host and
this is from the URL this is the host
part of the URL it's required an HTTP
1.1 it's not strictly required on 1.0
but why is this useful we've already
connecting to the machine so why do we
need to say what the host is again it
would be like if you came out to me and
said Steve what is your name obviously
already know my name so why are you
asking well it's because web servers may
have multiple names 11 machine one web
server can host the website for many
websites for example with Udacity com
which is hosted on google's app engine
each of those machines hosts many
websites so we need to say which website
we're requesting the document for the
next header this one is called user
agent this describes basically what who
is making the request this is generally
your browser your browser put its name
in there and there's also some some
version info and things like that and
this is really helpful for the service
so they know what type of machine is
making the request</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
