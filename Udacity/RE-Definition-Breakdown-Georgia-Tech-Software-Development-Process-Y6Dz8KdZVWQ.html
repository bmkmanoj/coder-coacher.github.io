identify the purpose of the system and
collect good requirements to answer that
question let me give you another
definition of requirements engineering
and this one is a classical one one that
summarizes what we discussed so far and
then we can use as some sort of
reference and it is a little long
definitely longer than the one that we
saw at the beginning but it's an
important one and contains a lot of very
relevant points so we're going to go
through it and highlight these points so
the definition says that requirements
engineering is a set of activities
concerned with identifying and
communicating the purpose of a software
intensive system and the context in
which it will be used and this is
exactly what we said at the beginning
but something that we can highlight in
here is the fact that we're talking
about a set of activities so what that
means is that requirements engineering
is not just a phase or a stage it also
says that it's about identifying and
communicating and what that is telling
us is that communication is as important
as the analysis so it's important to be
able to communicate these requirements
not only to collect them and we will
discuss many reasons why that is the
case it explicitly talks about purpose
so that allows me to stress once more
that quality means fitness for purpose
we cannot say anything about quality
unless we understand the purpose and the
last thing I want to point out in this
first part of the definition is the use
of the term context this is also
something else that we mentioned in the
beginning that designers analysts need
to know how and where the system will be
used without this information you cannot
really understand what the system should
do and you can really build the system
so now let's continue and read the
second part of the definition that says
that hence requirements engineering acts
as the bridge between the real world
needs of users customers and other
constituencies affected by a software
system and the capabilities and
opportunities afforded by software
intensive technologies this is a long
sentence but also here we can point out
a few interesting and relevant points
let me start by highlighting two parts
real world needs and capabilities and
opportunities so what are these two
parts telling us they are telling us
that the requirements are partly about
what is needed the real world needs of
all these stakeholders but they're also
partly about what is possible
what we can actually build we need to
compromise between these two things and
finally I would like to point out this
term constituencies which indicates that
we need to identify all of the
stakeholders not just the customer and
the user so anybody who is affected by a
software system it is very important to
consider all of these actors otherwise
again we'll be missing requirements
we'll be missing part of the purpose of
the system and we will build a
suboptimal system</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
