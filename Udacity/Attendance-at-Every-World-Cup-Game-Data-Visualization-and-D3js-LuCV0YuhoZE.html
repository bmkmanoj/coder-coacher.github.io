I'm simply going to close the web
console and see what gets displayed in
my chart and as you can see here we've
drawn one blue circle for every game of
the World Cup throughout the years now
there's a few styling issues that Mia
clean up simply with some CSS mainly the
width of the axis lines the years on the
x-axis and something you may not be able
to notice here that there's a lot of
overlap in the circles so by adding some
opacity to the circles we can see
similar to what we saw in the facebook
IPO example some overlap to know the
density of points so again using CSS to
style my axes and my SVG circles and my
text the chart looks much nicer and much
crisper I don't want to spend the time
to go through every one of the CSS
changes I've made but if you're
interested and if you're comfortable
enough with CSS I encourage you to look
back at the files and use the CSS
resources we are provided to understand
better what's going on so after all of
these updates that we've made in d3 we
finally have a equivalent chart that we
made in dimple jas with its short five
lines but again by converting our
previous chart to d3 it's going to allow
us much more flexibility to add both
interaction and to customize the look
and feel of the chart and when all is
said and done took only approximately 40
or more lines of d3 to recreate what
we've done in dimple in five but if
you're going to be a stickler about it
each of these statements here
technically is one line one long chain
of functions but for clarity's sake I've
written every new function call on a new
line</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
