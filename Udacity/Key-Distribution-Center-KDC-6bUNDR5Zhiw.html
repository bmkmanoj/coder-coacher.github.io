key exchange based on a sphere secret is
that it cannot scale that is suppose we
use the share master keys as a way to
expand exchange the new session key this
scheme does not scale easily that is
Alice needs to share a master key with
Bob and then another master key with
Carol and so on and so forth using a key
distribution center or KDC can solve
this scalability problem each party has
his or her own master key shared with
the KDC that is the KDC has many master
keys one for each party but each party
only keeps one master key that is shared
with the KDC so for example Alice has ka
that is shared with KDC and Bob has KB
that is shared with KD see now suppose
Alice and Bob wants to have a secure
session
therefore the nearest session key K s
first Alice sends a request to KD c
saying that i need a key to talk to Bob
along with an ounce and one announce is
a random value then the KDC sent a
message back to Alice that is encrypted
using the master key ka that is shared
between Alice and KD see this message
contains the session key K s that the
KDC has created for Alice and Bob to
share the message also contains the same
request that Alice sent to KD c along
with the same nonce value and one and a
message we call ticket the ticket is
encrypted using the master key KB that
is shared between Bob and KD c and it
contains the session key K s and ID of
Alice when Alice gets back the message
from the KDC she can decrypt it because
she has the master key ka and so she can
extract the session key K s and she
knows that the message is from the KDC
and is fresh that is it is
not a replay because only the KDC can
use ka to encrypt properly a message
that contains the original request and
announce that she just sent Alice then
sends the ticket to Bob note that only
Bob can decrypt them ticket because it
is encrypted using KB the master key
shared between Bob and the KDC in fact
when Bob decrypts the ticket he knows
that the ticket is created by the KDC
because only the KDC can encrypt the ID
of Alice properly and he knows that the
session key K s was created by K DC and
his for communication with Alice then
Bob sends a message that contains an
ounce n2 which is a random value and his
ID encrypted using a session key K s to
Alice when Alice receives this message
she knows that she is communicating with
Bob because only he can decrypt a ticket
and get a session key K s and encrypt ID
properly Alice then performs an
agreed-upon transformation on n to say
at 102 n 2 and encrypt the result using
K s and sends it back to Bob this proves
to Bob that he is communicating with
Alice
because only she has a session key K s</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
