block of data of any size a hash
function produces an output of fixed
size typically in the range of 128 bits
to 512 bits it should be very efficient
to compute a hash of an input for given
hash value it should be computationally
infeasible to find the input so that the
hash matches the given hash value that
is a hash function should be a one-way
function given input data say m1 it
should be computationally infeasible to
find another input value say m2 that is
not equal to m1 such that they had the
same hash value this is the wig
collision resistant property the strong
collision new system property is such
that it should be conditionally
infeasible to find different inputs and
1 not equal to m 2 such that they had
the same hash value the first three
properties make hash functions practical
for security applications in particular
you can handle data of any size and it's
very efficient to compute the hash the
one-way property says that it is quite
easy to compute a hash value given a
message but it is virtually impossible
to find original input message given a
hash value this property is very
important for message authentication for
example we can authenticate a message by
hashing a secret value together with a
message the secret is not sent the hash
and the message is sent if the hash
function is not one way then the
attacker being able to intercept the
hash value that's being transmitted he
can then find an input that confused the
hash value and the input would include
the secret value that is the attacker
will be able to obtain the secret value
therefore this one-way poverty is
extremely important the week collision
resistant poverty says that forgiven
message it is not possible to find a
different message such that it will have
the same hash value as the given message
this is a very important property to
ensure message integrity now
take a closer look at this wig collision
resistant property suppose when the
sender sends a message to receiver he
wants to ensure the integrity of the
message so the sender sends a message
along would have included hash code of
the message now an attacker can
intercept the message and the encrypted
hash code that's being transmitted given
a message the attacker can also compute
the hash code of course this hash code
is not encrypted because the attacker
does not have the key then if the week
collision resistant property is not true
the attacker will be able to fight
another message such that each hash
value is the same as the hash value of
the original message then the attacker
simply forwards to the receiver the
forge message along with the original
included hashcode the receiver will not
be able to tell that the message has
been modified by the attacker because
the forge message has exactly the same
hash value as the original message the
strong collision resistant property says
that it is not possible to find any pair
of two different messages so that they
have the same hash value it should be
obvious that the strong collision
resistant property implies the rig
collision resistant property the week
collision resistant property means that
the hash function is collision resistant
only to the specific given input
messages well as the strong collision
resistant property means that the hash
function is collision resistant to any
pair of different messages therefore
this is stronger poverty and it implies
the weaker property the strong collision
resistant property provides strong
message authenticity and integrity
protection let's take a look at an
example suppose Bob did some work for
Alice and he wants Alice to pay him
later so he can draft a iou message and
ask alice to sign and then agreed to pay
for it to sign the message Alice were
hash the iou message and then signed the
hash using her private key this would
prove that Alice authorized the iou
message in other words Alice will agree
to pay this amount later in a later day
buck can present this IOU message on
with the signature to Alice or Alice's
bank to get the money now suppose the
strong collision resistant property is
not true that would mean that Bob can
find two different messages one with a
smaller dollar amount for example this
small amount can be just once
installment of Alice's payment to Bob
and the large amount would be several
times the amount of money that Alice
olds Bob and if these two messages have
the same hash value then Park can
present a message with a small amount to
Alice and have Alice sign it then later
day Bob can present a signature with a
different message that is the message
with the large amount and ask alice to
pay for it and because these two
different messages had the same hash
value Alice cannot deny that she has
signed it that means Alice cannot deny
that she had agreed to pay this large
amount</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
