the page table entries at least the
entries at the leaves of the hierarchy
in our example where we had a 32-bit
physical address space it would be
typical to have a page table entries
also of 32-bit with four K pages only 20
bits would be needed for the physical
page frame what do we do with the other
12 bits well it turns out that there's
lots of other information worth storing
in the page table some of the more
important are things like access control
do we have read write or execute
permissions on this memory if we don't
then when we come to this page entry an
access violation or segmentation fault
will occur another essential piece of
information is whether the information
associated with the virtual address is
actually in memory at the moment it may
be the data that we need was not loaded
on the application startup or it may
have been swapped out to disk in either
of those cases the valid or the present
bit would be 0 when a process tries to
access the page for the valid bit is 0
it creates a page fault and lets the OS
try to bring the needed data into memory
we'll look at the page fault handler
next one of these bits also indicates
whether the page is dirty that is has it
been written to since it was loaded for
disk if not then if it becomes necessary
to evict this page from memory there is
no need to write it to disk if it's
already are there a nice optimization
sometimes a bit or two will also control
how caching of this page is done page
table entries corresponding to virtual
addresses that were never mapped to a
physical address by the OS usually have
physical frame numbers of 0 a physical
frame number of 0 is rather like a null
pointer everybody knows that that's an
invalid physical frame number and a
second fault will be generated</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
