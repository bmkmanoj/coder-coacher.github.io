highest is called the mode and this
certainly works in describing the
distribution in the case of a histogram
the mode would be this bin right here
and this bin right here the most common
value is the mode and in this case we
can't see individual values but we can
see that most of the values rests within
this spin so the mode occurs here and
here the value in the middle of the
distribution is called the median and
this would also work we'll go more into
depth later
and finally the average is a statistic
that rests at a specific spot in the
middle of the distribution we're going
to elaborate on this in this lesson the
value where the frequency is the lowest
in this case it's right here and it
looks to be about 72 or 75 and this most
definitely would not represent the whole
distribution where there are a lot of
scores here more towards 50 and the
biggest value on the x axis again that's
here at about 75 here probably the
biggest value is somewhere around 90 and
that doesn't represent the whole
distribution so let's ignore these two
but we know that the mode median and
average can all help describe the
distributions they each have strengths
and weaknesses and we'll explore all of
these throughout this lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
