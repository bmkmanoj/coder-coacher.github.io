to take this structure here make it a
bit smaller like this and take away the
NP here and we are going to reappear in
a minute and what I'm now going to do is
I'm going to put a bunch of these
structures together so connect these by
an edge connect these pilot and we're
also going to do one here and i'll call
this one a and this one be now what you
see here is that I have taken three
structures like this and put them
between a and B I'm going to do this
more generally now so imagine that
instead of an edge here I could have
more of these structures I'll just write
three dots here and this will represent
additional copies of this structure
being in between here so in total I will
have n copies of the structure so n
times this structure here appears
between a and B and now my question is
how many shortest path between a and B
can you have that visit all of the
vertices here if you have n copies of
that structure is that N squared is that
two to the power of n or is that too n</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
