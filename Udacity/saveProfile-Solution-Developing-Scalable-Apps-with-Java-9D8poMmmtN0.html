rid of some of the variables that we
don't really need anymore so the first
thing we do is if the user is now with
an unauthorized exception the next thing
to do is to get the main email as the
user's email and get the user ID then we
get the display name sent by the request
and the t-shirt size sent by the request
then this is new we load the profile
might not be there but we go ahead and
load it anyway then we need to check
that it actually existed so check of its
now then if it is now that means it
didn't already exist we need to set the
display name either to the value passed
in the profile form or otherwise if the
display name wasn't passed get the
default name and again similarly with
the t-shirt get the value passed by the
form and if it's now set it to a default
which is not specified this case not
specified and then we need to actually
create the profile so this was our call
is our call to create the new profile
however the profile already exists just
call update method passing the display
name and the t-shirt size which remember
one or either of these could in fact be
now and then we save it in the data
store as we did before here the coast
has been made more concise and we return
the profile now let's take a look at
profile Java to look at the update
method which is pretty simple takes the
display name and the t-shirt size checks
each one of their now if they are now
doesn't do anything with that property
they're not now that means the user
updated that value so update the
appropriate property that's all it does
this doesn't do the saving because
remember we do the saving back here in
save profile all right let's see if it
actually works so I deployed to
localhost and came over to the our old
friend the api's Explorer we have some
profile so let's see what they are so
get the existing profile and you see
that the name is Apple turnover and the
t-shirt size is XL
yes so remember that Apple turnover
access now let's save the profile and
we're just going to update one of the
properties let's change the display name
to ice cream cake so we'll save that and
the exist remember that the existing
t-shirt sizes XS so let's see what
happens ok good so the display name was
set to ice cream name but the t-shirt
size was size was left as access so now
we know that we didn't get a new profile
we just updated the existing profile</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
