pseudo Facebook user data set we've come
to learn a lot about our users from
their birthdays to their friend counts
their friendships initiated we've really
come to understand their behaviors and
how they use the facebook platform but
now I think it's time for something
completely different and the next couple
of segments we'll look at another data
set and then we'll return to this
Facebook data set to draw some
comparisons here's Dean to introduce
this new data set and why we might look
at it in the first place because of
online purchases credit cards and
loyalty cards lots of retail purchase
data is associated with individuals or
households such that there is a history
of purchase data over time analysts and
industry often mind this panel scanner
data and economists and other behavioral
scientists use it to test and develop
theories about consumer behavior we are
going to work with a data set describing
household purchases of five flavors of
dannon yogurt in the eight ounce size
their price is recorded with each
purchase occasion this yogurt data set
has a quite different structure than our
pseudo Facebook data set the synthetic
Facebook data has one row per individual
with that row giving their
characteristics and counts of behaviors
over a single period of time on the
other hand the yogurt data has many rows
per household one for each purchase
occasion this kind of micro data is
often useful for answering different
types of questions than we've looked at
so far</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
