the strategy pattern which provides a
way to configure a class with one of
many behaviors what does that mean what
more precisely this patterns allows for
defining a family of algorithms
encapsulating them in separate classes
so each algorithm in one class and
making these classes interchangeable by
providing a common interface for all the
encapsulated algorithm so in essence the
intent of a strategy pattern is to allow
for switching between different
algorithms for accomplishing a given
task for example imagine having
different sorting algorithms with
different space or time trade-offs you
might want to be able to have them all
available and to use different ones in
different situations and this pattern is
applicable not only when we have
different variants of an algorithm but
also when we have many related classes
that differ only in their behavior so
let's get more concrete and see how this
is done and I'm going to do it as before
by discussing the structure and the
participant for the strategy pattern in
this case we had three types of
participants for this pattern in the
context the algorithm and the concrete
strategies they can be as many as the
number of behaviors that I need to
implement so let's see what those are
the context is the interface to the
outside world it maintains a reference
to the current algorithm and allows for
updating this reference at runtime so
basically the outside world will invoke
the functionality provided by the
different algorithms by using this
interface and depending on which
algorithm is currently selected that's
the one that will be executed when the
functionality is invoked the algorithm
also called the strategy so that's where
the pattern gets its name is the common
interface for the different algorithms
so all the algorithms implement this
interface finally the concrete
strategies are the actual
implementations of the algorithms so if
I have a ten different variants of my
algorithm I will implement ten different
concrete strategies there will all be
implementations of this interface</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
