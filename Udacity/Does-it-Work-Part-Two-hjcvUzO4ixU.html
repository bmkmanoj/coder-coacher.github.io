before that the learning rule is really
simple for those so that's great people
like satinder singh and ron par have
gotten cool things to happen for things
like cell phone channel allocation and
so that's pretty cool you have to be
really really careful about what
features you use right because actually
I probably should have mentioned this
before the important thing about the
features I'm going to say that it's
important that we find features that are
both computationally efficient and value
informative and what I mean by that is
computationally efficient what would be
an example of a feature that we really
really great but is not particularly
computationally efficient the one that
tells us what the proper action is I
don't know or what the value is actually
mr. yeah exactly so so if some if there
was a feature that actually encoded the
value function that would be great that
would be really good for learning the
thing is we don't know how to get that
feature efficiently if we did we
wouldn't have to learn it all right so
we have to somehow get features that we
can extract efficiently from the state
but again that's really easy to do we
can just return the state as a feature
it's really important that it actually
also be value informative right so that
that one feature actually gives you lots
of information about what the predicted
value ought to be so somehow balancing
these two things is often very tricky to
get to work right so going back to our
taxi example if it turns out that
knowing how far away the taxi is from
someplace or how far away of passenger
is from someplace and you can compute
that pretty easily then you should do it
because it's helpful type in your
learning I written those had to figure
it out and so that would be a good thing
right yeah so distance to passenger
could be something that's both
computationally efficient because you
can just kind of pull it right out of
the state representation and probably
value informative because it's actually
very relevant to know are we close to
being able to pick up the passenger or
is it is the passenger quite distant and
difficult to reach so yeah I think
that's that's probably the kind of
things that we would want we probably
should try that before we tell people
that we think that's a great idea but
but in general these are the kind of
properties that you're trying to balance
and I want to mention because this is
very hot right now another example of
using neural networks to learn value
functions has been carried out recently
by google deepmind and they were using
deep neural networks you know what deep
neural networks are you know the
their networks that are very profound
yes their poetic neural networks mm-hmm
no they are neural networks that are
neural networks except some of them have
you know we're instead of say three
layers they can have 10 15 that can
actually be quite substantially more
sophisticated and complicated and they
often involve using things like
convolutions to work well on the unwell
kinds of inputs so what min at all did
at google deepmind is they actually
learned effective strategies for atari
video games mapping the the screen the
pixels on the screen to Joystiq actions
which is really neat mmm right I mean so
it's actually learning to play the game
given very similar kind of input to what
people get and and in fact they were
able to get it to learn very effectively
to the point where that you could argue
that it was comparable to people on
average at least on some games but did
it learn how to play thermonuclear war
no it learned that the winning move is
not to play oh nice no that's not true
that was a war games reference and in
fact it did not learn not to play it was
not given the option to learn not to
play it just had to play whatever was
given grad school and we're back no it
is true that out some of the games it
was super human and in other the games
it was way way subhuman and that was why
I said you could argue on average that
it was about human level hmm okay but
that's like arguing that on average you
know if I have my head in an oven and my
feet in ice water on average I'm
comfortable yes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
