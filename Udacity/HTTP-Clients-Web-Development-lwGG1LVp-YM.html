kind of standard picture of this little
guy and his browser now this used to be
you but now this is the user you have
upgraded to the other side of the
picture where the servers are so let's
get these boxes we've seen these a
hundred times okay and let's let's add
you over here you are now the programmer
congratulations you are a web developer
and we can talk about users and how much
trouble they cause us now a normal web
request a user makes a request to the
servers and we respond with with with
the response so no surprises there now
what we're gonna be talking about today
is when your servers start making
requests to other servers so you know
this is our website you know it runs on
these boxes let's say we're gonna hit
you know somebody else
Twitter for example and they have their
own servers and these servers are
probably on fire because it's a Twitter
and so we can have a we can have a web
page that actually makes requests to
Twitter and these are our computers
talking to their computers and this
happens all the time they're still
communicating over HTTP and Twitter
still responds as usual
but if we're writing some-some you know
what program that for example you know
does some data analysis on Twitter a
user might make a request to us we might
make a request to Twitter servers they
respond with you know with their
responses as they would normally and
then we may manipulate that data and
return it to the user and this is
actually a really common case and what
I'd like to do now is actually explain
how Hipmunk works a little bit because
we do a lot of this type of
communication okay so let's change our
picture a little bit to be a little bit
more about Hipmunk
because I'd like to explain how our
architecture works so in this case this
is still we call users customers when
they're actually paying and this is me
Steve and this is Hipmunk servers now
when a user does a flight search what we
do is we hit a bunch of our data
providers to actually where we actually
get our flight data from so the first
thing we'll do is we'll take your flight
search and we'll we'll send it to ITA
we'll send it to an airline and in some
cases we'll even send it to Amtrak if if
that's appropriate each of these guys
are their own you know these these are
companies who have their own services
that we work with and so ITA will run
our flight search and they'll send us
data back
the airline or two well they'll run
their own flight search on their own
system and they'll send it back to us
an Amtrak will do its thing and send
their data back to us so then on our
server we have all of this all this
flight search data represented by this
blob here we will manipulate all this
data collate it make you nice results
and then we'll send back our HTML
response so what we're going to be
working on in this unit is how do we
make our server speak to other servers
when there's no browser involved we're
still using HTTP but we are now
communicating over other protocols and
we saw some of this in unit 1 but we're
gonna be doing a lot of it in this
lesson because there's a lot of cool
things you can do when you realize that
you're not the only service on the
Internet</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
