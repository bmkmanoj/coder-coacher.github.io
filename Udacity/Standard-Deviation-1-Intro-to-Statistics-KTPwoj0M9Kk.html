variances again and let me give you
another word that's very important
called standard deviation the variance
by its very nature computes the Knik
quadratic
it's the quadratic deviation from the
mean in fact is the average quadratic
deviation from the mean if we don't want
something quadratic then you can take
the square root of it and it gets what's
called the standard deviation so in the
first case the square root of zero point
eight is zero point eight nine forty
four and in the second case this square
root of 100 48.4 is about twelve point
one eight this is how much you expect
the age of an individual family member
to deviate from the mean by about twelve
years whereas here you expect the
deviation to be just below one year and
you can see why this is a good
approximation here four of the five kids
differ in age of one year whereas here
people differ as much as twenty years an
age from the mean so the variance and
the standard deviation are much larger
so let's practice this give you a couple
of quizzes now and give you data I want
you to complete the mean for me the
variance and the standard deviation
three four five six seven please fill in
all three of those values</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
