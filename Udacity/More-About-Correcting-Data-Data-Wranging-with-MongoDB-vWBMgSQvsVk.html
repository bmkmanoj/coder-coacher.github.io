little bit more about correcting data
the types of Corrections that we
typically make 20 data set that we're
cleaning usually involve one or more of
the following we're going to be removing
typographical errors or correcting them
there will often be a component in
cleaning where we're validating against
unknown list of entities we will
frequently be cross checking our data
with a validated data set of some kind
we might be doing data enhancement and
frequently are where we are making data
a little more complete by adding some
related information so for example we
might have a username an email address
and first and last name for every entry
in a recordset and as part of our
cleaning process or part of our process
before we analyze data we're going to
integrate each of those records with
marketing data for each person on
employer and job title etc another
common thing we do in cleaning data is
harmonizing the data so for example in
this case we would be transforming all
abbreviations for street and road to say
for example their full names or vice
versa maybe we're going the other
direction likewise with directions and
NW become north and west etc in
addresses we might also be changing our
data set so that it uses a new standard
for some set of codes that it contains
so for example we might be transforming
our data set to instead of two digit
country codes use three digit codes by
simply mapping each of the two digit
codes on to the appropriate three digit
code these are some of the common types
of tasks that we do when cleaning data
and again it's very situation specific
so what we've tried to do throughout
this lesson and what we're going to do
in the problem set is give you examples
from a few different situations to give
you some practice with cleaning so that
you have some concrete examples in mind
when you get into your own data
wrangling tasks where you need to do
some data cleaning</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
