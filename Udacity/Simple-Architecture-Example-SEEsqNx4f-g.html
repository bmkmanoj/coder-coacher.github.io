client-server system at the outermost
level is the keyword system indicating
that what's being provided here is a
configuration describing this particular
architecture the system has a name in
this case simple CS and then contained
within it are some other statements
describing the constituents of that
particular system in this case there are
two components one is called client and
one is called server and there's one
connector also there are two attachments
for plugging them together the first
component client has one port out of
which requests are sent the second
component server has one port for
receiving requests the connector which
is called RPC has two roles one of which
is called the caller role in one of
which is called the Kali role then in a
natural fashion to attach these together
the clients send requests port is
connected to the connectors caller role
and similarly the server's receive
requests port is connected to the
connectors collie role hence we've now
plugged together a client the server
using the connector in such a way that
the ports and roles are plugged into
each other the system is thus configured
in such a way that the client can send
requests using its port through the
connector so the server receives those
requests and can then act upon them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
