attractive and repulsive how does it
know when to behave in which way well
charge objects can either be positive or
negative this is totally different from
mass which when we describe numb takes
mass we said five kilograms we didn't
have to say plus five or minus five it
doesn't make sense to talk about
negative mass and the key thing to
remember with charge is that opposite
charges attract each other but like
charges repel now this is really amazing
now the key thing with charges is that
opposite charges attract and like
charges repel so let's say you have
these two charges and you are somehow
able to hold them in your fingers right
now there exists some force between
these two charges if I let go and allow
these charges to move I want to know
what will the charges look like after I
allow them to move what they look
exactly the same when nothing happened
where they come together and be really
close or would they fly apart from each
other
