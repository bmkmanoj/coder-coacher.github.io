procedure named replaced by it takes one
parameter as this input i'll call the
parameter P we could call it spy and
that might be a more natural name for it
here but to avoid confusion with the
variable spy we're using in the example
I'll call it P for the body of replaced
by what we want to do is change the
value in position two of the value
passed in so we can do that with an
assignment statement on the left side
we're selecting the cell and we're
replacing it with a value that we get
from the old value in that position plus
1 so this has the behavior that we want
and to have a better understanding why
let's see what happens when we pass a
value to procedure so here's what we had
before the call we've initialized the
variable spy to hold the list containing
three elements that are numbers 007 then
we make the call to replace by passing
in spy what happens when we call a
procedure the name of the variable in
the procedure now refers to the object
that's passed in so now the value of P
of the parameter here refers to that
object then we do the assignment we
replace the value in position two of P
with its previous value plus one so that
changes this value to eight the
parameter P and the variable s py both
refer to the same object so that also
changes the value of spy note that
there's no return statement here we
don't need to return a new value we've
modified the value of the list that was
passed in and I want to emphasize that
this is different from what's happened
in other procedures if you remember in
an earlier exercise you define the
procedure Inc it takes one input will
call it in and it adds one to that if we
remove the return statement from Inc it
doesn't change the value that's passed
in it does nothing and here's why so
suppose we had code like this will
introduce a variable a give it the value
3 will call ink on a
so what happens here well the variable a
that name refers to the value 3 when we
pass that to ink well the same thing
happens has happened when we passed the
mutable list as parameter P to replace
by the name n now refers to the same
value as a refer to but we can't mutate
that value what happens inside Inc is an
assignment statement we assigned to n
the value n plus 1 so that changes the
value n refers to now n refers to a
value for but that doesn't change the
value a refers to a still has the value
3 so we can see with numbers we can't
mutate the value of a number if we could
everywhere the value 3 existed before
well now what would mean for that would
be pretty confusing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
