implementing a parallel algorithm for
removing the red-eye defect that
commonly occurs in pictures of human
faces here is an example of the fact
that we are talking about you will be
implementing a simple algorithm for red
eye removal that factors nicely in
through three different parallel
operations the first operation is a
stencil computation over the image the
second is a sort and the third is map
you have been exposed to map and stencil
operations in the previous homework so
in this homework you will focus on
sorting when stars are red eye removal
algorithm by computing a score for each
pixel that estimates the likelihood of
that pixel belonging to red eye and
here's what the score looks like the
score is known as normalized
cross-correlation and it is expressed
naturally as a stencil patien we have
computed this normalized
cross-correlation score for you but if
you're interested when will provide
extra details about normalized
cross-correlation
in the instructor comments our next step
is to sort all the pixels in the image
according to their score note that the
pixels with the high scores are the
pixels that are most likely belong to a
red eye as you can see here the sorting
step is what you will be implementing in
problem set number four in case if you
are interested we will discuss several
different types of optimization
strategies for sorting in the instructor
comments our final step is to reduce the
redness of the high-scoring pixels this
computation is expressed naturally as a
map operation once again when performing
this step for you so you can concentrate
your efforts I'm sorting that is all
good luck and I hope you will enjoy
promise and number four and like the
previous problem says I want to thank
Eric and Mike for writing the code and
the script
this prom set so thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
