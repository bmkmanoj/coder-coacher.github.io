the second part of this activity than
you did on the first unless of course
you speak polish these letters are just
the numbers 1 through 10 written in
polish now this may seem obvious you
didn't speak Polish so you didn't
understand the first sentence but what
actually happened when you saw this
second group of characters well your
mind immediately recognize these three
letters because you're an expert in the
English language you are able to
identify these characters as a group a
word for the more you probably
identified these as a second word and
then you've activated a second schema
used English to identify the words and
then your knowledge of numbers to
identify another pattern these are just
the numbers 1 through 12 so I bet in 15
seconds you could memorize all these
characters which is really an amazing
thing think of what your approach was to
memorizing these numbers it probably
wasn't as ordered you probably didn't
see the patterns that were there and it
probably felt like a pretty stressful
task that's what our students feel like
when we ask them to perform tasks for
which they don't have the appropriate
schemas the best learning happens when
we design learning experiences which
build these experts schemas and our
students in this lesson and in the next
you'll learn how to do exactly that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
