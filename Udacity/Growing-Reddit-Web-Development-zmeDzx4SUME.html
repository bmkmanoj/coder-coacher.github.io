kind of the architecture decisions we
made on reddit and how we kind of grew
the site and store data differently over
time what I'd like to talk about is how
we actually grew the site from a social
point of view you know how we got users
and how we kind of maintain the feel
that reddit has it's hard for me or
anybody to really take credit for
growing reddit because it's a social
thing and it's even if Alexis and I
started over today knowing everything we
know now would be very hard to get a
site like Reddit off the ground social
web sites require a little bit of magic
to work and we were fortunate enough to
have it but we did a lot of very
important things that I think helped one
of which was in the beginning Alexis and
I submitted all of the content if you go
to reddit submission page now it
basically boils down to two fields and
in the early days it was just two fields
she basically had a field called URL
which was the URL of the site you were
submitting and title which was the title
of that site and that would be the link
you submitted the red if Alexis and I
went to the page we had a third field
called user and we could type in a name
here and then when we hit submit we
would automatically register this user
if that name didn't exist and submit the
content as that user so you'd go to
Reddit in the early days the first
couple of months and there'd be tons of
content it was I shouldn't say fake
content but it was fake users it was
really all just Alexis and I and that
did two things and I think this is
important to any site that where you
want to have a community feel the first
thing I did it was it set the tone web
sites have this kind of inertia and we
submitted content that we would be
interested in seeing and that meant the
content on Reddit at least for us and
for our kind of peer group it was good
the interesting stuff we wanted us a
site with the most interesting content
online and so we did our best to find it
and then we submitted that content
ourselves so when you show up to Reddit
you kind of know what sites all about
the other thing it did is it made the
site feel alive users like to feel a
part of something and if they showed up
to the website in the front page was
blank it looks like a ghost town you
don't wanna live in a ghost town you'd
rather live in New York City
most people would that's why New York
City is so big and ghost towns by
definition aren't that was really
fortunate and I don't know what made us
do this like in hindsight it's really
easy to say oh this is how it happened
but at the time I think we were just
embarrassed to have an empty web site so
we submitted the content and it worked
and I remember the first day a few
months in when we didn't have to submit
any content and that's that was such a
magical day for us because then we knew
the site was working on its own it was
really really cool took us a while to
get there and you know we really kind of
had the will the site into existence
another thing about the sites they
didn't have any comments to begin with I
don't know that this helped or hindered
us it was just you know we didn't get
around to writing it I think the only
thing I want to say here is that people
look at
and if you get into it you you quickly
realize that the comments are what makes
red at work that's where the really
incredible community lives and reddit
grew quite a bit before we even had a
comment system that came later it just
kind of goes to show how it's not always
obvious what the most important part of
a site is and it's better just to kind
of get something online and start
experimenting with it then to build a
whole system out and have it fail so we
didn't have any categorization what we
wanted users to do was submit links we
don't want them to have to think about
categories think about tags those are
all decisions and the more decisions you
have the harder it is to interact with
the site we had categorization on the
site I should say for about one day I
added it one night and Alexis took all
the links that have ever been submitted
to Reddit and then categorized them so
when users came the next morning
everything would be ready to go one of
our first investors and advisors was
like why did you add categorization that
ruined everything get rid of it so we
did and Alexis ended up he wasted all of
that time but that was really good
advice not having categorization meant
users could just show up in submit
content and kind of the serendipity of
the front page was really interesting
another thing we did is we didn't
collect emails every site on there had
the signup process where you'd have to
like into your email address and then
confirm an email all those steps you
have to do one of those steps involves
you're actually leaving your browser to
go to your email program or go to Gmail
or whatever just to become a member if
you want members and you want
submissions why do you why would you add
all these barriers like required email
addresses so we figured we're not going
to spam people like we don't have any
emails to send why do we need their
email addresses so we didn't collect
them that allowed users to register that
much fasting was a contributing factor
to our ability to grow another big thing
we did was no censorship we didn't care
what content was submitted to read it so
unless it was like overtly racist we
just let it be especially it feels
critical to us and that created this
kind of sense of community the sense of
trust and that's what ultimately I think
allowed reddit to grow to its tremendous
size as the users believed in us and
wanted to be a part of this community
and when we made mistakes even when I
goofed on the password hashing thing for
example they would kind of stick with us
because they realized our heart was in
the right place we just wanted to make a
site that was new and interesting you
know we didn't want to sell our users we
didn't want to ruin a site we just
wanted to have good content</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
