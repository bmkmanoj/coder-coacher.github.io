has come up with about whether it's
available whether it hasn't been
requested by somebody else and the one
that we had before concerning age
correspond to three conjuncts you know
three three possibilities that all must
hold and as we talked about a minute ago
we could have three separate
preconditions or we could have one
precondition with three with two and
separating three parts of it the other
thing to note in the expression of it is
we've used some new operation names in
expressing it so we said is available
now is available is not one that came
out of the process of building the UML
class diagram but that's okay it's like
breaking the writing of a method into
into pieces and calling other methods
along the way ok it's just divide and
conquer so we're going to assume we can
invent the names of these convenient
operations and that simplifies though
not only the writing here but the
reading as well if we're trying to show
the requirements to the customer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
