distributed systems today what you'll
see is there are applications and
applications that users use and there
are system services and there is a
microkernel sitting at the bottom and
these system services include things
like file server web server window
manager database manager and the network
stack for applications to do network
communication with servers that may be
on remote machines and the microkernel
itself may be responsible for process
management and managing the hardware
resources and providing inter process
communication both intra machine among
these services as well as inter machine
through the network stack remote
machines on the local area network we've
seen that this is a structure we like to
see in the operating system and in fact
from many of the previous lessons that
we have looked at in operating system
design and implementation both for a
single processor from multiprocessor and
a networked operating system this kind
of structure lends itself to
extensibility and yet high performance</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
