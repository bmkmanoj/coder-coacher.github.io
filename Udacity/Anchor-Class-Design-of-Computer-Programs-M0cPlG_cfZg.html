let's just deal with a single row at a
time so let's not worry about the rest
of the row let's not worry about going
in columns just deal with one row but
also have that row handle the cross
letters the crosswords so I'm going to
need a representation for a row and i
think i'm going to make that be a list
there many possible choices but a list
is good i choose a list rather than a
tuple because i want to be able to
change it in place I want to be able to
modify the row as we go as the game of
offs so Rose going to be a list of
squares if the square is a letter we'll
just use that letter as the value of the
square if the square is a empty spot
which has nothing in it I think I'll use
dot just to say nothing is there trick
that you learn once you've done this
kind of thing a lot of times is to say
well you know what I'm going to be
looking at letters I'm going to be
looking at locations in the row I can be
looking at their adjacent letters and
going to the right and going to the left
so if I'm try to fill in from this
anchor I'll move to the left to put in
the prefix and I'll move to the right to
extend the word and it seems to link to
me like I'm always going to have to
making checks of saying what's the next
character is it a letter is it an anchor
what is it and also whoops did I get
past the end of the board it seems like
i'm going to have to duplicate the
amount of code i have to write to check
both the case when i go off the board
and when I don't go off the board so one
way to avoid that is to make sure you
never go off the board cuts the amount
of code in half to some extent a way to
do that is to put in extra squares to
say here are the squares on the board
but let's make another extra square on
each side and just fill that in to say
the value of this square what's in that
square is a border not a real square
that you can play in but if I'm here and
I say what's the value of square number
i minus 1 I get the answer saying its
border rather than getting an answer
that's saying when you go i minus 1 from
position 0 you get an error and i think
i'll use a vertical bar to indicate a
border so i have one there and at the
end of my row i'll have another border
so now I sort of got everything I've got
borders letters empty squares the only
thing left is anchors and I think what
I'll do here is
introduce a special type for anchor I
could have used something like a two
pole or a set of characters I want to
make sure i know and i want to have
something in my code that says if the
value of Rho sub I is an instance of
anchor then I want to do something and
so will make anchor be a class and I
want it to be a class that contains a
set of letters and I can do that in a
very easy way I can use a class
statement to say I'm going to define a
new class the class is called an anchor
and the class is a subset of the set
class and then I don't need anything
else for the definition of the class all
I have to know is that anchors are a
type of set but there a particular type
of set their set of anchor letters so
here's a code for that i define the
class of anchor I have all of my
allowable letters then I say any is an
anchor which allows you to put any
letter on to that anchor spot and now I
want to represent this row we're here
are the borders here are the empty spots
and here are the particular letters and
this representation the schematic
representation as a string does not
account for a fact that after the a
we're going to have to restricted
anchors that have to contain these
characters though we'll define them use
the names mnx and MOA be to be the two
anchors that are restricted to have only
those letters and now our row is equal
to the border square is element number 0
and then the a is element number one
then we have these two restricted
anchors two more empty spots another
anchor where anything can go the be in
the e and so on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
