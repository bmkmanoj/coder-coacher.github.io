class variables both the ones that we
created and the ones that come by
default or predefined in Python classes
I want to take a moment to talk about
the next big idea in object-oriented
programming which is called inheritance
now let's think about the meaning of
this word inheritance and how we use it
in the English language
you may have heard someone say that a
child can inherit some traits from their
parents things like the last name the
eye color some money if the kid is lucky
so if we were to take this meaning of
inheritance like we commonly use it in
the English language and turn it into
code or model this in terms of
programming we would create a class
called parent which will have some
attributes like last name and eye color
and then we would make a class called
class child which would inherit these
two things from the class parent
additionally the class child could have
another variable of its own called
number of toys now you may notice that
if we design code like this we are
already beginning to reuse code which is
a huge advantage of object-oriented
programming okay so the next thing we
are going to do is take our design and
convert it into actual code let's do
that next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
