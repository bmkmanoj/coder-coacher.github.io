loops arrays hashes are some of the most
important concepts in all of programming
will continue to build upon them as this
course progresses everything we've done
so far has been with relatively
simplistic data an array of names a hash
representing a person those types of
examples are important when you're
starting out but they may seem a little
bit trivial it's time for us to step it
up in this session you're going to build
a project using more complex realistic
data imagine that we run an online
retailer toy city that sells the best
toys in all the world you love your job
except for one thing things are not
going well for toy City children
actually hate toys now with a passion to
help turn the business around our boss
has asked us to write an application
that will analyze our product sales data
and generate a nice-looking sales report
here's a preview of the crazy product
sales data will be working with we'll
revisit this project and continue to
improve it in future sessions in this
first iteration we're going to focus on
running some simple analysis on the data
and printing a simple report to the
terminal in future iterations will save
the output to a text file and
incorporate an API this project is a big
step up but don't worry we'll be here to
help you along the way let's go ahead
and take a closer look at the project
specifications and setup</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
