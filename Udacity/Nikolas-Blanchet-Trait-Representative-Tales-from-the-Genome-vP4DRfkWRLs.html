years old I currently live in san
francisco california though i have lived
all over the united states and i am died
have been diagnosed with bipolar 2
disorder and what is bipolar disorder
bipolar disorder is characterized by
long periods of depression like symptoms
so lethargy lack of motivation lack of
ambition periods periods of hopelessness
periods of sadness although not everyone
experiences it in the same way in
addition to that bipolar 2 has fun
little twist where you've also got
periods of what's called hypomania
hypomania is like a less extreme form of
mania mania being where you have a
complete break from reality and you are
hyper energetic hyper optimistic you
usually take a lot of risky behavior for
example sort of the characteristic that
my doctor always tells me to watch out
for is give me a call if you've decided
that you're going to vegas and going to
buy a yacht for the weekend because it
might seem like a lot of fun so bring me
in on the fun i see into then you've
experienced these symptoms yourself I
have hypomania so what I just described
was mania hypomania is a less extreme
form and that's one of the reasons why
bipolar 2 disorder is actually
mischaracterized and misdiagnosed which
was the case with me hypomania in my
case manifested as periods of extreme
sociability hypersexuality extreme
productivity at work and less sleep than
normal also with bipolar disorder the
hypomanic periods are rare so one to two
times a year and fairly brief somewhere
between three and seven days which is
very different than standard mania see
and where were you diagnosed I was
diagnosed bipolar disorder in November
of 2012 okay so you've only known that
for a little bit of time right and how
has that affected you had how how did
that come about so I had been diagnosed
with depression for and this is
apparently by the way of a very typical
story I had been tied diagnose
with depression for about five years i
was going to psychiatrist and
psychologist regularly and they would
prescribe various antidepressants none
of which would work and in fact my
symptoms over time gradually but but
noticeably trended worse and worse and
worse after i moved to the Bay Area my
psychiatrist that I got out here pointed
out that I might actually not be
responding well to the medication
because it was treating something that I
didn't have and instead he suggested
that I switched to mood stabilizers well
the confirming fact came after I was
taking a very high dosage of an
antidepressant and through the end of
november and through most of december i
had a very very bad period of depression
i had no motivation to do anything I was
very sorry I look to the camera no bro I
had a very very bad period of depression
I had no motivation to do anything I
stopped going to work it was pretty bad
and then when I went back in and saw him
again he prescribed a what's called a
mood stabilizer which is different than
an antidepressant a mood stabilizer the
most famous of which is lithium they are
also they're actually the class of drug
is anti epileptic and they they
basically cut off the peaks of bipolar
to disorder which is helpful right so
after you started this regimen of drugs
then you didn't experience the
depression in the hypomania that you've
been experiencing previously right and
another thing I want to point out about
bipolar disorder that makes it so
difficult to to diagnose is you don't go
to you if you think about it you don't
go to your doctor and you don't tell
your doctor by the way my arm is not
broken right you don't tell them you're
not having a problem and when you spend
such a long period of your life in a
dark place and in a depressed state
which is the way bipolar 22 works when
you have these brief periods of
hypomania you feel like that's how your
life should always be because it doesn't
seem alarming and when it's going on and
people aren't alarmed by you because
it's not that complete snap from reality
so when I would go to my doctor I never
mentioned these periods now I don't
have them anymore but I'm a lot more
stable in my day to day life nice well
that leads me to another question about
sort of advantages and disadvantages
here you've touched on them briefly but
from your own perspective I mean are
there any advantages to being or have
you showing symptoms of bipolar and and
I'm also curious in the disadvantages so
the advantages I've never really thought
of it that way one thing they don't tell
you is that hypomania is awesome okay it
feels really good you you're an animal
in bed you are hyper productive at work
you have a lot of energy you are really
social you're really charming you're
really dynamic you can be a little bit
more risky with your behavior but not so
much so the people around you or like
scared for you so people just think
bound it's really on par this weekend
you basically feel like you are king of
the world for a period of time and so I
guess that's an advantage I guess you
could also say there's this
philosophical advantage of knowing what
pain is but let's god that's just crazy
right which is what I am so that's okay
the disadvantages are obviously work
disruption right so that's the biggest
one with me these long drawn-out periods
of silence and you know as a friend of
mine like I would go through periods
where no one would hear from Nick where
is Nick I would just disappear because
keeping up appearances and and making
sure the people around me are
comfortable having a good time is
important to me and so when I was in a
bad place I instead of like being the
negative guy around everyone all the
time I just sort of removed myself from
the situation and of course there's
social stigmas stuff attached with the
two which makes it complicated it makes
it difficult to have relationships it
makes it difficult to stick to tasks I
stopped and started colleges another
number of times and looking back it
probably had a lot to do with this I
don't want to blame this for all of my
problems right i still have good days
and bad days i'm still mortal I still
make mistakes but I suppose now that I
think about it another advantage of
bipolar disorder and having had a
diagnosed is I get insight
I know a little bit more about why
things happen why am I this way why one
it gives context it doesn't excuse
things I still have things I need to
work on but it gives little context
about what my struggles might be about
the things that I need to watch out for
it also makes sure that I exercise
because that's very helpful in your mind
based on the advantages and
disadvantages you share with us if you
could not be bipolar too would you
choose that for yourself at this point
definitely this isn't something this
isn't something like being gay or being
or I don't know being artistic or
something where it might seem like
disadvantage at a period of time in your
life but then contextually it gets you
know better over time or you're able to
socialize it or come to peace with it
even if you come to peace with being
bipolar which I'd like to think I have
but it's pretty quick it's still early
on if only I haven't even been diagnosed
for a year yet even after coming to
peace with it though it's not it's not
really something that is a good thing I
mean if I have kids I'm a carrier for
this potentially from what I understand
you're the geneticist so you tell me but
I've got a huge family history of it it
creates it's something that you have to
disclose when you date which is not fun
see I'd rather not be well so you
touched on two points to that are really
interesting how do other people perceive
you as someone who is bipolar what's the
general reaction how how does it
perceived by others both strangers just
say the general public but also your
friends have they responded and what's
your reaction to their reactions when
people who I know and have known for a
period of time find out that I'm bipolar
I tend to get one of two reactions one
is generally supportive and saying oh
well I'm glad you're getting this
managed I'm glad you've got some stuff
and the other ones sort of like a duh I
could have told you that
not because it manifested because but
because you know there because they have
noticed these trends that I have and
they knew that there was something up
but they never knew what it was and so
okay this makes sense that you've got
this I have I have been let me start
that over I have also sort of taken it
upon myself to sort of raise awareness
it's one of the reasons why I was
willing to do this interview so I do
actually tell people who I don't know
well and I admit it earlier on made it
sounds like the wrong word and I
disclosed this earlier on rather than
later because it's not my fault it's
nothing I did it's just a trait that
I've got I've got blue eyes I've got a
slightly crooked nose I've got a red
beard and red hair I'm also bipolar and
so it's just something that I've
inherited and most people that I've
noticed when I tell them they sort of
the number one reaction I get is they
name someone else that they know and are
close to that that is bipolar one or two
and they immediately look for some sort
of connection and so my reaction to that
when people look to try and humanize it
and make a connection with me as I I
don't know I want to go into detail it
makes me it makes me feel like I'm not
doing this on my own if that makes sense
sure are there any negative reactions do
people ever I mean I heard you make a
joke earlier about you know oh I'm crazy
do people are there any misperceptions
out there that you found about bipolar
and then what are those misperceptions
there's bipolar to specifically I've
noticed also sort of has a other people
who have bipolar 2 disorder a lot of
times they've been living with
depression or bipolar 2 for a very long
time undiagnosed and they've set a lot
of habits in place and they've come to a
lot of I feel like not good self-image
and a lot of people that I've met who
are bipolar to actually want to blame
everything on the illness like they'll
say you know I went you know I I told my
boss here the table I'm bipolar so I
shouldn't have to deal with this and so
that it becomes this tug-of-war but
Queen integration with society becoming
a productive member and actually doing
what you need to do to to handle your
disability um you mentioned previously
to that you said you had a family
history of this now from a genetics
perspective elucidating the genetic
component of bipolar disorder along with
many other mental sort of health
conditions anything from schizophrenia
autism it's been very difficult to
identify a single genetic cause even
several genetic causes most of the
findings have indicated smaller
contributions of individual genes here
and there the search continues with
genome-wide Association studies now
people are trying to move in a whole
genome sequencing of people who have
been diagnosed we're curious in knowing
what is your family history of bipolar
and any other mental health condition
that you think might be related my
family on my mom's side were crazy like
it's just for real real um so my mom my
mom was diagnosed with bipolar 2
disorder and she's acting she was
actually on the same medication that I
am on now for a while but she never told
me this growing up with a sort and and
then you can read up on this more if
you're interested but growing up with
sort of like a mentally ill parent it
causes a lot of like you to react to
things slightly differently like I keep
my mom at an arm's distance and she sort
of felt embarrassed by stuff and so
there wasn't a lot of disclosure about
the health situations and the traits
that we've got so I'm only recently
finding out a lot of the stuff that my
mom's got she's also been diagnosed well
i'm going to caveat this by saying that
this is all reported by my mother so i
actually obviously don't am not privy to
her medical records but according to my
mother there are also depression and a
DD and and sometimes depending the
doctor she sees a personality disorder
like borderline or something my sister
one of my younger sisters suffers from
depression my dad
is the actually on that side of the
family he is the most a DD person I have
ever met in my entire life like you know
the Wikipedia hole we just click
clicking on hyperlink up to hyperlink up
to hyperlink until you got a million
tabs open yeah like he can't use
Wikipedia because it's paralyzing his
weekend will be gone so it sounds like
you have you no immediate and extended
family that have also demonstrated
similar symptoms of depression possibly
even mania like you say your mom
hypomania right and how does that make
you feel about a connection with other
people genetically speaking in otherwise
you feel a kinship with other people who
have been diagnosed with bipolar or do
you think of these people as they're
just other people and happens to be a
trade as well or is this part of a
broader thread that you think ties you
to other people well I definitely the
shared experience but the social stigma
against a lot of mental illness is
particularly bipolar to disorder because
it just looks like laziness a lot of the
time the social stigma they're actually
even affects the people who have it
right so I find myself and I'm not you
know thinking this through behaving
logically I find myself not wanting to
associate with other bipolar people
wanting to hold them at arm's distance
not one to find some sort of community
because what we have in common what
we're all crazy why should we celebrate
that this is a problem and yet that
shared experience is helpful sometimes
you can get insights from very
interesting in different places that you
would never think about so and about
areas of your life and managing areas of
your life like the exercise thing
exercise has been a huge impact on my
life and that I mean my doctor mentioned
it but it didn't really sink in until I
saw the high functioning people who were
bipolar to all exercised and then again
maybe I thought they were high
functioning because they exercised and I
was like that's what it is for me I
don't know so when you you when you
bring that up just to sort of give all
of our students a generally well-rounded
perspective here are you telling us that
bipolar 2 is manageable
very manageable bipolar 2 is unlike some
other mental illnesses a bipolar 2 is
it's incredibly manageable with
medication alone actually it responds
extremely well some of the more modern
psychological treatments like cognitive
behavioral therapy they have had some
success as well but not nearly as much
as they've had in other areas this is
very easily fixed and managed with just
taking a pill every day okay do you know
of any specific genetic risk that you
have for bipolar I've you and your
doctor told you about specific genetic
risk you might have or if you discovered
any particular gene or genetic risk you
might have for bipolar I've been told
and I've been told that it is heritable
that it was likely my family but that
doesn't necessarily mean genetic so I
wasn't told specifically about genetics
what do you think about the portrayal of
mental health in general both in media
and in society at large how we deal with
it as a population do you think we take
mental health seriously do you think
it's portrayed in a meaningful way that
gets the right kind of attention or do
you think we still have some work to do
I definitely believe that in the area of
portrayal of mental health well in the
area of how the average person thinks of
mental health we have some work to do
because it's one it's easy to look at
someone and say you have a broken leg
you have a scratch you've been burned
but when it permeates the mind when it
permeates the thing that's sitting
behind the eyes and looking back at you
it's hard to say well you're an asshole
versus you have an issue and because
it's so difficult to recognize in the
first place we tend to overlook it
minimize it and and not give it the type
of treatment that we should I went
through a period actually where
insurance was not quite clear for me and
so I ended up going to a public clinic
to try and get some assistance with this
not long after my diagnosis and it was
I'm glad the public clinic existed it
was it was nice that Santa the city of
San Francisco who funded it has decided
to make this type of program available
but it was dehumanizing I it was there
six slots available on a Saturday and
the doors open at nine and you're
allowed to you're allowed to start
lining up at 7am if you're the seventh
person in line you will not be seen and
so i got up at 6am i made my way down to
soma which is quasi sketchy area of san
francisco and i waited in line with
other people who were potentially
violently mentally ill and i knew
nothing about it and for you know the
first hour and a half it was completely
unsupervised there was no one there
there was no guard there's no nothing it
was just a bunch of people were there
several people who had had chronic
mental illness came up and had gotten
into line and then when the security
guard finally came she recognized a lot
of these individuals as people who
apparently came very frequently and told
them that we already had the correct
number of people in line so basically
turning them away even though they were
in the correct order in line and that
whole period it made me recognize that a
lot of these people who were in line I
mean that all autumn had been addicted
they now had that we're missing their
teeth they were now had impossibly
weren't even very educated to begin with
and these are people who certain people
in certain areas in America they
consider people like that did you be
just be leeches on society to pay be
people who should be not assisted
because they should just fix their own
lives and I look at them and I see how
lucky I am to be privileged in many ways
to actually have been educated to have
them to have
better than average mind that sounds
really conceited too to have sort of
some of these self-perceptions and tools
and that I'm able to get help and I
wonder when I see them if they were able
to get help earlier how different would
their lives be with their lives actually
have been very productive or they've
been able to get back like I've been
able to do so yeah I think that there
are major challenges if you could say
one thing or one message generally
speaking to other people who have
bipolar one or two or people who may
wonder if they do maybe haven't been
diagnosed but it's been going through
issues themselves if you could give them
a message for tell them something is
there anything in particular you would
want to say if I had have a message for
somebody who's bipolar too I would
definitely say seek medical assistance
ah this is something that responds very
well to treatment and once you've gotten
the proper treatment once you've been
able to help yourself out then you can
live a very very satisfying and happy
life if you can't afford medical
treatment exercise it actually goes a
long way</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
