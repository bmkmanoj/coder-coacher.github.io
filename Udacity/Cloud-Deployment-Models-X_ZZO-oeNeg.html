Technology which adapted a definition
for cloud computing in 2011 also define
different types of clouds the first
dimension how clouds are classified is
based on the deployment models clouds
can be public like Amazon's ec2 cloud is
a public law and this is a plot where
the infrastructure belongs to the cloud
provider
however third-party customers or tenants
anyone with a credit card currently can
come in and I run their services their
infrastructure on top of Amazon's owned
hardware clouds can be private I said
earlier that Amazon used the same type
of technology that they opened up as
Amazon Web Services they used it
originally internally to enable elastic
and dynamic provisioning of the physical
infrastructure across the different
types of applications and services that
Amazon internally executes in the case
of a private cloud it is the
infrastructure as well as the tenants
the services the applications that are
run on top of that infrastructure
everything is owned by the same entity
and it's just cloud computing technology
is used to enable some of the
provisioning and the elasticity that
cloud computing offers to applications
then there is a hybrid cloud as a
possible deployment model this is a
scenario where a private cloud is
interfaced with some public cloud where
these public resources are used either
for failover for some additional
redundancy for dealing with spikes or I
know certain companies which use these
public resources to run simulated
workloads that would then generate
suppose that requests patterns on top of
their privately run core services
finally the definition also references
that there is a community cloud as a
type of cloud this is really just a
public cloud where the third-party
customers the third party users of the
services or the information that's
provided by this community cloud isn't
really just used by arbitrary customers
but by a certain type of users</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
