angle of the sun's rays in Alexandria
can be done as precisely as we'd like
and so this error is negligible which is
interesting you may not have thought
that the sexual the sexual measurement
seems more difficult than just verifying
something as vertical but it turns out
this was the negligible one and this
could introduce about twenty percent
error next we have measuring the
distance between Siena and Alexandria
and what is there to say about this one
to estimate this distance between CNA
and Alexandria surveyors at the time
would time camels and using some
assumptions based on how quickly a camel
would walk they wouldn't for a distance
between these two cities now you can
probably tell this is not the best way
to measure distance maybe his camel
walked in a perfectly straight line that
constant speed and the measurement went
perfectly but somehow I doubt that
in fact with all the zigzagging in camel
speeding up and slowing down I'd
estimate the uncertainty here to be
about 10 to 20 percent and this is truly
a pretty large source of error an error
in distance measurement of 10 to 20
percent well let's just say 15 percent
for simplicity sake we need to propagate
this through and determine how much this
affects our circumference measurement so
let's go back to our equation and the
circumference is 360 over alpha times
this distance D and this distance has an
uncertainty of 15 percent which means
that instead of being five thousand
stadia actually five thousand plus or
minus 750 stadia
so we can do what we did last time and
say well D max the maximum possible
value for D would be five thousand seven
hundred fifty
stadia D min would be four thousand two
hundred and fifty stadia and we can
calculate circumference is based on that
and then use those calculations to
determine the percent error so we know
that using D average so just using this
five thousand stadia results in a
circumference of forty six thousand two
hundred fifty
others now I want you to fill in these
blanks what is the circumference if we
use D max so that would be 5000 plus 750
stadia and once you've calculated that
how far off percentage-wise is that from
forty six thousand two hundred fifty do
the same thing for demon and as a
reminder one stadium is 185 meters and
alpha which is this angle here in the
equation is 7.2 degrees so go ahead and
fill this out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
