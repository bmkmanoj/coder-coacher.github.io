always satisfied and satisfied in this
case over here it's satisfied in this
case over here and this one the only one
where it's not satisfied is this one
here and of course that's easy to
evaluate so if x1 and x2 and x3
evaluates to true then we have the big
knot which will make it go to 0 and 0 or
1 is equal to 1 so the boolean formula
is satisfied but 0 or 0 evaluates to 0
so here the boolean formula is not
satisfied and for these two cases the
boolean formula is simply satisfied
because if this goes to 0 then we have
the big knot over here so it will go to
1 and 1 or 1 and 1 or 0 that also
evaluates to 1 what does this have to do
with an if-then well it's actually quite
simple if this part here x1 and x2 and
x3 evaluates to 1 then this part over
here must also be one in order to
satisfy the boolean formula it does not
work if this part over here is 0 and in
the other case where x1 and x2 and x3
evaluates to 0 well then as you can see
we basically don't care what the other
variables are doing because the boolean
formula is already satisfied and that is
exactly how an if-then behaves if the
condition is satisfied then we want
something specific to happen if the
conditions are not satisfied we don't
really care what happens or at least
we're not really going to force anything
to happen</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
