we're working with a partially filled
array so do we want to use an enhanced
for loop or a regular for loop if we use
the enhanced for loop it'll add up every
single item even the ones in the part of
the array that we've said is empty we
know that the current size is four but
the enhanced for loop just knows how
much space there is in the whole array
in this case the enhanced for loop will
work but only because the array was
initialized full of zeros so when we
take the sum and we add all of these
zeros it won't actually give us the
wrong answer but if I were dealing with
an array that might have extra junk left
over in the empty space I would probably
want to use a regular for loop and only
go up to the current size of 4 i'll show
you both of those either way I'll need
my some that starts at zero and I'll
return that some at the end if I use the
enhanced for loop I just increment the
sum by score each time and that should
work but if I'm nervous that there might
be other junk left over in the end of my
array then I would declare a loop
counter variable and stop before it gets
up to current size and look at each item
one at a time and here I would have to
get the item out of scores because i'm
not using an enhanced for loop anymore
and i should probably actually give my
loop counter variable an initial value
now we can see this in action if I run
the demo and enter my scores I get their
total</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
