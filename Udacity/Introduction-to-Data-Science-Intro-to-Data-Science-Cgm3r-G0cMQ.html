science my name is Dave and I'll be the
instructor for this course I've worked
as a data scientist in Silicon Valley
most recently at a small company called
Yub and before that at a company called
trial pay
I'm formerly trained as a physicist and
I originally became interested in data
science because I loved the idea of
improving the quality of people's lives
or building really cool products by
using data and mathematics in this
lesson we'll discuss data science at a
high level together we'll find out what
data science is and discuss what skills
are required to be a data scientist
we'll also hear from a bunch of other
data scientists about interesting
projects they've worked on and discuss
how data science is being used to solve
a bunch of different problems this
lesson in particular is going to be a
little bit different than the others
we're not going to build as much I think
it's important to understand data
science at a high level before we dive
into the details all right well I'm
really excited about this course so why
don't we get started</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
