protein or enzyme called tyrosinase well
tyrosinase is the rate-limiting step and
the production of melanin there are many
steps to making the pigment melanin and
some of the first are converting a
molecule called tyrosine actually
tyrosine the very amino acid we've
learned about and is in our amino acid
alphabet into another molecule called
dopa and from dope and dope aqua nam
tyrosinase performs this function but
it's pretty slow actually compared to
all the other steps you need to get
melanin this is the part that takes the
longest so this single nucleotide
variation up here the site is seeing to
an adenine the change an amino acid from
serine to tyrosine ironically enough
causes right that's a missense mutation
now which causes tyrosinase to work
forty to fifty percent slower than it
normally does so if this is true we
would expect to see a decrease in
overall melanin because we're going to
make it a lot slower if we have less
melanin we're going to have lighter skin
we have lighter skin we're going to have
more UV rays that are able to get into
the cells so that they can simulate by
the Mindy production so this particular
mutation will give you lighter skin
whereas this sequence promotes darker
skin now there are actually several
other genes that affect skin
pigmentation and they all have multiple
alleles that explain all kinds of
intermediate pigmentation as well as
red-haired individuals but this is just
one example of how a single nucleotide
variation in the coding region causing a
missense mutation from a searing to a
tyrosine slows the enzymes function by
forty or fifty percent allowing for less
pigment and the skin thus letting more
sunlight in to produce vitamin D of
course the flip side of this is the more
sunlight you let in the more risk you
are for DNA damage and that's why
light-skinned people when they're in
really UV intense regions are much
higher risk for skin cancer than dark
pigmented people let's go talk to
somebody who knows quite a bit about
living in hot
yuvi rich equatorial regions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
