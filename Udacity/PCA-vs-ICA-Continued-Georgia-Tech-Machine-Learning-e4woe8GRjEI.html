examples Michael of how PCA and ICA
differ and I'm going to do this mainly
by talking about certain things that I
see a does and this is really just for
your edification but I think it really
helps to think about those sort of
underlying models and how they differ by
thinking about how they react
differently to different kinds of data
so just here's a couple of examples the
one we covered right away was the blind
source separation problem and of course
we what we recall is that I say in some
sense was designed to solve the blind
source separation problem and in fact
ICA does an excellent job at solving the
blind source separation problem
meanwhile PCA does a terrible job at
solving the blind source separation
problem and that's just because it's
assuming these kind of Gaussian
distribution of blind source route in it
it's actually a directional and what I
mean by that is you recall I drew this
sort of matrix before where we had
features this way and we had samples of
those features like sound time samples
of sound this way it turns out that for
PCA it doesn't matter whether I give you
this matrix or I give you the transpose
of this matrix it ends up finding the
same answer and that should make sense
right because it's just basically
finding a new rotation of the data and
these are effectively just rotations of
each other for the purposes of if you
just kind of think about it
geometrically in space I see on the
other hand gives you completely
different answers if you give it this
versus giving it this so ICA is highly
directional in PCA
much lesser but ICA because it's making
this kind of fundamental assumption does
end up generating some really cool
results so I'm going to give you another
example of one that's like the blind
source separation one in fact I'm going
to give you two okay so imagine you had
a bunch of inputs of faces okay so
here's my input faces I gave you bunches
and bunches and bunches of faces what do
you think PCA would do what do you think
the first principal component of PCA
would be
over pictures of thousands and thousands
and thousands of faces overall darkness
of the image actually that's exactly
right the first thing that PCA tends to
do with images were actually talking
pictures not just sketches here is it
finds the direction of maximal variance
and that tends to be brightness or
luminance which kind of makes sense
because that's typically the kind of
thing that gets very the most so in fact
the first thing people often do when
they're trying to use PCA on faces is
they normalize all of that away because
the first principal component isn't
terribly helpful it's just kind of
giving you the average light what do you
think the second thing it would find
would be hair versus not hair no
interestingly enough what it ends up
finding is sort of the average face
which is kind of like that the question
you asked me earlier about what happens
if you go through the origin so there's
actually names for this it's called the
eigenfaces because you know as I noted
before it's a nagging problem and it
basically finds kind of the average face
and that's kind of weird but it works
for reconstruction I don't know what the
average face here would look like
probably something like this yeah so you
can see how useful that would be not
even clear that's a face but it works
for reconstruction you know what ICA
ends up finding noses yes it finds noses
it finds eye selectors it finds mouth
selectors it finds hair selectors and I
think intuitively the way I would think
about this is because PCA is doing this
global orthogonality thing it's going to
be forced to find global features ICA
and then say was global that's because
it's basically local it doesn't care
about orthogonality so it tends to find
parts of if you feed it the matrix the
right way it tends to find parts of and
so it ends up finding these little
selectors so this has a really nice
outcome in cases like natural images or
natural scenes so what do you think
happens Michael if I take natural scenes
you know pictures of the forest and
grass and walking around just things
that I would see if I were just walking
out in the world and taking bunches of
pictures and I feed it into ICA well the
answer for PCA by the way is the same as
before you get brightness you get sort
of the average image things that really
make sense if your goal is to do
reconstruction but ICA actually gives
you something different what do you
think the indepen
components the underlying causes so to
speak of natural scenes are I'm still
thinking about the face parts but by
analogy it seems like it would be the
you know things in the world like trees
and rocks and ground not quite and
that's I think in part because there are
too many of those things that kind of
overlap in too many different ways it
actually finds something more
fundamental edges that's exactly right
ICA finds edges now for me that is
incredibly satisfying it says that the
independent components of the world are
edges now there are two things that come
out of this one is just a satisfying
feeling you get by realizing that
there's a ger its own recovers something
fundamental like edges that's very nice
but the second thing that's nice about
it is once I use ICA to do my feature
transformation and discover that what
it's learning our edge detectors well
then I can just right edge detectors I
can just write algorithms that are very
fast very efficient that can go through
images of natural scenes and pull out
the edges it's unclear how to do that
with you know different principle
projections but if edges are the
fundamental building blocks of natural
scenes then there are people who know
how to write edge detectors very quickly
by the way you get a similar result I
won't talk about it but you get a
similar result in our information
retrieval problem where you have
documents and you can read this in the
material we give you but what ICA ends
up giving you for documents are topics
and they're very easily interpreted that
way collections of words that select for
specific topics that are themselves made
up of collections of words that select
for topics and collections of
uncorrelated words that get rid of
distractor documents so the independent
components of scenes are edges and the
independent components of documents are
topics and that feels very nice but in
both of these cases both with edges and
with topics it turns out that the form
of these topics are something that you
can compute very very quickly and sort
of independently of the underlying ICA
algorithm so why does that matter
Michael well remember what I said
originally about unsupervised learning
what it was good for was understanding
your data doing kind of data and
analysis from a human beings point of
view so what's something like ICA and
other algorithms we might imagine do is
they allow you to do analysis over your
data to discover fundamental features of
them like edges or topics or noses and
eyes and then once you understand that's
what's making up your data you can
simply write code that will select for
it or figure out what the important
parts of your data are correspondingly
and so here we haven't just done this
feature transformation problem for the
sake of doing classification feature
transformation actually helps us to
understand the fundamental underlying
causes or at least structure of our data</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
