answer here is stress testing so we're
not doing regression testing because
regression testing always involves
taking inputs that previously made the
system fail and replaying them against
the system and the way I described it
that wasn't the case here we're probably
not doing unit testing because the
software under test running on this
processor even if it's just one part of
all of the software running on a car it
still has many modules it has an
operating system has some communication
software it has the actual application
functionality whatever it's doing
controlling airbags and so we're most
likely not doing unit testing although
if you answered unit testing that's not
a bad answer but my personal judgment
isn't is it it is that it's not the best
one and we're certainly not doing white
box testing because we haven't
considered at all the structure of the
software under test here we are this is
really a kind of black box testing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
