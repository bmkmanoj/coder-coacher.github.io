company now one of the best pieces of
management advice that I've ever read
actually my co-founder Dan I spoke with
did cost low at Twitter and Dick said
something that has stuck with me ever
since and it's that the hardest thing
about management is making everyone else
understand what you understand and when
you think about this from a
problem-solving context first of all
there are always problems
there's always something blowing up or
something going wrong and it's really
hard as a growing manager you know I've
never had any experience doing this
my co-founder hadn't either it's a
really really difficult thing to train
yourself to when something goes really
wrong don't try and solve the problem
yourself instead think of your job as
getting everybody else to understand as
much as they can about the problem and
so you might think that as as your job
as a leader is to sort of present a
happy face and make it seem like
everything's rosy all the time to
motivate people but it's actually not
the job the job is to make everybody as
aware of the problems as possible and to
help get them rallied around solving
them instead and so that means
confronting things openly being aware of
reality and trying to communicate as
much as you can with the team about it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
