to my terminal instead of looking at a
GCC bug we're going to look at an lvm
bug and I believe this is one we already
looked at a little bit so we say client
a show two small dot see it's going to
die with an assertion violation about is
an argument Val and unknown live into
the entry block and that's assertion
failed so we need to do first is check
if the level van people already know
about this one so we're going to go here
to there bugzilla and search for this
exact string alright so they don't know
about this book's that's nice so we know
about a bug they don't know about it we
can report it so now we have to go back
and make a reduced test case what I'm
going to do here is instead of invoking
the Delta debugger which is this nice
extremely general-purpose powerful tool
I'm going to book a different tool it's
called see reduced and it's one produced
by my group and what it is is an
extremely special purpose Delta debugger
so it operates on exactly the same Delta
debugging ideas that the that the other
tool operates by and it just has extra
knowledge embedded in it about how to
reduce see programs this is going to
take a little while so you don't have to
wait for it like I do let's run a time
commanded to see how long it takes all
right that took about 11 minutes so not
incredibly quick but not too shabby
either cuz remember this with this
wasn't some time that I had to be
attending to a computer the computer was
just doing an automated search algorithm
and so here the out here the output the
reduced test case is pretty small so
let's check out spike count so 274 bites
so that's nice so what I'm going to do
here is make a bug report and what I'm
going to first do is make sure we know
the version of crying so its version 15
69 70 I'm going to make sure the test
case gets included and I'm going to show
client crashing on it okay so that's a
bug report and so if I haven't appeared
to go through all of the steps that I've
narrated to you earlier it's because it
reported a lot of compiler bugs and I
know I get what I can get away with so
there we go so this includes I believe
enough information for the lvm people to
reproduce the bug should be good and
I've marked with reporting its trunk and
we just need a name for this bug report
okay the bugzilla is trying to help us
avoid a duplicate and I don't think it
told us about anything that we didn't
know in fact all these are marked as
fixed anyway so we're good and let us
ship this off okay good now the lvm
developers when they get up in the
morning have a new bug report to look at
and that concludes our be out on bug
reporting</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
