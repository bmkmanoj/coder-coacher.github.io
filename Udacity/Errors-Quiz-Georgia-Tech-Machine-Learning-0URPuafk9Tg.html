can't just solve these kinds of problems
by solving a system of linear equations
and just being done with it the reason
we have to do these squares is because
of the presence of errors the training
data that that we are given has errors
in it and it's not that we're actually
modeling a function but the thing that
we're seeing is the function plus some
you know some error term on each piece
of data so I think it's reasonable to
think about look where do these errors
come from so I don't know what do you
think Charles why why is it that we're
trying to fit data that has errors in it
can't we just we just have no errors I
would like to have no errors certainly
my code has no errors well so let's see
where my errors come from so they could
come from sensor error right just
somehow you're getting inputs and you're
getting outputs and that outputs being
read by some machine or by a camera or
by something and you just there's just
error in the way that you read the data
it's just there in the sensors all right
can you think of other ways I mean I
guess I guess in this case you're
imagining that the data came by actually
measuring something with the machine so
that that makes a lot of sense what
other what other ways can we put
together the data uh I don't know I
could think of a bunch I mean the error
could well the errors could come
maliciously there could be some
something out there that is trying to
give us bad data all right that seems
like a possibility that when when the
data set was collected let's say that
we're collecting various oh maybe five
oh this happens this happens a lot so if
you're trying to collect data from other
computer science departments and you're
trying to put together some kind of
collection of you know how much do you
spend on your graduate students say
sometimes these departments will
actually misrepresent the data and give
you give you things that are wrong
because they don't want to tell you the
truth because they're afraid of what
you're going to do it yeah everyone does
that except for Georgia Tech and Brown
University yeah there are highly honest
and reputable universities in my
experience that's what well another time
that you can get data is if somebody's
copying stuff down so what about sort of
the idea of a transcription error so
we're just you know we've copied
everything but you know there's there's
just some of the
some of the lines that got filled in
just got mistyped yeah I do you think
that's different from sensor error well
it's it's maybe a slightly different
kind of sensor error right so sensor
errors were actually saying there's
something physical that's being measured
and there's just noise in that
transcription error is similar except
it's a person right there's a little
blips in the person's head and they can
do it can't be a very different kind of
error you can get like transpositions of
digits maybe instead of just you know
how about about one more how about
there's really just noise in the process
so how about that we took an input X but
there's something else going on in the
world that we weren't measuring and so
the output might depend on other things
besides simply the input that we're
looking right so what would be an
example of that so an unmodeled
influence might be well let's if we're
the housing day that's what that's what
I was thinking exactly so the in the
housing data we were just trying to
relate the size of the houses to the
price but there's a lot of other things
like to the houses to the price location
location location and location right
those are three really good reasons that
are not in the particular regression
that we did that could actually
influence the the prices so write that
and you know the quality the house and
who built it and even you've been then
collenchyma dealers or what the interest
rates were that morning versus the nig
what people thought they might be the
next day yes right and so all these
different things aren't being considered
in that particular regression so we're
just kind of imagining that it's noise
that's just having a just a bumpy
influence on the whole process sure all
right so so what I'd like you to do is
select the ones that you think actually
are important the ones that that that
could actually come up when you're using
machine learning and regression to solve
real problems</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
