first we're going to transfer the idea
that the force between the nucleus and
the electron is caused by the fact that
both the nucleus and the electron have
mass we notice that the relationships up
here or similar to the relations Dover
here so we're going to infer that the
explanation is the same as well so the
nucleus has mass and the electron has
mass and those are going to cause the
force between a nucleus and electron
we're also going to transfer the idea
that because the electron revolves
around the nucleus that means that the
nucleus must have a greater mass than
the electron the planet revolves around
the Sun because the sun's mass is
greater than the planet so the electron
must revolve around the nucleus because
the nucleus is mass is greater than the
electrons we wouldn't transfer the idea
that the nucleus is a son or the
electrons are planets because those take
the transfer a little bit too literally
we also wouldn't transfer the idea that
the nucleus attracts electrons or the
electron revolves around the nucleus
because those were already in our
original representation so we end up
with this the nucleus and the electron
both having mass causes the force
between them and the nucleus is mass
being greater than the electrons mass
causes the electron to revolve around
the nucleus there's a smart answer David
recalled it originally I had said that
I'll explain structural similarity and I
have not done it so far I'm going to use
this particular example and David's
answer to explain it now given the solar
system is the source case and the atomic
structure target problem we can see that
there is little semantic similarity
between them the kinds of objects that
are occurring the solar system are not
at all like the kinds of objects that
are occurring the atomic structure we
can also see the pragmatic similarity is
not a major issue here we are not
talking about the goal of the solar
system or the goal of the atomic
structure although we might have the
goal of understanding atomic structure
in the solar system there is nothing in
the solar system or in the atomic
structure which has a goal yet David was
able to answer this question correctly
this is because of structural similarity
let us consider the top part of the
model resource system you can think of
this top part like a graph the vertices
in this graph correspond to objects and
the properties the edges in this graph
correspond to relationships such as
force between Sun and planet or
attracts planet and pan attack right son
once again this graphical representation
of the model atomic structure the
vertices representing the objects and
the features and the edges are
representing the relationship between
the objects although there is a little
semantic similarity or pragmatic
similarity between the two situations we
can see a structural similarity a
similarity in the structure of the
graphs they cause this part of the graph
of the representative solar system is
similar to this part of the graph of the
representative of the atomic structure
we can day for infer that we can
transfer this part of the graph of the
solar system to infer this part of the
graph of the atomic structure structural
similarity then captures relational
similarity what is common between these
three situations is neither the objects
not goals what is common here is the
relational similarity and that is what
structural similarity captions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
