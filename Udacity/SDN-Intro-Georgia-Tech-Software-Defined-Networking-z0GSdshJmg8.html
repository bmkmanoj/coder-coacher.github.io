which is an SDN language and runtime
that implements some of the composition
operators that we discussed in the last
lesson the language is a way of
expressing these high-level policies and
the runtime provides the function of
compiling these policies to the open
flow rules that eventually are installed
on the switches one key abstraction in
PI retic is the notion of located
packets the idea that we can apply a
policy based on a packet and its
location in the network such as the
switch at which that packet is located
or the port on which that packet arrives
ironic offers several features the first
is the ability to take as input a packet
and then return packets at different
locations in the network this
effectively allows the implementation of
network policy as a function that simply
takes packets and returns other packets
at different locations the second
feature of pi retic is the notion of
boolean predicates unlike open flow
rules which do not permit the expression
of simple conjunctions such as an and or
or negations like not paretic allows the
expression of policies in terms of these
predicates Heretic also provides the
notion of virtual packet header fields
which allows the programmer to refer to
packet locations and also to tag packets
so that specific functions can be
applied at different portions of the
program paretic also provides
composition operators such as parallel
and sequential composition which we
discussed in the last lesson the notion
of network policy as a function
contrasts with the open flow style of
programming in open flow policies are
simply bit patterns in other words match
statements for which matching packets
are subject to a particular action these
types of policies can be particularly
difficult to reason about in contrast in
PI retic policies are functions that map
packets to other packets some example
functions in PI retic include the
identity function which returns the
original packet nun or drop
which returns the empty set match which
returns the identity if the field F
matches the value V and returns none or
drop otherwise mod which returns the
same packet with the field F set to V
forward which is simply syntactic sugar
on mod to say that the output port
filled in the packet should be modified
to the parameter of specified and flood
which returns one packet for each port
on the network spanning tree in open
flow packets either match on a rule or
they simply fall through to the next
rule so or not etc can be tough to
reason about
in contrast Poetics match function
outputs either the packet or nothing
depending on whether the predicate is
satisfied for example we could apply a
match statement that says match
destination IP equals 1000 3 and this
function would take packets as input and
only return packets that satisfy this
particular predicate in addition to the
standard packet header fields PI retic
offers the notion of virtual packet
header fields which is a unified way of
representing packet metadata in PI retik
the packet is nothing more than a
dictionary that map's a field name such
as the destination IP address to a value
now these field names could correspond
to fields in an actual packet header but
they can also be virtual for example we
could provide a match statement based on
a switch indicating that we only want to
return packets that are located at a
particular switch or on the input port
indicating that we only want to see
packets whose attributes match a
particular input port the match function
matches on this packet metadata and the
mod function can modify this metadata</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
