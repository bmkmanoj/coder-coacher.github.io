of our variables and the overall demand
for diamonds let's replay data this time
we'll put price on a log 10 scale and
here's what it looks like this plot
looks better than before on the log
scale the prices look less dispersed at
the high end of carat size and price but
actually we can do better let's try
using the cube root of carrot in light
of our speculation about flaws being
exponentially more likely in diamonds
with more volume remember volume is on
cubic scale first we needed a function
to transform the carrot variable if
you'd like to learn more about writing
your own functions in our check out the
links in the instructor notes this may
seem like a lot of code but really
there's only one new piece here it's
this cube root trans function it's a
function that takes the cube root of any
input variable and it also has an
inverse function to undo that operation
which we need to display the plot
correctly then when we get to our actual
ggplot command what we'll do is we'll
use the scale X continuous argument to
transform the x-axis with this cube root
transformation function keep in mind
we're also transforming the y-axis with
this log 10 transformation that we
discussed previously and let's see what
this plot looks like taking a look at
the plot we can actually see that with
these transformations that we use to get
our data on this nice scale things look
almost linear we can now move forward
and see about modeling our data using
just a linear model</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
