is with the premium model you just
submit your game to the app store and
pick a price and most app stores will
automatically convert the price you
choose to the correct currency for all
the markets you want to sell your app in
for example if you want to sell to an
American market and choose a price of
ninety nine cents for your game the App
Store will convert this to the
appropriate currency for other countries
like point seven five euros for the
European market but even though this is
the simplest way to monetize your game
most games are still free people don't
want to take the risk of by ona games
that don't know much about and so
freemium games reach the widest audience
and it can be hard to choose between
making your game premium or freemium in
fact many developers offer both options
they offer a free version to reach as
many people as they can and also a
premium version that has some benefit
for more invested players it's really
common to have a freemium option with
ads and a premium version that doesn't
this way both versions of the game make
money and the player can choose whether
or not to pay next let's look at an
example of a real game and see which
monetization model we think works best</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
