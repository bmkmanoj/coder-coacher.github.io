into is to nail down a concept called
pact learning so to do that we're going
to delve into what the error of
hypothesis is and there's two kinds of
errors
there's the training error and the true
error so the training error is on the on
the training set what is the fraction of
those examples that are misclassified by
some given hypothesis H okay now H could
be different from the target concept the
target concept ought to have a training
error of 0 but the but some other
hypothesis H might have some error ok
sure that make sense all right now the
true error is actually the fraction of
examples that would be misclassified on
a sample drawn from D in essentially the
infinite limit so what is the
essentially the probability that a
sample drawn from D would be
misclassified by some hypothesis H ok
and we can actually write that
mathematically error with respect to
some distribution D of some hypothesis H
is the probability that if we draw the
input X from that distribution that
you're going to get a mismatch between
the true label according to the concept
and the hypothesis that we're currently
evaluating right so this sort of
captures the notion that it's okay for
you to miss classify examples you will
never ever ever see yes that's right so
we're only being penalized proportional
to the probability of getting that thing
wrong so for examples that we never see
that's fine for examples that we see
really really rarely we get only a tiny
little bit of contribution to the
overall error okay hang up all of that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
