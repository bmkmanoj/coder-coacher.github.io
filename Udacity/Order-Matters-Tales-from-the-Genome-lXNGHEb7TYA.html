give you a sense of genetic identity
with other humans around you but it's
not just the presence of similar snv's
that gives away clues to relatedness but
it's also the order of the SNP's
remember when personal genetic
information is obtained not only is the
individual s and V determined but we
know where exactly its placement is on
the chromosome this order on the
chromosome is significant when we
consider that your genome is one set of
chromosomes from one parent and one set
of chromosomes from another what if
instead of doing a point-by-point
comparison of snv's we actually looked
at the order in which you share them
along the length of a chromosome for
example let's say you find that you're
fifty percent related to an individual
now this is not fifty percent IBS okay
this is not what we're talking about
we're talking about relatedness you're
fifty percent are half related to
someone in the genetics world are only
two options that allow you to be half
exactly half related to someone you're
half related to a parent right you have
two parents you received half your
chromosomes from one in half from
another and you're also half related to
one of your full siblings so based on
what you know about chromosome
transmission and recombination which we
learned about in lesson five which of
the following chromosome comparison
diagrams indicates a parental
relationship in which one indicates a
full sibling relationship now in this
particular scenario the shaded areas are
whole lengths of shared snv's so this is
where we had an IBS match these SMBs
matched with the other person remember
you have two copies of every chromosome
so imagine that these are your
chromosomes and in this scenario you
match them with an individual and you
see the shaded regions are shared you
match with another individual and you
see that the shaded region is shared
here along the length of the whole
chromosome but not the other indicate
which one is the parental relationship
and which one is the full sibling
relationship by entering the number one
or the number two in the text box as you
see here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
