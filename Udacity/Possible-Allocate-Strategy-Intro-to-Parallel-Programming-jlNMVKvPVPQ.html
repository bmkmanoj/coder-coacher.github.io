is to allocate the maximum space per
element in this case we would create an
output array with five output triangles
per input triangle we're gonna put these
in an intermediate array and then
compact the result however this has two
significant disadvantages the first is
that it's really wasteful in space
we've now allocated an intermediate
array that has the maximum amount of
space per element and that's going to
lead to a very large array overall the
second disadvantage is that now we have
to scan this large intermediate array
and that's not going to be as efficient
as we would like either so how can we do
this more efficiently so let's go back
to what we'd really like to do what we'd
like to do is have a list of allocation
requests one per input element and then
get back a location to write your
requests as an example let's say we have
eight input triangles here and those
eight triangles want to generate in
order 1 0 1 2 1 0 3 &amp;amp; 0
triangles so what's that going to look
like the first input element is going to
want to write it's one triangle here
into the output array the second
triangle isn't going to have any output
elements to write the third input
triangle is going to write into this
element here the next triangle has two
outputs it will write them into the next
two slots of the array the next triangle
wants to write its output here the next
triangle wants to write nothing the next
triangle wants to write its output into
these three output slots so what we want
to generate here is the output addresses
for these he wants to write his output
into address 0 he wants to write his
output into address 1 he wants to write
his output into address 2 and 3 and this
guy wants to write his output into
addresses 5 6 &amp;amp; 7 and so on and look
this is exclusive scan as well it
generalizes what we did with compact in
compact we allocated one slot in the
output array for each true element and 0
for each false elements instead now
we've generalized this so that we simply
indicate in the input array the exact
number that we need this is simpler and
it's more efficient instead of scanning
an array that has the maximum possible
allocation for
all elements in the case of clipping
five times the size of the input array
now we just have to scan something the
size of the input array so it's more
efficient to be able to do it this way
so that's a couple of interesting
applications of scan if you're doing any
sort of GPU programming with their
regular workloads you'll find that scan
comes up all the time
recent work has used scan and diverse
application domains such as graph
traversal data compression and collision
detection among many others and we'll
see later in this lecture that scan is
the core of the fastest GPU sort as well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
