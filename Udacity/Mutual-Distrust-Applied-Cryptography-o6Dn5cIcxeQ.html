we want to deal with mutually
distrusting parties will call this
protocol - and in this protocol Alice
will start by doing three things she'll
pick a value for X there are two
possible values 0 and 1 we can think of
zeros representing heads and one
representing tails she'll also pick some
key of 110 so this is going to be a
random key and n is a security parameter
the higher the value of n the larger
space of possible keys the more secure
the protocol will be let's assume we're
gonna use AES and we'll make n 128 and
then Alice will compute a message which
is the result of encrypting using the
key the value of x and she will send to
Bob the value of M Bob receives the
value of M we'll keep track of it and
picks a guess so Bob will generate
however he wants a guess value that's
either 0 or 1 that's like calling the
coin toss and Bob will send that guess
back to Alice Alice knows the values
that she picked for X K and M as well as
the value Bob takfir the guess at this
point Alice sends the key to Bob and Bob
can compute the result of decrypting
with the key the message this is the
message that Alice sent to Bob in step 1
and at this stage Bob can check whether
or not he won the coin toss comparing
the value of T with the value of his
guests if they're equal that means Bob
guessed correctly and Alice should
charge the robo-dog if they're not equal
then it's up to Bob to charge the roadog
Alice needs to know the winner - and she
could do that she can easily do that by
checking if the guess is equal to X she
could also do the decryption because she
has the key as well so at the end of the
protocol both participants agree on the
result of the coin toss now the question
is is this fair so the question is how
hard is it for Alice to cheat using
robo-dog protocol - and by cheat here we
mean gain an advantage be able to make
the
coin toss unfair in her favor here's the
choices there's only one correct answer
it's the easiest thing for Alice to do
that would be enough to make the coin
toss unfair for Bob</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
