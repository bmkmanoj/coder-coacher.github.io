way that I try to be very specific about
what I'm adding because of course you
could have a redesign of an application
that has a number of things but I think
it's important to focus on one item at a
time so if you're adding an image to a
view or you're adding several buttons or
a layout it's good to accomplish those
individual pieces first and then kind of
just get something that works and then
evolve that over time the general thing
I'm trying to avoid is you can get into
a rabbit hole of like everything needs
to be refactored and you or factor one
thing and you start to pull other
threads because you to change something
else and then at the end of day you
don't have anything done so it's
important to stay very focused on
improving one area of the codebase and
then just finishing that even if there's
things that you kind of use a
scaffolding like you know it's going to
tear down later as you improve other
features that's okay it's okay to like
tear that out later but it's a it's good
to just focus on that one item when I
plan out implementing new features it
depends on how large that feature is if
it's a large feature then I'll generally
do some amount of project planning like
you will say okay well this might take
many weeks so I'll schedule it into
sprints and like start to get an idea of
what I'll tackle for those weeks if it's
smaller item I kind of do that in my
head I'll say I knew I need to do this
one activity first and then transition
to this other one and kind of build
those over time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
