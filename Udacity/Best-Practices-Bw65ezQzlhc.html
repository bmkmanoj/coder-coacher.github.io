handle disagreements around best
practice do the thing that the other
person wants to do first that's always a
good way right feels inclusive it's
going to feel terrible to you because
you're going to feel like you know the
right thing it's going to feel awesome
to them because they're going to feel
like there's some trust and willingness
that's one way to go about it may be an
easier way to think about this is that
there's no such thing as best practice
there are good practices that are
context bound as a matter of fact the
things that you are going to see that
cause pain inside of an organization or
that that make that make the the
interactions between the development
staff and the operations staff difficult
those are actually the result of earlier
best practices so a thing that we need
to be very very clear about is that
there's only good practices and those
good practices have a lifespan and so
when you walk in the first thing you
want to do is you want to develop that
sense of appreciative inquiry it's not
oh man how did it get like this it's oh
I wonder how it got this way what was
the value that that drove the
organization what value were they
chasing what things did they see is
being amazing that brought them to this
place and how do we recapture that the
things that we think are valuable it's
very very easy to declare the thing bad
and then to want to describe some new
good state and this is often how best
practices work I cannot tell you how
many times I've shown up on a site to
talk with with with some executives or
where the team and the first thing they
want to know is Jeff give me the
checklist of all the all the best
practices and in fact I can't do that
even even if I wanted to and often i do
want to because it feels like they would
be super happy if i could give it to
them i know that it's a little bit of a
fib that in fact what's going to have to
happen is the organization is going to
have to work together to find a set of
tooling that set of tooling is different
contextually from place to place
different vendors take different
approaches to the problem domain and
some work better in some contexts and
others in others and I think your job in
the role of devops engineer is to really
to help to help the organization to
discover the right set of tooling what
what what no organization needs right
now is another voice in like the war on
which tool is best it's an easy easy
trap for a junior engineer to fall into
I would encourage you at the beginning
of your learning process to avoid it
avoid it first of all learn all the
tools there are differences there are
differences in approach and technique
that are super valuable and you never
know when you're going to need that sort
of super special screwdriver to solve
that particular problem so as a new
engineer working in the devops face
you're going to come into an
organization and often you're going to
come in with it with a list of like
these are all this is these are all the
best practices these are the best tools
and you know be great if you just land
it in a place where everyone agreed but
in fact what it probably is going to
happen is you're going to land into a
place where people are already in sort
of violent disagreement and if what you
bring is that Abbott is more advocacy
you're never going to get to the place
that you want to get which is the the
ability to unlock that value so is it
new develops engineer in an organization
that's sort of can't find its way toward
a toolset I think taking the stance of
advocacy for any particular tool is not
going to be the place where when you're
bringing value the most valuable stance
you can take is the one in which you
help the organization to kind of co
discover what works in its context</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
