solution let's talk about some previous
attempts made to calculate the
circumference of the earth one famous
thinker Plato estimated the Earth's
circumference at 400,000 stadia what's a
stadia well today is a unit that the
Greeks used and it's a unit of length
and in physics will often be using
different units it's not something we
should be intimidated by and actually we
don't even know what the Greeks meant
when they said one stadium or two stadia
but our best guess is that one stadium
is about equal to 185 meters which is a
more familiar unit and one that will be
using frequently in this class so let's
convert this number 400,000 stadia into
a better unit maybe kilometers now one
way to do that is to start by writing
out what we were given we know we have a
number 400,000 stadia and I'm being
careful to write the unit's because the
unit's are pretty relevant here I'm
going to write this as over 1 because I
can always do that without changing the
number I'm then going to multiply this
by a conversion factor the conversion
factor that I chose is the one I know
that 185 meters is equal to 1 stadia so
the interesting thing about this is that
stadia appears here and it appears here
numerator and denominator so we can
cancel we now have a number that's
represented as meters 400,000 times 185
meters but that's not exactly what I
want either so we'll need to use another
conversion factor and since I know that
there are 1,000 meters in one kilometer
I can write this conversion factor
notice that I put meters in the
denominator so that it will cancel with
a meters in the numerator over here so
we can see all of the units have
cancelled all I'm left with are
kilometers and to carry out this
calculation I do 400,000 times 185 times
1 over 1,000 and that gives me a result
of 74,000 kilometers now the true
circumference and this is the number you
get if you type into a search engine the
question what is the circumference of
the earth it's 40,000 kilometers Plato
what's wrong
but how wrong was Plato how far off was
he there is something we often want to
talk about in physics but how do we do
it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
