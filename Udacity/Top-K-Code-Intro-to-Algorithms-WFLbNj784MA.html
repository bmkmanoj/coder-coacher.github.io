modify partition a little bit so that
instead of actually just building a list
for us it actually separates it out into
into three chunks the ones that are
smaller than B the chunk that is V and
the ones that are bigger than V alright
so given this modification to partition
we can run top K as follows we're given
a list and some number K that we want
the the smallest K elements of L we
start off by choosing a random element
of L so we just choose something random
in the range of the length of L and call
that V then we do a partition of L on V
and separate it into the left middle and
the right if the size of the thing on
the left is exactly K we're done we the
thing on the left is what we want
actually we can I didn't talk about this
before but if the length of the thing on
the left plus 1 is equal to k then we
still know the answer because it's the
stuff on the left and including v
alright so the it gets trickier when the
stuff on the left is bigger than K well
we went looking for the top K but we
just found something more than the top K
so we have to whittle it down further
and we can do that just by calling top k
on only the elements on the left and we
just want the K best elements on the
left so we've made some progress but we
haven't completely solved the problem
yet and finally in the last case the
length of left is smaller than K so we
know that everything on the left is
something that we want it's part of the
top K and we know V is V itself is also
part of the top K but we need to search
for the rest so and all the rest of the
ones that we want are on the right so
we're going to search through the list
on the right and how many do we things
do we want off the right well we wanted
k but we found length of left plus one
already so we can just subtract that off
from the number that we want call top k
recursively and we're done so we call
print top k of l5 and we get back five
elements not sorted but these are
exactly the five smallest elements of L
so it did the work</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
