end of this unit and we've covered quite
a bit here you've learned about breaking
programs into modules and how this can
make it easier to manage complexity and
learning how to manage complexity is one
of the most important perhaps the most
important skill that you can develop as
a programmer and there are lots of tools
for this one is modules the other one
that we've learned about this class is
defining your own types by using classes
you'll use some of these ideas in the
problem set to make some improvements to
the search engine code they won't change
the behavior of the search engine but
they'll make it easier to modify and
make it easier to understand and break
into pieces if you're paying really
close attention you might be curious
what's going on with these magic in it
and magic str methods before we define
them because you'll note when we tried
to print out a restaurant object we
didn't get an error we got something
just not something very useful and we
also were able to initialize these
objects before we defined in it so there
was something there already we didn't
get an error about an undefined
attribute because something was there
what strange is but we didn't actually
create anything explicitly that was
there what we'll do next class is
explained what was there and understand
how the idea of inheritance will allow
us to build lots and lots of classes
reusing code from previous classes hope
to see you there for the next unit</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
