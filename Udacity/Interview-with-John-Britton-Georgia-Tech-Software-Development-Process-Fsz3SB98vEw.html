the ice on version control systems and
get and some other related concept was
to interview John Britton who works with
github so let's go and see what John has
to say about git about version control
systems in general and about github John
is in Taipei
that's correct okay so we really you
know we couldn't go there so we're
interviewing people mostly and I won't
just want to thank you so much John for
agreeing to talk to us thank you very
much for having me with my pleasure and
I'm just gonna ask a few general
questions to John since is an expert on
on git and github and John is the
developer and community builder is
active in both the open source and the
open education areas and as an education
liaison acute haba is working to improve
computer science education by bringing
the principles of open source into the
classroom and I'm going to start with a
very general question which is what is a
version control system so a version
control system is a tool that software
developers use anybody who's doing
working with digital assets digital
projects can also use for keeping track
of you know revisions of your project
and when I say revisions I mean
essentially snapshots of your project
over time so you can imagine doing some
work and then every so often be it every
couple hours every couple days saving a
permanent snapshot of your project
because what why is it useful me I
understand the fact they know it's nice
to take a snapshot of your project but
would you do with the snapshot
afterwards so I think the most
immediately obvious benefits to having
snapshots of your projects to keeping
revisions is that you can go back if
you've ever worked on a project and
gotten to a point where you've solved a
bunch of your problems and there's just
one more step to do and you start
working on trying to solve that last
step and you break things you make it
you make it worse than it was you know
an hour ago at that point it's easier to
just go back to what you had then trying
to figure out what you what you broke so
you can always go back in time and then
the other big one is being able to
collaborate with multiple people so it's
pretty seldom these days that you work
on a production totally on your own it's
most common to work in you know in teams
and small groups so using a revision
control system allow
to collaborate with other people and
make sure that you don't step on each
other's toes as you're working that's
great because those are exactly some of
the topics that we're gonna cover in the
last son and so since we're gonna talk
about a specific version control system
which is git and you're definitely an
expert in in geta so what would you say
is a specific is special about git what
characterizes it in and how it does it
compare to other version control systems
so if any of you have used version
control systems before you may have
heard of something like subversion CVS
or maybe a commercial solution like
perforce I think the main important
characteristics of get our first it's
open source and the second that it's a
distributed version control system so
what that means a distributed version
control system is essentially a system
for tracking revisions of your software
that doesn't have any central repository
so the biggest characteristic is that I
can do my work and you can also work on
the same project at the same time
without communicating with each other
and without communicating to a central
central system ok great and so now that
we saw what it is what is github and how
does does it fit into this picture of
the distributed vision conversion
control system so github is the world's
largest code host and we essentially
have a website where you can collaborate
with people when you're writing code
there's two ways you can use github you
can use it publicly for open source and
you can use it in private within your
team or your company or within your
class and github started out just as a
way to host your your git repositories
but exactly grown into quite a bit more
it's an entire collaboration system
around around your code how many users
view I would say that we're approaching
5 million I don't know the exact number
we're definitely more than 4 million
right now but yeah I'd say somewhere
somewhere close to between 4 and 5
million so that's a lot of space I guess
terabytes of the of this space I would
imagine there are a lot of git
repositories on on our servers some
pedis Rosie
I guess that the when talking about
github there's there's one thing that
you kind of can't leave out and that's a
feature that's called a polar
so when you're using github you can
share your git repository do some work
and actually do do a code review of
proposed changes which is what we call
we call a pull request on github com
so essentially what it lets you do is
have a discussion about a set of
proposed changes and leave feedback in
line with the code so you could say for
example this method needs to be
refactored or you know I think I found
it off by one error here or you know
different kinds of feedback so that
before you totally integrate some
proposed changes you have kind of a
conversation about put your code and I
think that's really valuable when you're
working in a team
thank you John that was very informative
and thanks again for taking the time to
talk to us no problem thanks for having
me Oh talk to you soon let's thank again
John for enlightening us on some aspects
of version control systems gate and
github and now let's go over some of the
topics that we discussed with John to
recap them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
