printer HP one that is Bob wants to send
a print job to the printer HP one his
localhost sends a ticket granting
service request to the KDC the request
contains the ticket granting ticket and
an Authenticator which is the current
timestamp encrypted using buffs per day
session key SB when the KDC gets the
request it can decrypt the TGT and it
knows that it is a valid TGT because
only the KDC has the key to properly
encrypt the ID of bob contained in the
TGT it then uses the key SB containing
TGT to verify the Authenticator by
decrypting it and checking the timestamp
is current this proof that the sender is
pop because only bob has the key SB that
can encrypt the current timestamp
properly the KDC then generates a ticket
for Bob to communicate with the printer
let's stick it contains a session key
kbp and buffs ID and is encrypted using
the printers master key note that a
network device such as a printer has a
long and random master key this
configured in and is typically how to
guess or crack therefore the tickets for
these devices are encrypted using their
master keys the KDC sends the ticket
granting service response to buffs
localhost it contains the session key
kbp the idea of Bob and a ticket to the
printer and it is encrypted using
buffered a key s be there for only buffs
local workstation can decrypt this and
verify that it is from the KDC because
only the KDC can decrypt the idea of Bob
correctly with the key SP because the
key SP is embedded in TGT and only the
KDC can decrypt the TGT then Bob's local
host can authenticate itself to the
printer it can send a message to the
printer containing the ticket the
authentication request contains the
ticket and a Authenticator the
Authenticator is the server text of the
current timestamp encrypted using a
shear key the Tim Bob so co-host and
printer when the printer gets the ticket
it can decrypt the ticket using his
master key shared with the KDC because
the ticket was created but KDC and it
was encrypted using a shared key between
the printer and a KDC that is the
printer can verify that the kbp was
created by the KDC to communicate with
bob's local host the print server can
then use kbp to verify the authenticator
but they cooked ain't the ciphertext and
verifying that the result matches with
the current timestamp it then sends a
response to authenticate itself by say
adding one to the current timestamp and
encrypt it using the shear key the team
pops localhost and a printer and after
these authentication steps then Bob's
local host can send a print job to the
printer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
