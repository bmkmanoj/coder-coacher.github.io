Google self-driving car localization
even though you might not quite know it
yet so let me tell you where we are we
talked about measurement updates and we
talked about motion and we code these
two routine sends and move now
localization is nothing else but the
iteration of sends and move there's an
initial belief that is tossed into this
loop if you sends first to come to the
left side and then localization cycles
through these move sends move sends move
sends move sends move sent cycle and
every time the robot moves it loses
information register where is that's
because what motion is inaccurate and
every time it senses its gains
information that is manifest by the fact
that after motion the probability
distribution is a little bit flatter and
a bit more spread out and after sensing
it's focused a little bit more in fact
as a footnote there's a measure of
information could entropy and here's one
of the many ways you can write it is the
expected lock likelihood of the
probability of each grid cell and
without going to detail this is a
measure of information that the
distribution has and it can be shown
that the update step the motion step
makes the entropy go down and the
measurement step makes me go up so
you're really losing and gaining
information I would now love to
implement this in our code so in
addition to the two measurements we had
before red and green I'm going to give
you two motions one and one which means
the word moves right and right again can
you compute the pursue distribution a
through what first sends this red then
moves right by one then sends the screen
then moves right again and let's start
with a uniform prior distribution</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
