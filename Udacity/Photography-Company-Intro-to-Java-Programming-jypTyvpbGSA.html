with there's a manager and photographers
assignments and a portfolio or maybe
multiple portfolios manager is
responsible for labeling or prioritizing
and photographers are completing
assignments so I think the manager has a
method something like prioritize and
assign that takes in a new assignment
and figures out what to do with it and
photographers probably have a method
complete assignment thinking about the
methods that an assignment has might be
a little harder mostly an assignment
should have a priority and a description
so it'll probably be possible to set the
priority of an assignment will also
probably need to be able to get the
priorities or compare them so that the
manager can figure out which ones are
the highest priority assignments maybe
when an assignment is finished something
happens with it the portfolio probably
needs to be able to collect the finished
assignments and there should be a way to
look at the finished assignments as well
there are other things that you could
have written here it's possible that
customer would also be a good class or
maybe priority this would depend on how
complicated you wanted to make your
priorities</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
