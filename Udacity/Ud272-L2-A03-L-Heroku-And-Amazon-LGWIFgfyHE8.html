on an infrastructure the infrastructure
that Heroku uses as of the making of
this course is provided by Amazon Web
Services also known as AWS wait amazon
amazon yeah amazon has a whole line of
online services for developers and
online businesses amazon owns the
services that are housing and running
your code broke rents these servers from
amazon and configures them for your
deployment this makes it easy for her
ogre to focus on the add-ons that make
their product special hiroko doesn't
have to worry about making sure the
hardware works or is kept up to high
standards that's amazon now servers are
often organized in racks you can think
of these server racks as computers stack
together turning them into one big
powerful computer if you happen to be
building an application with millions of
users all over the world with intense
hardware requirements you might need the
entire server or many servers however
most web applications do not need
supercomputers there for an entire
server would be overkill this is why
Heroku partitions the Amazon servers
into smaller virtual servers that each
can house an application this makes it
so that Heroku can rent out a very small
piece of a server for a very low price
and often for free</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
