denial-of-service activity using a
technique called backscatter the idea
behind back scatter is that when an
attacker spoofs a source IP address say
on a tcp syn flood attack that the
replies to that initial tcp syn from the
victim will go to the location of the
source IP address these replies to
forged attack messages are called
back scatter now the interesting thing
about back scatter is that if we can
assume that these source IP addresses
are selected by the attacker at random
then we could set up a portion of the
network where we could monitor this back
scatter traffic coming back as syn ack
replies to forged source IP addresses if
we assume that these source IP addresses
are picked uniformly at random then the
amount of traffic that we see as back
scatter represents exactly a fraction
that's proportional to the size of the
overall attack so for example if we
monitor an IP addresses and we see M
attack packets then we expect to see
here n over 2 to the 32 of the total
back scatter packets and hence of the
total attack rate if we want to compute
the total attack rate we simply invert
this fraction so for example in this
case if our telescope were a slash 8 or
2 to the 24th IP addresses we would
simply multiply our observed attack rate
X by 2 to the 32 divided by 2 to the
24th or 255</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
