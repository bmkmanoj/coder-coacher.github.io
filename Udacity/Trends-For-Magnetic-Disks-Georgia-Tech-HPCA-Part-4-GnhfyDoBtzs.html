magnetic disks over the years the
capacity of magnetic disks how much data
fits on a single disk has actually been
improving exponentially at the rate of
about two per one or two years for a
while so things are getting better we
get more and more data per magnetic disk
the seek time has consistently been 5 to
10 milliseconds over a number of years
with very slow improvement the only
things that really improved the seek
time is if we either make a faster motor
that can still move the head assembly
very precisely which is very hard to do
or if we make the platter smaller so
that we Traverse a smaller distance so
there has been some recent improvement
in that we have gone from five inch
diameter disks to three and a half to
more recently two and a half and even
smaller so there has been some
improvement in seek time mainly because
the disks have shrunk the speed of
rotation for discs has actually been
improving it went from 5,000 rotations
per minute to 10,000 rotations per
minute and even beyond that so that part
of the magnetic disk speed has been
improving so this type of improvement
requires improvement in what material is
the platter built out of another factor
that has been affecting this is the
noise discs that rotate faster tend to
be both noisier and also create a hard
pitch sound which is less pleasant for
people and this type of improvement is
also relatively slow and the speed of
disk controllers and the buses over
which we transfer data has been
improving at an Okie rate so really the
controller and the bus are becoming a
smaller and smaller fraction of the
overall disk access time so the disk
access time is pretty much dominated by
the seek time and to a lesser extent now
the rotational latency and now you can
see why disks have been lagging
in improving their latency relative to
memory processors this is because seek
time requires better mechanics and
rotational latency also requires better
materials and better mechanical
properties both of which are not really
subject to something like Moore's law
that we get for processors</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
