expression like MX plus B I want to make
sure that i parse that as if m + XR
together and not X and B are together
and another way to say that is I want to
see any expression as if it were the
sequence of something plus something
else plus something else these pluses
can also be minus signs but anything
with the time sign I want to have that
all be within the dot dot dot rather
than encompassing a plus sign in it and
so what I want to do is write a grammar
that defines the language of these
expressions so a grammar is a
description its finite in length and it
should be easy to write and a language
is a set of all possible strings that
that grammar describes and I want to be
able to say that in a concise language
maybe something like saying I'm going to
define expressions and I want to define
the expression as something that looks
like this and I need a name for the dots
so let's call that a term so an
expression can be a term minus or a plus
and let's use to a regular expression
notation to describe a plus or minus and
then more terms but I can just say
recursively that that's an expression
and that will give me any number of
terms with loss and minuses in between
them so that's one possibility but
that's recursive and I need a base case
so i can say it can also be the case
that an expression can consist of a
single term a plus b is is an expression
a plus B plus C is an expression and
also just a that's the rule for
expression then I would write the rule
for term it would be similar it would
take into account the multiply and
divide and I would write the rest of the
grammar in this format and notice here
I've just sort of made up I've used
wishful thinking to say i wish i had a
notation like this to describe what the
grammar is</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
