question and it's kind of strange that a
discipline like computer science is so
poorly defined that if you ask many
computer scientists what it is you'll
get very different answers but my answer
to this is it is engineering it is a
science and it's also a liberal art that
all three are true and I'll explain why
next so this is why I tend to think
about engineering that's building big
complex structures that solve physical
problems like getting cars across they
of water with that narrow view of
building physical things well most of
what we do in computing is not about
building physical things it's about
building virtual things it's about
solving problems a broader view of
engineering use it as design under
constraint when you're building a bridge
to constraint sort of the laws of
physics you need the bridge to stand up
but you want to limit the cost of the
bridge the amount of material that you
use you want it to not sway too much in
the wind these are all the kinds of
constraints that you have to think about
in designing a bridge when we build
computer programs we don't usually have
to worry too much about the laws of
physics we've seen that they do affect
us that the speed it takes for light to
travel affects how fast our programs
will run but for the most part when
we're designing programs this is not the
main thing that we're thinking about the
main constraint that we have to worry
about is the limitations of human minds
what we can do is limited by our
creativity but it's also limited by how
much we can keep in mind at one time the
main tool that we have to solve this is
abstraction the point of abstraction is
to allow us to limit what we have to
keep in our mind to be able to solve
problems by hiding those details and
thinking about things at the right level
and designing programs in a way that we
can have a procedure that solves the
problems that we want and then we can
forget about the details of what we move
on to the next part well that's all
about using abstraction to overcome the
limits of human minds in terms of how
much we can keep in mind and understand
at one time so from that perspective
computer science is definitely about
engineering we certainly want to build
things we're not building things like
bridges and we're doing that under
constraints but the main constraints are
not from the laws of physics because
we're not building physical things but
from the limits of our own minds so we
tend to think about science as
understanding nature through observation
and our favorite example of this is
Sir Isaac Newton if you can't recognize
this this is obviously Newton because
he's sitting under an apple tree and the
probably untrue story of him
understanding gravity because of an
Apple falling on his head in computer
science we're mostly not focused on
understanding nature at least not in a
very direct way we're thinking about
abstract things we're writing programs
to solve problems but they're dealing
with abstract representations of those
problems certainly computing is used all
over the place to build better models of
the universe and to test those models
but that's a little different from
saying that computer science itself is a
science but there's a lot of computing
in nature certainly physical processes
involve computation the other big
example today is really in biology if
you think about DNA as programming
organisms it's a very complex way of
programming but it's also very
computational and if you think about
biology biology is really all about
computation today so certainly if we
want to understand nature better both
how human minds work well that's largely
about computation and how DNA produces
biological organisms and how DNA evolves
over time that's really about
understanding computation in nature and
we didn't get to this too much in this
class but this question about
universality questions about what can be
computed and how fast it can be computed
are really fundamental questions about
science they're questions about our
universe they're abstract questions in
the sense that we can form them as
mathematical precise questions but they
are also really questioned about what
are the limits and what are the
possibilities in our universe the final
correct answer was liberal art and in
some sense this is arguably the easiest
one to defend but it's probably the one
that was most surprising to many of you
and understanding why computer science
is a liberal art depends on actually
understanding what the liberal arts are
and here's a picture of the medieval
view of the liberal arts
there's grammar rhetoric dialect which
we would think of as logic today those
are the three that have to do with
language and then therefore that have to
do with number the four that have to do
with number our arithmetic
geometry music which is number in time
and astronomy which is number in time
and space so how do each of those relate
to computing well we certainly seen a
lot with grammars we've seen rules like
this rhetoric is about using language to
communicate between people especially to
persuade people well we've actually seen
rhetoric a little bit this is a little
less clear but we've seen that in terms
of network protocols what protocols are
our ways of computers communicating with
each other and making sure that they can
understand each other
so are you belief that's a form of
rhetoric logic is the art of thinking in
the medieval view we've certainly used
logic all over the place in this class
all of our decision constructs are
logical constructs so we've certainly
used a lot of logic so those are the
three traditional liberal arts known as
the Trivium focused on language and then
we have the quadrivium which are the
four focused on numbers arithmetic we've
certainly seen lots of earth music in
this class and we can do lots of
arithmetic and python geometry we
haven't used too much directly in this
class there certainly is lots of use of
geometry in computing the two that I'll
mention most in computer graphics that's
all about understanding the geometry of
light well enough to be able to simulate
images and they'd be able to draw things
on the screen the other place where
geometry comes up a lot is in networking
and we saw that a little bit in unit 4
if we want to design a network we care
about the topology of the network how
things are connected and that depends on
understanding geometry but we didn't get
to either those things too much in this
class music which is about number in
time and we haven't really seen how
computing relates to music very much in
this class but certainly recursion
occurs all over the place in music if
you don't believe me I would encourage
you to read this book by Douglas
Hofstadter called gödel Escher Bach and
it's all about how the logic of
computing relates two things in both the
art of Usher and the music of Bach and
the final traditional liberal art was
astronomy we haven't seen that directly
in this class either but certainly
almost all astronomy today depends on
computer
