let's have a reminder of what a branch
does in a pipeline a branch instruction
like this will compare registers r1 and
r2 and if they are equal jump to the
label this is usually implemented by
having in the immediate part of the
instruction field the difference between
the next instructions PC and the PC that
should be at the label so that the
branch effectively if r1 and r2 are
equal
we'll just add the immediate operand to
its current PC so that the branch if r1
and r2 are equal
we'll add the immediate operand to the
PC that it computed for the next
instruction now the problem with
branches is that if the branch condition
is not met just increment the PC for
example if the size of the branch
instruction is 4 then the PC will just
move by 4 bytes however if the branch
condition is satisfied in this case if
r2 and r1 are equal then the branch will
increment the PC and also add the
immediate to it so the next instruction
we fetch will be at this label now let's
look at what happens when a branch goes
through a pipeline let's say we have our
classical pipeline with a fetch read ALU
memory and write stages and let's say
that towards the end of the ALU stage we
actually figure out if a branch is taken
or not in the first cycle we fetch this
branch in the second cycle the branch
moves here where it reads the operands
so it's reading r1 and r2 but we have no
chance of telling whether the branch
will be taken or not so we either don't
fetch anything here or we fetch
something here let's say we fetch some
sort of a green instruction here at the
end of this cycle we still don't know
whether the branch will be taken we have
now read r1 and r2 but we haven't
compared them yet so when the branch is
in the ALU stage the green instruction
we have fetched after the branch moves
here and we fetch another instruction
let's say that's a purple instruction at
the end of this cycle we finally know
whether the branch is taken now there
are two possibilities either we have
fetched the correct instructions for
example the branch is not-taken and we
have
taken the instructions that follow the
branch the branch is not-taken that
means the PC just gets incremented and
we fetch the right instructions in which
case we have no bubble in our pipeline
we can just proceed we fetch the right
instructions the second possibility is
that the branch for example is taken and
we fetched the next instructions in
which case we have to cancel these
instructions in the next cycle these two
canceled instructions move on through
the pipeline and we finally fetch the
instruction that we know is correctly
fetched so what happens is if we
correctly guessed what should be fetched
after the branch then there is no
penalty the branch finishes and then the
next instruction will finish right after
the branch however if we miss predicted
what will happen during the branch and
we fetch the wrong things then the
branch effectively took three cycles to
execute because the branch actually
finishes in one cycle but then there are
two empty cycles when we don't finish
anything
so overall the cost of the branch was
really three cycles instead of one in
our pipeline meaning the branch cost us
one cycle which is normal for every
instruction plus two cycles because of a
misprediction now you also see why it
never pays to not fetch something after
the branch if we don't fetch anything
after the branch until we are sure what
to fetch then we are guaranteed to have
two empty slots after the branch so
somehow in that case regardless of
whether we would have guessed correctly
or not we have a two cycle penalty so
we'd rather have the two cycle penalty
some of the time then all of the time
another thing that is important to note
is that at the end of the fetch cycle
where we fetch the branch we don't
really know anything about this
instruction yet we have just obtained
the instruction word meaning the four
bytes that represent an instruction but
we haven't even begun decoding the
branch so what happens is next cycle we
have to fetch something based only on
the knowledge of the branch address we
don't even know whether it's a branch or
not so when we are fetching an
instruction we don't even know it is a
branch but we already have to make a
prediction of whether it's a taken
branch</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
