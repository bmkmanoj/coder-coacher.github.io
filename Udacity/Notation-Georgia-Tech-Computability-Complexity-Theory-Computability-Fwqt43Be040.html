Turing machine we turn to the task of
establishing some notation for a
mathematical model here have used a
diagram to represent the Turing machine
in its configuration we have the tape
the read/write head which is connected
to the state transition logic and a
little despite here that will indicate
the halt state that is the internal
state of the Turing machine when it
stops mathematically a Turing machine
consists of a finite set of states q
everything used to specify a Turing
machine is finite by the way that's
critically important next we need to
specify an input alphabet of allowed
symbols this must not include the blank
symbol which we will notate with this
square cut most of the time for some of
the quizzes where we need you to be able
to type the character we will use B we
can't allow the input alphabet to
include the blank symbol or we wouldn't
be able to tell where the input string
ended the whole rest of the tape where
the input string is not written by the
way has blanks on it we also defined the
tape alphabet of symbols and that's the
set of symbols that the read/write head
can use and this will include the blank
symbol a Turing machine also specifies a
transition function from a state tape
symbol pair to a state tape symbol
direction triple this of course tells
the machine what to do for every
possible current state and symbol that
could be read we have the appropriate
response the new state to move to the
symbol to write to the tape you can make
this the same as the input one to leave
the tape alone and the direction to move
the head relative to the tape note that
we can always move the head to the right
but if the head is currently over the
first position of the tape then we can't
actually move left when the transition
function says that the machine should
move the head left then we just have it
stay in the same position by convention
a Turing machine also specifies a start
state the Machine always starts in the
first position on the tape and in this
state and finally we have an accept and
a reject state when these are reached
the Machine halts its execution and
displays the final state at first all
notation may seem overwhelming it is a
seven to poll after all remember however
that all the machine ever does is
respond to the current symbol it sees
based on its current state thus it's the
transition function that is at the heart
of the machine and most all of the
important information like the set of
states and the tape alphabet is implicit
in it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
