four-week collision resistance and four
week collision resistance our assumption
and attacker needs to do about 2 to the
B work where B is the number of hash
bits to have a good chance of finding a
collision strong collision resistance is
harder than a week to obtain strong
collision resistance is actually much
harder and we'll see that we need about
twice as many bits for that that
attackers effort is more like 2 to the B
over 2 so we'll need about twice as many
output bits in our hash function to
provide this the reason for this is
because of what's known as the birthday
paradox it's called the paradox it's not
really a paradox it's a surprise to
people who don't follow the mathematics
on this but there's nothing paradoxical
about it it's not like the berry paradox
that leads took into contradiction and
the way this is usually framed is you
have some group of K people let's say
it's a kindergarten classroom and you
want to know what the probability that
two people have the same birthday and
the reason this is called the paradox is
the answer is actually much higher than
most people expect so let's compute this
we'll assume that they're no leap years
and that birthdays are uniformly
distributed we assume the same property
for our outputs of our ideal hash
function so we'll compute the complement
probability that there are no duplicates
and then the probability that there is
at least one duplicate is one minus this
and the way to think about that is well
we can go through the people in the
class we can assign some birthday to
each one so we'll assign b0 to the first
one b1 to the second one keep assigning
birthdays there are lots of different
ways we could do that in order to assign
birthdays with no duplicates then
there's a limited number of ways that we
can pick any of 365 days for the first
birthday for the second one if we want
no duplicates we can't use whatever day
we pick for the first one so be that
times 360 four times 363 and so forth
and that's the number of ways to assign
birthdays with no duplication we're
trying to compute the probability so
we're going to divide that by the number
of ways to assign with duplication which
is just 365
choices for each person so in general
this first value is n factorial divided
by n minus K factorial and the bottom
result is just end of decay and is the
number of possible days or the number of
possible hash outputs K is the number of
trials and so our probability that there
are duplicates is just 1 minus this this
is what we need for strong collision
resistance it's higher than what we
needed for weak collision resistance
which was 1 minus 1 minus 1 or n to the
K so to actually compute this these
numbers would get really big if we tried
to actually compute the factorials
instead we need to use approximations to
do this but to give you some idea what
the results are like if we have the
duplicate birthday question where we
have 365 days and 20 people the
probability that there's at least one
duplicate exceeds 0.4 if we're thinking
about hash collisions if we only had a
64-bit hash and our attacker was much
weaker than the one we had hypothesized
let's say they can only do to 232 that's
already almost a 40% chance of success
this success goes up quite quickly if
the attacker can do 2 to the 34 hashes
then the success probability is very
close to 1 so the conclusion is that
given an ideal hash function with n
possible outputs an attacker needs about
n guesses to find an input that hashes
to a particular value but only needs
about the square root of n guesses to
find a pair that collide this assumes
the attacker can store all those hash
values as they try the guesses and
compare it to all the previous ones and
this is the reason why hash functions
need to have large outputs sha-1 which
was a widely used hash function used 160
bits in its output this is actually
broken there's a way to find collisions
using sha-1 with only two to the 51
operations much fewer than the two to
the 80 that one would expect from the
square root estimate and that's because
of mathematical weaknesses in the way
sha-1 works shot
to the output can be either 256 or 512
bits as long as there aren't
mathematical weaknesses in the cipher if
it was really ideal hash function this
would be big enough to defeat any
realistic attacker but they're beginning
to be suggesting that there may be ways
to break this no practical breaks have
been found yet and sha-3 the winner is
expected to be announced later this year
so for the rest of this class we're
going to assume that we do have an ideal
hash function and that it has enough
outputs to provide strong collision
resistance against a motivated attacker</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
