the uses of metacognition we can use it
to fix errors in knowledge or reasoning
or learning we can use it to fix gaps
and knowledge reasoning or learning we
can use it for strategy integration one
thing that we have not yet talked about
is what is the process that
metacognition uses what is its strategy
well metacognition can use the same
kinds of reasoning processes that is the
self is reasoning over that is case
based reasoning is a potential strategy
for metacognition constraint propagation
is a potential strategy for
metacognition and so on let us take an
example supposedly at metacognition
comes across a problem and it must
select among these strategies
metacognition made ask itself what
strategy did I pick the last time I came
across a similar problem this is case
based reasoning at a meta-level to
complete this example metacognition
might say the last time i use constraint
propagation is a technique with this
particular problem this time I'll use
constraint propagation again as another
example given a second problem
metacognition may use planning to set up
a plan for using these various
strategies thinking on each of these
strategies as an operator as a third
example metacognition might get a new
problem and decide to use every single
method its disposal to generate a
possible solution it then might have
some heuristics to test each one of
those possible solutions and figure out
which one is best so then it's using
generate and test to select between its
multiple strategies to summarize this
part then metacognition can use these
same reasoning strategies that we have
been studying at the deliberative level</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
