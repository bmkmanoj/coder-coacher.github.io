into algorithms and talk about temporal
difference learning so why don't we just
sort of summarize this the philosophical
stuff that we we talked about just now
okay so what have we learned so I think
we learned a bunch of stuff but we
really learned three classes of things
we learned sort of what reinforcement
learning is alright that's one class of
things yeah and and as you wrote up
there we realized RL is about agents
interacting with environments and
getting rewards and sort of figure out
what the world is and by the way is a
part of that we learned just how
frustrating it is to actually do
reinforcement learning rather than just
solving an MDP I great that okay the
second thing we learned or we talked
about was the description of what policy
is and the different ways you might go
around solving these RL problems and
evaluating them what does it mean to
have a good policy wait and then the
third class of things that we learn was
about evaluating learners and we realize
that there are lots of different ways to
evaluate learners just like there's lots
of different ways to evaluate policies
and plans you can talk about truncating
them or doing things that are infinite
we can talk about whether a learner is
fast whether a learner is efficient in a
different sense like with sample
complexity whether it actually returns
good values you can think about it just
in terms of its output or how it got to
its output right and so we're going to
make some choices so that we have
concrete algorithms that we can present
and analyses that we can present but
it's worth keeping in mind that some of
these things are kind of arbitrary I
mean they're justified but there's other
things that would also be justified
that's what that seems fair in machine
learning alright well that all make
sense to me Michael so I guess we'll
continue this conversation next week
sounds good all right have a good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
