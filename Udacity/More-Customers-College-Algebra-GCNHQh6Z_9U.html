to equal the total amount of money that
grant can count on getting from his
friends after the second day of sales so
that needs to account for the money from
the people who bought on the first day
and the money from the people who bought
on the second day we already know from
this equation we came up with earlier
that'll make 36 w + 22 n dollars from
the initial batch of buyers so that
means the equation that we have down
here still needs to have these terms in
it a couple of these equations don't so
I'm going to cross them off our list
neither these answers includes the money
from the people who bought from grant on
the first day the other four answers
that are left over all have 36 w and 22
n as terms so that's great however this
first one only has 36 w + 22 n it
doesn't have any information having to
do with people who bought on the second
day so that can't be right since we know
that grant will make some money off of
that second round of buyers to pick
between these three remaining equations
we need to go through similar steps for
people who buy wipers and people who buy
nozzles as you did in some of the
earlier quizzes to figure out the terms
in this equation 48 old we know that the
price per wiper is still w and since 51
more people are going to buy wipers
we're going to need to add 51 w in in
our equation this choice doesn't have 51
w it has 50 w so it can't be right then
for the money he learn from these 25
extra people buying two nozzles each is
going to be equal to 25 times 2n since n
is the price per nozzle and they each by
two if we simplify 25 times 2n we
actually get 50 n so we also need to
have 50 n and our answer both of these
last two choices have 36 w and 22 n in
them and they also have 51 w + 50 n so
that means they are both correct the
only difference between them is the
order that the terms are arranged in
this is just another case of the
commutative property of addition awesome
job I know this was a really tough quiz
so great job for getting through it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
