variance since it corrects for the
different sample sizes and the problem
set you'll get more practice using the
pooled variance but the way the T
statistic is calculated is essentially
the same we divide the observed
difference between the mean of X and the
mean of Y by the standard error which is
calculated slightly differently where
these guys here are this pooled variance
note that this is the T statistic when
we expect that the true populations that
these samples come from are the same in
other words that the difference between
the population parameters is zero but
say we expect that the difference is
equal to 10 for example then here we
would subtract this expected difference
from the observed difference and this
observed difference is what we get from
our sample so this is our full T
statistic for independent samples but in
general in this class our null
hypothesis has been that there is no
significant difference between the two
populations in other words we expect
that the difference between the
parameters is about zero there are a few
assumptions to keep in mind when using
the pooled variance as there are with
any method of measurement
first of all x and y should be random
samples from two independent populations
remember when we looked at dependent
samples data coming from the same
subject twice in this case the
population should be independent the
second is that the populations that x
and y come from should be approximately
normal this is less important when the
sample sizes are very large greater than
30 a third assumption is that the sample
data can be used to estimate the
population variances and finally the
population variances should be roughly
equal allowing us to use this pooled
variance as an estimate of both</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
