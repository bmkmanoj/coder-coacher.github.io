can travel in one nanosecond if you know
what kind of processor you have and if
you have a map you can find this by
selecting from the Apple menu about this
Mac there'll be instructions on the
website how you can do this for other
operating systems but you'll see a
window like this appear that will tell
you what kind of processor you have and
if you zoom that a little bit you can
see that it says we have a 2.7 ghz intel
core processor
what GHz stands for is gigahertz which
means we can do 2.7 billion cycles in
each second so that means the time we
have for one cycle is actually less than
a nanosecond and you can think of a
cycle as the time the computer has to do
one step so it does one step 2.7 billion
times in a second that means the time
for each cycle is 1/2 point 7
nanoseconds so that means in the time
the computer has for one cycle light
travels eleven point one centimeters so
how far is that so let's have a little
scale here if we have a dollar bill
that's actually quite a bit longer than
eleven point one centimeters eleven
point one centimeters is about three
quarters of the way across the bill so
within the time light can travel that
distance the computers got to finish
processing one cycle finish at least
part of an instruction this should give
you some idea of how fast the computer
is operating and this is part of the
reason a processor has to be so small if
the processor was bigger than 11
centimeters we couldn't even send light
across the processor in the time for one
cycle</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
