extracting the first URL in a page and
see how we can turn that into a
procedure and remember we made many
copies of the same code if we wanted to
extract many links from the page what we
want to do now is take the part that we
kept having a copy figure out how to
turn that into a procedure so we wanted
to do is take this code so we're gonna
take all the code here I'm leaving this
part out of the procedure because that's
what we want to do with the results what
we want to do is take all this code and
turn it into our procedure that means
instead of having to do all this work
each time what we want is the procedure
that will start from what we have here
we have the page what we want to do is
from the page do a bunch of work get the
URL then we want to do some stuff for
the URL we want to do some stuff for the
page and then we're going to do it all
over again so our goal is to figure out
how to turn this part of the code into a
procedure so we could keep reusing that
each time instead of writing the same
code so we need a little more room so
let's shrink the code we had and now the
question is how are we going to make
that procedure so let's start with a
quiz when we think about making a
procedure the first thing we always want
to do is make sure that we understand
this we need to know what the inputs are
to that procedure we need to know what
the outputs are if we don't understand
the inputs and the outputs then there's
no hope of writing the procedure
correctly since the main purpose of the
procedure is to map the inputs into
outputs so let's see if you can figure
out what the inputs should be for the
procedure that we want to make to
replace this code and I'm going to give
you the procedure a name so the goal of
the procedure is to find the URL that's
the next link target in this page so
we'll call the procedure get next target
it's important to give good name sub
procedures that's how we remember what
they're supposed to do and we'll use the
name get next target so our question now
is in defining this procedure what
should its inputs be I'll give you some
choices so it simple could be a number
giving the position of the start of the
next link its input could be a number
giving the position of the start of the
next quote its input could be a string
giving the contents of the rest
web page and for the final choice we
could have two inputs the first a number
giving the position of the start of the
next link and the second a string giving
the contents of the page</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
