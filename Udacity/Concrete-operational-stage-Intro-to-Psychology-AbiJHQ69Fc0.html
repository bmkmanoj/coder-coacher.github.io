years from about 7:00 to 11:00 give or
take
children move into the third stage of
cognitive development according to
Piaget he called this stage the concrete
operational stage now we already defined
operation as the ability to figure
things out just in one's head so this is
the primary skill at this age one of the
best examples of this is how children at
this stage can do basic math just in
their head for example five plus five is
ten they no longer need to count add or
subtract using their fingers or other
objects conservation is now possible
because of the mental capability of
saying something like oh well those two
look different but I know that that's
really the same concrete refers to the
fact that children in this stage reason
and think about concrete things not
abstract ones abstract ideas in
reasoning happen in the next and final
stage of cognitive development formal
operations which begins in adolescence</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
