sophisticated algorithms I would like to
briefly tell you a little bit about a
technique known as brute force so what
does brute force mean does it mean that
we take a hammer and beat the answer out
of our computer of course not brute
force is the algorithm that Alice Bob
and Carol were using initially so you'll
remember for example that for Bob we
were using an algorithm like this or not
using but proposing an algorithm like
this at least that simply went through
all possible assignments of 0 &amp;amp; 1 to the
vertices or at that time we still call
them teens and the weakness of this
algorithm was that it had a pretty
unacceptable running time as soon as you
got to more than 20 or 30 vertices in
the network but this algorithm actually
also has two strengths one strength of
it is that it's very simple and the
other thing is that because it's so
simple you can actually also implement
it rather fast so under certain
conditions using an algorithm like this
actually might not be that bad an idea
and this method of using all possible
assignments so first of all we're not
going to use the hammer here this method
of going through all possible
assignments without any more
sophisticated techniques or
sophisticated algorithmic techniques is
known as brute force and so as I've just
explained to you there are certain
conditions for brute force is actually
desirable so let's have you figure out
what those conditions could be and by
brute force me we of course mean try all
possibilities could it be that when you
don't have much time to design and
program a more sophisticated algorithm
could it be when the instances or the
inputs for which you're trying to solve
your problem are small so say n the size
of the problem is smaller smaller than
20 or could it be when you need to solve
the problem only once and the input
might be a little bit bigger there so
for each one I'm going to give you two
choices whether under these conditions
using brute force could be okay and the
first one is it may be and the second
one is a definitive no I'm not going to
give you a clear yes choice because
obviously since we're dealing with
np-complete problems here brute force is
never generally advisable of course</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
