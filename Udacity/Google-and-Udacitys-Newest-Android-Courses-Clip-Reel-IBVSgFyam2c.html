yeah this is a variable it's a box
and you can put a value inside of it it
says int yeah int chance for integer
okay so you can put an integer or a
number inside of this box exactly and
you can even give it a name let's call
it number of cups of coffees ordered
okay barely fit okay okay so now we can
refer to this variable using this name
in the code instead of putting the value
two okay
and later we can also update it if you
want so let's put the value inside now
how we gonna do that well I have some
post-its let's call the number of cups
of coffees ordered to be two why only
two one for me and one for my friend
Katrin thank ya so now we have a
variable that is called number of
coffees ordered and it holds the value
two let's implement this in our code
well performance looks great on many
phone but this older phone performance
will don't say that word again what
performance and now you're back what if
you say performance three times he'll
just magically appear Ian joy no what
are we doing here at Udacity I thought
we already had a course on performance
so we do and that's why we actually
don't need you if it's an accident the
works just kind of fell out of his mouth
and we definitely don't need you to go
through any apps we don't really know
Gerry I told Jeremy hey Mark what's up
yeah I thought you're supposed to
release your Android app today what's
all this
oh I just gotta use a hand roids studio
wizard to generate my signed apk today
so I'm just doing my wizard ritual hope
it all works right a wizard yeah you
never really know what those build
Wizards are doing right so you just
gotta hope nothing goes wrong you know a
wizard isn't actually magic oh yeah well
how does it generate its magical keys
and magically spit out a signed apk
there's nothing magic about it the
Android studio can't do anything that
you can't do that from the command line
oh yeah yeah Android studio all it's
doing is telling Gradle to run some
tasks and those tasks are just using
regular command-line utilities so it's
not magic no and I don't have to wear
this robe to get it to work oh thank god
this is so hot Oh help me get this thing
off oh I never should have trusted that
centaur I met in a mystical forest I
shouldn't have made him fifty gold
pieces we're programming advice you're
probably familiar with many of the
services that are offered by Google and
if you develop applications your users
likely are too perhaps they need to find
a location or see what's interesting
nearby they're using Google Maps maybe
you want to monetize your apps so that
app usage is rewarded and your users
they don't have to pay upfront Google
ads is your friend as well as these
we've got lots of great api's for you
storing files on the cloud with Google
Drive accessing Google Analytics signing
into your application integrating with
Google fit and much much more in this
course you'll learn how to use these
services in your apps you'll see how
easily you have the power of Google and
your fingertips allowing you to build
better apps before you can get started
let's take a look at getting the tools
that you need you'll be building your
apps using Android studio which is
available at no cost to you and can be
downloaded
from developer.android.com if you want
some help in setting it up check out the
Android fundamentals course at the URL
