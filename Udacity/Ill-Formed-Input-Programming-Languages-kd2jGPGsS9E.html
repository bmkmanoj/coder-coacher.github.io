address is malformed HTML one of the
questions on the forums was are we going
to talk about mistakes in web pages what
if a real web developer forgets to close
off a tag or makes a sort of subtle
mistake in punctuation are we going to
talk about that in the web browser that
we built for this class and the answer
is yes in fact very prescient on your
part that's a very predictive question
we're going to get to it in unit 3
exactly the next unit we're going to
talk about recognizing malformed HTML
and JavaScript but in this class we're
mostly going to talk about recognizing
them and for the particular project that
we work on for our simple web browser if
the HTML is malformed we're not going to
do anything about it we just won't
render that part of the web page in
practice web browsers put a lot a huge
amount of effort into being very
forgiving they want to render as much
information as possible even if the web
page is out of date or written without
knowledge of the standards or in any
other way messed up and this approach of
sort of keeping going is sometimes known
as error recovery or error tolerance or
fault tolerance in unit 3 we're going to
talk about breaking up tokens and seeing
if they match a particular structure
seeing if in there and there in the
language of a formal grammar that
describes all of JavaScript or olive web
pages you know in the real world a lot
of web pages are not they don't match
the formal idealized grammar I've
written down on the walls of Plato's
cave similarly not every JavaScript
program adheres to exactly the same idea
of to pick a timely example where the
semicolons go after statements okay so
in practice what you'll often want to do
if you're doing commercial software if
you want to make your customers as happy
as possible by supporting everything
that they've written you'll write a
bunch of duplicate rules for example you
might write one regular expression that
accepts normal numbers but if people
make a common mistake when writing
numbers maybe they write multiple
multiple period signs or something like
that you might write another rule that
accepts those and maybe print out some
warning
but then does its best to figure out
what the value is and keeps going again
in real-world industrial software
development for web browser this sort of
error recovery when you're doing lexical
analysis or syntactic analysis is of
critical importance because the vast
majority of web pages are not standards
compliant in this class we're going to
tell you how to tell the difference
between good HTML and bad between
well-formed JavaScript and they'll form
JavaScript but I'm only going to require
that you deal with well-formed strings
once you know how to do it the good way
though you could do it for ill forum
strings you'd have all the tools after
finishing this class it would just be
more busy work elbow grease it would
take additional time and it wouldn't
really teach you more concepts that's
what I'm not going to focus on it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
