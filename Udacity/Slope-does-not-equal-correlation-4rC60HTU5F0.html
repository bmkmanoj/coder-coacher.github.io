is to confound slope and correlation in
other words if they find that the slope
of the line that fits the data is one
that the data are correlated and that's
not true the slope is just the slope
correlation is a measure of how tightly
do these individual points fit that line
so you could have a shallow slope but
the data tightly fitting that line and
thus a higher correlation or you could
have a steeper line and the data fitting
that line and a higher correlation
correlation is just a measure of how
tightly do those dots fit the line and
you can have a correlation from 0 to 1 0
meaning it's the data is not correlated
at all and 1 meaning it's very highly
correlated now we'll add a scatter plot
for another stock ABC and again each one
of these dots represents the daily
return of s py verses ABC and we fit a
line to it and it turns out it's got a
slope of 2 so now we're going to ask you
a couple questions about it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
