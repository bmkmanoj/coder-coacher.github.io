dynamics of the aggregate window as
shown in the upper part of the graph
would have the same dynamics as any
individual flow the quantities on the
y-axis here would simply be different
specifically the number of packets
occupying the buffer would be the sum of
all of the TCP flows Windows rather than
the window of any individual flow now if
there are only a small number of flows
in the network then these flows may tend
to stay synchronized and the aggregate
dynamics might mimic the dynamics of any
single flow as shown but as the network
supports an increasingly large number of
flows these individual TCP flows become
D synchronized so instead of all of the
flows lining up with the sawtooth as
shown in the bottom part individual
flows might see peaks at different times
as a result instead of seeing a huge
sawtooth that's the sum of a bunch of
synchronised flows the aggregate instead
might look quite a bit more smooth as a
result of the individual flows being
desynchronized
and we can represent this sum which is
the buffer occupancy as a random
variable at any given time it's going to
take a particular range of values the
range of values that this buffer
occupancy takes can actually be analyzed
in terms of the central limit theorem
the central limit theorem tells us that
the more variables that we have and in
this case the number of variables are
the number of unique congestion windows
of flows that we have the narrower the
Gaussian will be in this case the
Gaussian is the fluctuation of the sum
of all of the congestion windows in fact
the width decreases as 1 over root n
where n is the number of unique
congestion windows of flows that we have
and therefore instead of the required
buffering needing to be too
see we can get away with much less
buffering in particular two times C
divided by the square root of n where n
is the number of flows passing through
the router</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
