assignment for you
that'll kind of take you a while but I
would like you to implement a
multi-dimensional Kalman filter for the
example I've just given you the matrix
class is a class for manipulating
matrices that should make it really easy
it has a function the initializes
matrices actually an example in a second
you can set them down to zero it can
compute an identity matrix it can friend
out a matrix with show and then
overloads operators like addition
subtraction multiplication and even
computes the transpose of a matrix and
in some more extended code I can
actually invert a matrix using cholesky
factorization so as a function here
called inverse so this matrix class is
available it's a small version of what
is found in typical libraries and I want
to demonstrate it for you just for a
second you can make a matrix for the
command like this but the argument in
the parentheses is a two dimensional
matrix in this case it's a vertical
vector and with a show command you can
print out the result and vertical vector
you can put the transpose as follows if
you run this you find a horizontal
vector and say you wish to multiply a
matrix by vector then we can make a two
by two matrix with this innovation of a
year matrix of twelve eight and six two
you can print this matrix here it is
twelve eight six two these are these
values over here and we can multiply F&amp;amp;A
so here B equals F times a and if we
show the result we get the vector 280
that's obtained by ten times 12 plus ten
times eight is 200 times times 6 10 plus
10 times 2 is 80 so using my matrix
libraries I set an initial state this is
a tracking in 1d where the state is the
position
and the velocity I initialized both with
zero because I don't know the actual
location and the velocity i given
uncertainty matrix where i have a really
high uncertainty in the position and a
really high uncertainty in the velocity
and they both uncorrelated that same
matrix of a thousand zero or zero
thousand i specify an external motion
but a zero zero so has no effect so just
ignore this
I built a next state function which is
the one we just discussed one one zero
one that assumes that the velocity is
just being added to the position and the
velocity in expectation stays the same
I made a measurement function extracts
just the first of the two values one and
zero so I can observe the location but
not the velocity every measurement
uncertainty happens to be 1 in this
example and I have an identity matrix 1
0 0 1 and then I'm gonna filter with
these three measurements over here and
what should come out is that by running
the filter I can estimate the velocity
and therefore make better predictions in
the filter that I want you to program I
want the measurement update first and
then the motion update so every time we
run the filter I want you to update the
measurement first and the motion so
here's my empty procedure filter that
you have to fill in where I go through
our measurements and embrace the
measurement update and then the motion
update the prediction and then I just
print out the resulting estimates I do
this a number of times three times in
this case and once he filled this in a
hitter in the run button I get the
following output after my first
measurement update I observed the
location one which gets copied over
essentially to 0.99 nine over here and
learn nothing about the velocities is
still zero just have initialized it and
then there's an updated uncertainty
matrix which now shows what happens to
be a strong correlation a thousand a
thousand a thousand a thousand that
differs from the initial one only
they'll be filled in the off diagonal
elements happens to be exactly
what the common fitted us and then when
I observe again the two I want the
output to not tell me that my next
prediction is three
it's the observation plus the prediction
but now I've have a really good estimate
on what the velocity is it's essentially
one and the reason is my common fate I
was able to use the common field
equations to find this value there's a
new covariance matrix and for the third
observation followed by the prediction
the prediction is correctly effectively
for three point nine nine nine velocity
estimate is correctly one which is 0.99
nine nine nine and have yet another
uncertainty matrix which illustrates I
have hands high certainty in the
velocity estimate notes a relatively
high certainty in the position estimate
compared to my initial uncertainties so
can you write the algorithm filter that
outputs those exact values over here
this is an involved programming
assignment what you have to do is you
have to essentially implement the
equations I gave you have to familiarize
yourself with a matrix class and then go
and fill in the filter code in
accordance to the things that I showed
you for the multivariate to come in
