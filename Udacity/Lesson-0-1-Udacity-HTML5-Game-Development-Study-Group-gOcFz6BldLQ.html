everybody
hey thanks everyone it's a real honor to
be here tonight with so many people in
the class and this is the first group of
people that started filling the
classroom from the front usually it's so
it's it's been a real blast for us to
work together I want to quickly go
around my name is Peter lubbers I know
quite a few of you from the San
Francisco html5 user group I'm a program
manager at Google in the chrome
developer relations team can everyone
hear me in the back if you can
deliberate or okay if you can't hear him
just just get up he loves so been
working on this course with Colt and
Sean for the last about six or seven
months and it's been a real blast one of
the the most the most fun things I've
ever done
before I joined Google I did a lot of
html5 training and taking it to this
whole new scale with Udacity as being a
real real blast right so want to quickly
go around and then we'll go over some of
the logistics and what we're going to be
talking about yeah my name is Colt
McAnlis hello everyone participation I
enjoy it my name is Colt McAnlis I am
actually a developer advocate at Google
focusing on the chrome team mostly
performance and game development
I'm actually an ex game developer spent
about 10 years in the industry is
working on franchise titles like halo
Diablo 3 Blizzard or World of Warcraft
Starcraft 2 stuff like that was a
company navigate yeah there's people
distracted yes I'll spend about four
years as an adjunct professor at SMU
Guildhall school for video game
development so it was kind of really
nice to be able to approach Udacity and
see sort of how we're changing the
future of education especially in
America it's really nice to actually
look at something that's been so set in
stone for so long and really disrupt the
education and see how fast we
trained people to become amazing game
developers so and I'm Sean Bennett I
thought of course architects louder I'm
sorry can everyone hear me yes who wants
I know who doesn't want to hear me okay
I'm good seeing people laughing listen
okay so my name is Sean Bennett I am a
course architect at Udacity I've been
working there for about ten months or so
now I started working there on the web
development course with Steve Huffman
ever since then just had a blast working
with Udacity I see a lot of people in
the audience that I see from other
meetups so we've got a lot of stuff
going on here in the Bay Area and
elsewhere which it's always a lot of fun
to interact with you guys and just have
a great time so thank you for coming
here so we also have live a live stream
going on so everyone on the live stream
yeah hello thanks for tuning in I the
last I checked we have about 260 people
watching live which is great a couple of
quick logistical items about this study
group so first thing is it's an
eight-week
study group and of course we started we
wanted to have them on eight consecutive
Mondays but with Presidents Day we have
to move this event to Wednesday from now
on it will be on Wednesday it will be
waited Monday so sorry yeah yeah yeah so
it will be on Monday nights and it will
be in a different still third it will be
in a different room it'll be on I think
that the tenth floor but I'll give the
information out but just next time you
come in it'll be on a Monday and not a
different floor but from then on it will
always be in that room so we wanted to
have this so as you know we release the
units for this course like one a week so
this is sort of coincides with how the
future units will be rolled out so we
have how many units do we have up there
now we have three units up there right
now our units up there now
we'll start tonight with the discussion
on the first the first two visits and
then we'll track each unit as it comes
out so basically you have a week to go
through the unit come up with questions
we will open a moderator that we have up
here right now to ask questions so of
course if you're here you can have them
live but if you're not if you're on the
live stream we will open up this live
stream information so we're gonna be
sending all of the updates and so on to
the Udacity study group page so there's
the CS 255 page that you're already
signed up on you will get some emails
through that but also there's a study
group page that has all the links to it
so the links from tonight we're gonna be
posting there so that's a little bit
about the logistics any questions about
the logistics and if you have any
questions jump right in we have a mic up
here but if you're unable to get out
just shout it out so yeah just be loud
before we before we move on okay good
all right so tonight we really wanted to
go over units 0 &amp;amp; 1 but first of all
wanted to give a quick thank you to
everyone that has been suffering through
some of the issues you had with some of
the grading script you're all aware of
it we really appreciate the your
kindness of server you know working
through some of these issues without
blasting us lately so Sean can you give
an update on yes so we started out doing
Jasmine tests for those of you who are
familiar with some of the different
JavaScript test frameworks we started
with jasmine and it just really wasn't
working out we also had a system in
place where the tests would
automatically get injected into the page
with the student code and again
depending on when things loaded that got
ugly fast if any of you have ever dealt
with JavaScript loading issues you'll
understand what I'm what I'm talking
about
so we've we moved over to a few
different frameworks the ones that we're
using our combination of mocha chai and
sign
yeah so all doing different things so is
they're all good at different things
we've got most of the fixes on in the
pipeline hopefully those will be done by
the end of the week I will send an email
out as soon as those fixes are good to
go and then we'll have a new unit ready
to go on Monday and I'd also like to
thank all the students that have been
helping out with that especially the
ones that have been active in the forums
it's been amazing how much they have
helped out and mentioned oh you know to
work around this problem you do this so
it's it's been very very helpful to do
that I gotta say it really it really
makes it easy to be an incompetent
teacher when you have students that are
as good as they are out answering the
yeah to the forum's getting the problems
engine it makes it easier for me to be
lazy yeah really
mm-hmm yeah if but yeah so those should
be in the pipeline then they should be
done by the end of the week and if
they're not you should email me and yell
at me yeah yeah right there yeah yeah
well I'm sure you've gotten an email
from me you should have it so so for
tonight we really wanted to combine an
aspect that is not commonly part of a
MOOC the massive online open courses
please don't use that time I hate that
word so much with the online courses
typically like you have the benefits of
course are great but one of the
downsides is you don't really have to
talk to someone like you it's different
from being in an actual classroom so we
thought well let's experiment with this
where we obviously we're very lucky that
Google said okay you can have this this
menu and all the catering and so on all
provided by Google yeah quick if you
love the catering let's here yeah it's
like she's right pack that amazing yeah
amazing yeah you party yeah as a Cuban
party so but we wanted to combine that
aspect too to see you know like if
there's questions I mean it's kind of
hard sometimes if at the online training
is just sort of this one-way street
sometimes so we wanted to make it more
interactive and that's why we're having
sorry this is the study group so I
wanted to also start then with asking
you know you what kind of questions you
have we have a moderator you don't have
to put them in there because we'll get
to these questions but really wanted to
get to your questions first because you
made the effort to come all the way out
here so maybe we can start with a few
questions if you're anywhere near the
mic that would be very helpful we will
pick the questions otherwise well yeah
yeah if you can't get to the mic just
feel free to speak up any questions you
have it I don't think they even have to
necessarily be about unit zero and one
no um anything correlated if or if you
just want crazy stories crazy gamedev
stories yeah those are always a good
time I'd highly recommend we have the
blooper reel a lot of the crazy stories
but Tony you have a question Oh first
taker now it sounded like you had a
question
oh oh sorry
is bugging it's on it's just not
projecting yeah no sorry it's projecting
into there yeah what is your recommended
process of debugging so the error
messages don't always reflect exactly
what's going on and then if you look at
the standard JavaScript debugging tools
sometimes there's so much going on in
terms of the you know all the different
things interacting it's hard to actually
see your code mm-hmm right absolutely
yes so the question is what are
recommendations for debugging and
they're actually book tutors debugging
of quizzes and actually there are two
different questions there actually that
I'd I think would be good is debugging
the quizzes and debugging JavaScript
which I will let someone else answer the
second one debugging the quizzes I would
say that you should email me or ask
questions in the forums if you're
getting for example the special little
snowflake error message which you can
thank one of our engineers for coming up
with that phrase but yeah the first two
units some of the quizzes are just a
little bit hairy I would say most of
those should be fixed again by the end
of the week and if they are not you
should yell at me
debugging JavaScript in general is also
somewhat painful as we found out can be
but one of the tools that that I prefer
to use not biased here in chrome
developer tools have you used the chrome
developer tools to get any insight so
like like Sean said we have the two
different parts of the story so there's
the online experience of the the quizzes
which of course now you have the page
and your JavaScript but let's say you're
actually building your own game there's
actually a lot of great stuff in the
chrome developer tools have you have you
used those okay
yeah it's it's a large tool right very
clear so so debugging debugging the
scripts that are coming through the
Udacity page for the quizzes should be
very straightforward and if there's
problems there and if there's any errors
in their contact Sean and and and yell
at him angrily delegates absolutely so
so that's being done you shouldn't
really need to open the chrome developer
tools to do these scripts you should all
be automated off the site yeah so if the
then the second question is how do you
do bug javascript in general and as
Peter saying that if you haven't used
chrome developer tools go absorb as much
information as you can on it it's a
fantastic resource you get timelines you
get breakpoints you get everything else
you need a concise one of the things I
would like to quickly plug is an almost
a commercial but really great stuff so
and the live stream that we're looking
at tonight or you're not looking at but
is actually sponsored by Google
developers live they created this entire
mobile Google developers live kit that
we have out there streaming with a lot
of wires there's a lot of wire so we I
just got it today so bear with us um
they they have a lot of great shows one
of them specifically is called the break
point with you know after the break
points you set in your code it's
something I really highly recommend
because Paul Irish and addy Osmani
come on this show there's already about
five episodes that come out about every
two weeks or so and they give you some
really great insights into specific
areas of debugging so it's a little bit
too much perhaps to go into here if you
have any specific questions after we can
take a look at that but definitely check
out like there's a lot of stuff you can
learn just in the developer tools in
that space so I would highly recommend
that there's other tools to like you
know Firefox has the Firebug too
and they're working on some new
developer tools as well so all of these
tools have their own sort of insights
and are great and they're all pretty
much the same thing yesterday on Hacker
News it was trending on the top diablo
somebody wrote in javascript was pretty
awesome and yeah i'm just trying to get
an idea like what level of game are we
gonna be able to develop at the end of
the course like because i've seen some
really awesome examples out there so
just just wanted to get a idea like you
know this is gonna be like professional
like where does it course leave us done
it yeah what next I think it's a great
question so for those of you didn't hear
the question was what kind of game in
terms of architecture in terms of
quality at level what type of game are
we gonna have at the end of the course
so as most of you know the course is
actually based off the grits development
game that we made for Google i/o 2012
last year which is actually a player
versus player top-down shooter so if
you've ever played Super Smash TV or Gun
brothers things along those lines
basically taking a top-down perspective
and you're running your little robots
around shooting missiles at other
players now we've actually broken the
course the entire content of course into
two classes actually client side and
server side now CS 255 is actually all
the client-side data so when you're done
with this course you'll have every piece
you need to know to create a
two-dimensional top-down physics based
input driven robot killing massacre
machine it's gonna be amazing
let's except for other players it's
different players yes so and then what
we're gonna do is of course a lot of
people are looking at this course and
making sure that it's you know it's
getting the traction it needs to once
once we really feel that we're getting
the student input and we need everything
we can then we'll start working on the
next course and the next course will tie
everything together with putting
together things like using Google App
Engine for matchmaking log in player
identity purchasing goods issuing
credits as well as maybe if you're all
lucky and eat your dinner how to use
Google compute engine to host virtual
games so this is all coming in the
future and that'll tie everything
together we did for grits live in there
I thought I thought the matchmaking
service was on compute engine match
biggies actually
all on Google App Engine okay yeah that
was the other way around no we run a
persistent back-end okay they'll do all
the matchmaking stuff okay it seems yeah
actually it's actually very complex yeah
what are your recommendations for them
storyboarding and playlist process
process flows in place before you even
get started with the game with the game
with the game yeah well in its entirety
when you're actually building out the
game so the game not course Gus I'm
trying to dodge ha
so for those of you didn't hear what is
the recommendation for doing
storyboarding and data gathering and how
do you plot out the course of actually
building a game because it's a pretty
monumental task and its really really
mind-numbing so I will say this is I've
been through this process a handful of
times and this is my personal opinion
about the proper way to go every game
studio you go to and every game
developer you meet is gonna have their
own secret sauce on the way they think
things should actually work and of
course if you talk to a mobile developer
versus a console developer they'll
generally butt heads about the way
things need to work as well because you
have to worry about economic concerns
and size of teams and you know how long
you're gonna end up in the top 10 on
whatever market place versus how much
the publishers taking away for shipping
your console game because it has to sit
on a shelf at Walmart for 600 anyhow
when it all gets down to the development
the idea always starts with a designer
right so in game development we usually
have a three or four slot setup you've
got programmer artist designer and then
producer slash management slash
everybody else who's not actually
putting bits in the box right usually
the way things will work as a designer
I'll sit down and say I've got this
great idea based upon some other game I
will have to say that the most
successful products we've ever seen in
the games industry have either been edge
of genre for new devices right Angry
Birds was actually not necessarily new
in terms of concept but it was edge of
genre for a brand new device it was the
first time that we were actually able to
interact in an entertaining way with
this new piece of hardware as opposed to
like halo right halo again was not new
it was actually kind of a remake of what
you saw with double-oh-seven Goldeneye
on the exit intent of 64 but again edge
of genre so typically what game
designers will do they'll find these
existing games and bill
upon them they'll say these things are
good these things are bad and they'll
move forward now in that concept after
they've developed their idea they'll
typically move into a phase where they
actually start generating the story
right and this actually follows very
much game developers are actually trying
to mimic more of what movie producers
and book producers do right so they'll
attend classes on how to make movies and
how to write books and how to put
together good storyboards because they
realize that those guys actually have
probably the best processes in place now
here's where things diverge a little bit
most game studios who found success
actually realize that the only way to
achieve it is through massive amounts of
horrible teeth grinding iterations right
which means while the designer is
sitting here trying to create this baby
of imagination
the producers cracking whips saying we
have to ship stuff on a certain date and
then the programmers get involved and
they artists get involved and so
basically everyone's kind of tumbling
over themselves iterating on these
concepts because the designer may come
up with a great storyline but may not
manifest itself as something that's
actually fun to play but you don't know
that until the artists have put in all
the content and the programmers have put
in all the gameplay mechanics right so
then you spend all these hours putting
stuff together and then die off are you
still you're not yet you're not still
there I'm not still there we have a
follow-up question middle the crowded
press the yes button yeah
Oh Sprint's so the question was you know
where do standard software development
processes fit in the world of game
development to surprise semis is that a
pretty okay way to so I will say they
don't so waterfall methodology scrum
methodology agile development pair
programming game developers don't care
to be honest with you and most of us are
not educated in these terminologies most
of this is actually implanted on us by
managers who just got hired at the
company who spent the last six weeks on
black belt Six Sigma right and they're
like you guys have to follow this
pattern in reality game developers were
artists right we spent a lot of time
immersing ourselves on what's the best
dps for our cleric double-billed with a
druid right and those are programmers
right we could care less about your
waterfall methodology and how this gets
done now I will say that successful
studios that follow these mentalities
have the right people in place to make
it successful but most game developers
are young they're not very good
developers and they don't have a lot of
experience on iterative failure if that
makes sense
right like think about the games
industry as a whole it's actually not
driven by people who've been in it for
60 years it's mostly driven by
20-somethings who don't have a wife
don't have a kid and can spend 22 hours
a day at the office
eating pop-tarts crunching on a game
that will never see the light of day and
loving it because the other two hours
there again they're balancing their dps
on their cleric dual Road so they can
actually get into the freakin guild that
does the raid on megaphone every Monday
nag offend anybody
nag offend no one is an EverQuest
crackhead in here fantastic that's
dating myself there how do you how do
you feel about that I love it ok so um
to kind of wrap it up cuz I know we have
more people question I can I can rant
about game developing the processes all
day that the main thing is this is that
the game development industry itself is
extremely young now we've been making
video games since the late 80s but we're
still very young and the reason is that
we're a young industry it's a wild wild
west industry especially in 2009 when we
saw the advent of
social gaming casual gaming as well as
mobile gaming all come on the scene at
once once you heard that first time in
the wind that farmville was making
billions of dollars and you looked at
that game and said this this is making
money imagine you know 200 300 thousand
other developers that said the same
exact thing overnight everyone became a
game developer overnight everyone wanted
to do gamification right little did they
know there was a lot of us who were
sitting around or like hey you kids get
off my lawn right so the truth of the
matter is you fly by the seat of your
pants iterate iterate iterate find
something fun it's it's really follow
faker Grimlock lean entrepreneurship is
if you want to if you want to find
something that matches what game
development does look at how lean
entrepreneurs run their companies right
you iterate you find the failure points
fastest the game that ships is not the
best one it's the one that you had when
time ran out and that's that's been in
since the beginning of time unless
you're it or Blizzard and then you
iterate on a game for 12 years but
that's what separate us like the whole
point of this course well not the whole
point a large part of this course is
basically drawing things to canvas but
there doesn't seem to be any actual way
to assert that anything actually was
done on campus you know I can't like
unit tests that I actually did you're
all that on canvas or I have layered
them in this order how do I do that with
canvas basically basically you need to
create a log wrapper right so the
question is how do you query the canvas
for what you've done to it essentially
if I if I get get the gist of it and
basically you have to create a wrapper
around the canvas that you log all the
information to as far as I can tell yeah
yeah so basically you can call get
getusermedia on the canvas object and
that'll return a byte array of pixels
and then you can either log that in
memory send it over to a Native Client
module write it to the file system or
whatever you can probably do that on
each RAF callback request I know we have
found in that quest animation frames yes
but
you can you can probably capture each
frame of your simulation using the
getusermedia and then write it to disk
if you want to automate this in a
headless fashion which i think is a
little bit more to the core of your
point then we have to take a step back
and look at web development as an
ecosystem and and I can rant about that
for hours about you know the vision of
what the web is and how developers
should approach the web and how that's
different from game development you know
in game development it's got a raw pixel
buffer and anything you need and you can
kind of unit test to your heart's
consent but unfortunately in the web
you've got sandbox after sandbox after
sandbox you have to jump through to get
access to the most trivial thing and I
know nothing about game development and
actuality but is this the way I mean you
you guys real games are developing on
are developed on immediate mode renders
just like canvas I suppose and so you
guys can't really have been you know
taking screenshots every frame and
asserting things were you doing
something else how do you test in games
in general oh great that was a follow-up
question how do you test in games in
general specifically with graphics and
whatnot um it's it's very it's very
teeth numbing usually you have one guy
sitting in the corner he's usually bald
probably has facial hair and usually
what that guy's job is is the entire
graphics engine and what he'll do is
he'll have a guy sitting next to him
who's in charge with the art pipeline
and basically what these guys do is
every day they boot up the game and they
run through the levels and they make
sure things look right and and I know
this any but you got to remember
everything's so iterative that the time
to create the test is often blown away
by all the resources to create the
environment or you know I recently saw
something that Paul Irish was demoing I
think it's in Canary where you can
actually go in the chrome developer
tools once again you can replay anything
on a canvas like literally frame by
frame by frame I'm not exactly sure this
can use motor skew I think there's
already a WebGL inspector that will do
stuff like this but it's not built in
yeah won't do 2d canvas
animations yeah yeah yeah I will I will
also say this is a follow-up is that
there are great tools out there
depending on your platform so if you're
actually programming on Windows there's
a fantastic tool called pix I think it's
actually been replaced in Visual Studio
20 2010 with Windows graphics inspector
wiggy there something like that nearly
as cool a name yeah I know fix me so
much cooler but effectively that'll
allow you to do frame by frame break
down and actually do frame captures now
if you're not actually programming
direct3d you're actually using OpenGL
Nvidia AMD ATI those guys all have
proprietary tools they ship out to
developers that allow you to do
graphical analysis and debugging in fact
NVIDIA is probably one of my favorites
called NV NV as Nvidia perf HUD and
that's fantastic it requires you to take
a couple modifications to your code to
be able to get the visualizations but
the really cool thing is because they
wrote the system and own the hardware is
you can do stuff like show me a heat map
of how many pixels have been over
drawing right over draw being a very
important metric for video game
development because that's how many
times you've read drawn a pixel that
actually doesn't contribute to the scene
so you've spent all those processor
cycles actually coloring this pixel only
to draw an ogre on top of it and then
draw a wall in front of him and then
draw a portal in front of that so you
don't see any of that data but you've
processed all of it right and then you
get into occlusion culling and I can
dive deep on that too but if you do that
if you're doing standard development
check out pix Envy perf hood
unfortunately we don't have really good
good versions for the web that rival
those tools but I hope one day we do
question quick answer probably I just
what's the best way to get the most out
of this course like is there anything I
should think about or not say just
actually yeah repeat the question yeah
so the question was what's the best way
to get the most out of this course
one thing I would wanna I just actually
I was just thinking to hold the question
until I was gonna say something about it
we're running a contest how many if you
are aware of this contest ok so a fair
amount at least about half of yeah but
check out on the Udacity site
there's a blog write that blog what
doesn't blog that blog udacity.com and
it'll link to the wiki there's a there's
a blog post that has all the details
about the contest so we're running in
parallel with this study group
effectively a contest of building your
own game so I think one way to get a lot
out of it is to really try things right
like not just the things that were the
challenges we're giving you but actually
try out your own game and it can be
completely different with this contest
there's some really cool prizes actually
two really cool ones the main prizes
our first one is a ticket to Google i/o
if you've tried to get a ticket and then
you know how hard it is and the other
one is a cameo appearance in one of the
future Udacity movies with all expenses
paid
yeah in this case it's a trip out of you
yeah I hope you like mountain for those
on the livestream this yeah it could be
in many places of course unfortunately
there are a couple of legal little rooms
and a couple of excluded countries
unfortunately that's really not our just
we wanted to open it up for everyone but
it's pretty much open for the most part
yeah yeah we we fought honestly to open
up as much as possible yeah so I'd also
like to point this out as a game
developer who kind of taught himself how
to program video games like this
education didn't exist when I was
starting right like to understand how to
build a quadtree and binary space
partition the way I taught myself is
actually looking at the quake source
code I actually taught myself 3d
mathematics analyzing the quake source
code is the first time I'd ever seen a Z
variable I was like what is this what is
wire what are we doing with the Z thing
and unfortunately their coordinate
system was weird so Z was up and I like
why yeah I know
a separate separate age-dating thing so
what I suggest you do is this watch the
course go through the quizzes and then
go find an html5 game and figure out
where they're doing that same thing
we're gonna start talking about
rendering Maps we're gonna start talking
about input collision handling we're
gonna talk about sound if you can take
what you're learning in our class and
find in someone else's codebase how
they're doing it
then you're gonna learn a lot more that
way right so if you just contain
yourself to our stuff fantastic I really
want to see you guys use this as a
springboard go check out impact j/s go
go check out cocoon Jas go check out
play bio lab comm right go look at these
these different JavaScript games are and
just look for JavaScript html5 game
right look at their source code see if
you can find the same patterns in there
and again if you see something there
that doesn't match with what we're
talking about ask us we have that we'd
love to figure out what's going on - we
might be doing it wrong we very welcome
that's really what I recommend is fine
the patterns we're teaching you in other
people's source code and then to see how
they're using it why they're using it
you're gonna find out a lot more data
that way I'd also say find inspiration
there for whatever you want to build for
yourself and then come ask us those
questions like if you've got an idea for
a game and you can't figure out oh I've
got this problem with it that you want
to submit for the contest this is a
great place to ask questions about it
and try and figure it out that's the
point
and one other things you can team up
with other people to do this game right
so accept ups
yeah yeah and do that you don't you
don't want to work with it's working for
the internal audio so there's really two
follow-ups here on that the question
about you know what are you gonna get
out of this course I have scars all over
my face from doing graphics the hard way
back in this and you talk about dating
yourself so but but really what I I
don't really want to build a game so
don't kick me out of here I want to use
these techniques to say I did all those
things the hard way in the past and now
I want to know the prescribed way that
works efficiently inside of today's
browsers okay and I want to use some of
these techniques like having balls go
around a screen that might be pieces of
data that you've recently accessed in
and clicking on them and getting input
and drilling down and
that so Peter has seen my 3d video and
what I want to also know from Udacity is
what is the philosophy about Udacity
about creating derivative courses
because I already have some ideas about
courses that could be derived from the
base material that you learned in this
one
all right so learning I think is a
lifelong you know activity and what
you're doing is getting me back into
some things that I put away because they
were you know kind of too easy you know
I think the hard way and then I lost
interested in doing the easy way but
it's all relevant again so I want to
know I guess the question here is what's
your philosophy about proposing and
potentially doing derivative courses
okay so the question is for those of you
who couldn't hear what is Udacity z--
philosophy for proposing and doing
derivative courses which is a pretty big
question I don't want to speak for the
entire company of Udacity on livestream
talk to me later
no I I think I can safely say that
Udacity is all about education and the
more people we can educate and the
better we can educate them the better if
you have an idea for a course or if you
have something that you'd like to do
talk to us I mean we would very much
love to hear it we want to do as much as
possible to drive people's education
especially in these kind of cutting-edge
areas where you know we're cutting
ourselves as much off as anything else
any trouble yes I got from last
thursday's banging from today you guys
are very enthusiastic and open about
this I just want to say that it comes
through thank you so I had the suspicion
that you guys would be receptive okay to
ideas about how to improve the process
and then you're not going to be like
well we know it all
you guys are in a different level okay
okay that does happen if yes you know
but let me just stop you right there so
he just said we he was afraid that we
might say that you know we know it all
yes we we do not even remotely know it
all we are still figuring out this whole
online education MOOCs if you want to
call them that thing and we're kind of
flying by the seat of our pants and we
really like it that way so we love
figuring out new ways and better ways to
to teach people I know there's other
people in the room that'll do it too but
I'm gonna pester you guys to go further
in portion okay thank you thank you yeah
absolutely and I will tell you that my
wife reminds me every day that I'm wrong
so obviously I don't know everything
I love you honey sure thank you have a
question is for you yeah let's start
take it so our first question is will we
be building up our own game as we follow
along with the course so I think the
simple answer for that is yes actually
in two ways one is perhaps you're gonna
be part of the contest that's cool yeah
if obviously all the source code for
grits is already out there right you can
take that today and play around with it
actually one quick note is we're working
on one issue where the grits game
currently is not it's not starting
yeah a server no that was the compute
engine thing yeah yeah okay we're
switching yeah but the whole thing and
look at the entire sources so you don't
even have to wait week by week you can
have all of that and you can build your
own game so yes basically that's profits
in multiple ways yeah and so I'll say
this just as a follow up on that is that
the term game is I think ambiguous and a
lot of people use it in different ways
to mean different things by the end of
this first course you're gonna have
every piece of a toolkit of a toolbox
that you would ever need to make the
type of game we're presenting right but
we're not going to teach you like this
we're not teaching you how an isometric
engine works to make a Diablo 3 clone
we're also not teaching you how to do
proper server-side interaction for
mm oh right but we are teaching you the
basics on how to get stuff moving if you
if you use the word game as all these
higher-order primitives like you know I
want to make sure that I create the hal
bard of amazing right and every time it
hits a bald guy gives them hair we're
not gonna cover that because that's very
yeah well guys we've come up I want that
thing that smack me in the face so we're
not we're not gonna work on that but by
the end of this course you you'll have a
firm understanding of how grits works
how the type of game works and then be
able to translate that to what you're
doing that and just a quick note on that
previous question one more thing so this
is the client-side version it's cry snow
in Flint quite important because we're
actively discussing doing the
server-side as a follow up second course
of course it's going to depend on ya our
successful discuss so your friends can
take the course yeah if you want
server-side stuff tell your friends take
ours
WebSockets for the win WebSockets so
next question how important is it that
we learn Residex method to create
classes over to various other ways to
use inheritance in javascript prototype
property in code Academy's guide object
create an Indian's guy class prototype
general thoughts i let me let me hit
this from number one it does not matter
you need you need object inheritance you
need to be able to define a class
prototype and inherit from that class
override from that class if you have a
preferred method that floats your boat
more than the method we got fantastic we
chose reza get works it's efficient res
exact great guy you know that's the one
we chose the one we use with and also
it's the same one that's used in the
impact j/s engine so if you actually go
take a look at the impact jaya source
code or the injector for ejecta
framework you'll see very similar trends
there it's just the one we found the one
we thought that was nice and kind of
worked with there this next question is
kind of a big one the question is any
tips for keeping the project structure
beautiful and well-organized when it
starts becoming really huge this is a
fool's errand
okay so I'll jump in again here because
I'm loud and I don't stop talking yeah
so so I've worked on a couple million
plus line code bases before in a couple
different setups and every company has
their own vibe on how to handle these
things one company's million-plus line
code base they were like you know it's
all C++ code everything has to be in
dll's right because if you change the AI
code I don't want to have to recompile
my graphics engine and he shouldn't have
to recompile all of his spatial sorting
data right another company was like
screw all of you because DLL hell is
stupid so all the code is in one thing
and we just use incredible and
incredible does all that the the best
thing we can really come down to is unit
test your code testing rocks debugging
sucks right and we've seen this
everywhere
game developers aren't good at doing
this we need to get better because we
spend a lot of time not doing the right
thing other stuff is make sure you get a
buddy to look at your code and I know
that's not a structure of like
management but having having some dude
who's not bald take a look at your code
will reveal a lot of problems go out
that last points important this really
is I'm a bald guy it happens a lot
really go out and look at a lot of other
companies and how they do it go read
Google's architecture manifestos and all
the books that are published out there
about how Google manages its
infrastructure in the videos and stuff
like that go read all of Valve's papers
who plays valve games awesome go they
have a great they have a great website
that they list all of their demos and
all of their publications Crytek another
great company that lists tons of
information insomniac another great
company that lists all their data go
look at their stuff figure out how to do
it every company is different every
methodology is different once you get
above a million lines of code it's just
a bunch of people throwing rocks at a
dinosaur as it's a beautiful metaphor it
really is and the great thing is once
you get about above a million lines I
dare you to be the enterprising soul
that figures out how many megabytes of
strings you have in that million lines
of code and then figure out how many of
those megabytes shipped yeah so next
question is although there's so much
resource available now I sometimes feel
lost
is there any roadmap for a web developer
game developer what core skills should I
focus on and learn this actually came up
last Thursday when we have the Google
developers live session with Sebastian
similar question was asked then and I
think that's definitely a problem I mean
there's a lot of stuff available but you
know trying to make sense and going to
the right places is important so for
example one of the efforts were heavily
involved in at Google and a lot of other
browser vendors is something called web
platform dogs some of you that have been
for at the SF html5 meetups have hurt me
going on and on about that I won't bore
you too much with it but it's a great
effort where all of the browser vendors
are coming together to create sort of
the canonical reference for web
documentation down the line there are
some training plans for that that's not
there yet
places like Udacity are building up this
curriculum that's great I think to take
a step back I think clearly with any
sort of html5 games javascript is a
really important part so get get started
with that we have that units zero in
here but there's a lot of other
resources another thing I would mention
is really get to know to developer tools
we talked about it in the first question
chrome developer tools other developer
tools they're all great tools for really
zooming in on what's happening on our
covers we're actually going to come out
with an interesting developer tools
training course not on Udacity but
pretty soon so stay tuned for more
details on any other suggestions I would
say just more about figure out the tools
that you are going to use whether it's
you know web development game
development whatever find a set of tools
that you feel really comfortable with
even if it's something obscure like
Emacs Emacs and figure out a workflow
whatever works for you just make that as
efficient as possible because your tools
are really what makes you as a developer
I feel like
as far as game developers are concerned
I'm a big fan of fake it until you make
it I think that that's probably one of
the most important things you could have
as a game developer is and I've given
this advice to my students for years is
you want to make a game
fantastic go tell me how that guy made
that game right it's it's that mental
exercise how did that person make that
product go duplicate that and and
believe it or not running through that
mental exercise will make you a better
developer than half of the people you're
sitting next to tomorrow at work because
you're going through the process you're
saying wait a minute how did they get
that pathing how when I click here
versus I click there how did they get
this flock of demons to go assault the
gate of um Thea off right like how does
all this work how does all this fit
together I'm a big fan of just trying to
figure it so you make it then go look at
source code source code source code
source code and by the way just real
quick guys if you guys have more
questions feel free to keep coming up
until then we're just gonna keep going
through the Google moderator question it
out yeah that just you know start
yelling so let's take one more before
this one with Google App engines a good
back-end for a game like the ones will
be learning to create uh so yes with a
caveat so you have to understand what
kind of game you're trying to make so
for html5 right you have sort of a
different set up you've got some server
that's going to be serving the content
like it's a web server right Apache
server or anything like that's just
gonna be serving the content we call
that the client-side data even though
it's being served from a server whatever
then you have to look at what your
server is actually doing so how many
people play word with words with friends
chest with friends turn-based games
chess over email wow you guys really
have farmville see that was a test to
see company would admit some bank on it
to it yeah so they're basically I I
break down video games that are
networked into two classifications the
first classification is turn-based games
right so these are games that will do
some action push the state up to a
server typically they'll be pushed into
an SQL database or some other data store
MongoDB or anything and then you know
another client somewhere will ping it
and receive that data Twitter
kind of works this way if you think
about it right someone tweets oh my god
these burgers are so amazing but Inc
gets pushed up to a server someone else
it gets a feed and it hits their disk
right words with friends
farmville all these games actually work
along that same mechanic now for that
type of game Google App Engine works
very well it supports simple api's it
has a database processing it actually
has file store processing all that stuff
fantastic now there's a second
classification of games and again I am
NOT a network programmer I'm sure
there's many shades of grey in here
the other second is a real-time or
synchronous based turn play and what
this is is this is like your player
versus player games right so this is
like I shoot a missile at you and I am
expecting that you're gonna see that
missile movement in space at 60 frames a
second now Google App Engine and other
sort of servers like that don't have the
prot well I mean technically they do
have the processing power but it's
actually not a good fit for it instead
you want to use more Swords
virtualization machines where you can
actually run some C++ code on a machine
and actually have that doing the live
synchronization between all these
clients so in that you actually get an
authoritative server and then you get
this ring of clients that are actually
letting the server be the main compute
and because of that you're very compute
heavy on the server so thing like web
services like Google App Engine really
aren't that well for you instead you
want to be looking at things like you
know ec2 or Google compute engine right
where you can actually prop a VM up into
a cloud and let it sit there and run
some stuff follow up here in the middle
and basically it's just the messages
that now instruct the client what to do
it as long as you have all your assets
on the clients all of the clients then
that it's great absolutely and and
that's a really good point that not so
back in the early 90s every game was
peer-to-peer because we really didn't
have the compute resources as the
Internet community and the gaming
community actually put these dedicated
machines in a lot of places
so everything was peer-to-peer then
people started hacking counter life
anyone remember the headshot hack Wow
okay kind of striking me in
counter-strike yeah yeah what do I say
counter life you said it was based on
the half-life engine yeah the headshot
hack effectively modified the
client-side resources of your game
turned all the textures white except for
the heads of the other players those
were bright red and then they would
actually run a screen by screen
algorithm they would determine any red
pixels aim at it and shoot so you were
guaranteed to get a headshot every
single time when this started happening
game developers realized maybe we
shouldn't have everything on the client
so they started migrating to the concept
of the authoritative server which is
that you kind of have these dub
terminals that are doing some sort of
predictive analysis but generally have
most of the computation somewhere else
MMOs work this way right when you move
and you see this your other bud who's
got a bad lag well like stop between
here while he's doing his chicken dance
or whatever and it's not part of the
dance that's actually because the
clients are doing predictive analysis
but the server's then correcting the
actual position now there is a couple of
genres of games to date that still abide
by their player 2 player routes and
that's RTS games and networked fighting
games and the reason for this is exactly
what he pointed out which was that it's
actually too much computational capacity
to have it pushed to the server right if
you're in an RTS game and you've got 200
units and I've got 200 units and you've
got 200 units we have to somehow
synchronize that at 60 frames a second
and pushing all that stake to the server
might not actually work so again it kind
of comes down to the game you're making
so to the question does App Engine look
good for the type of game we are going
to make in this not really
App Engine we're gonna use hopefully in
unit 2 to do matchmaking login identity
purchase of items
credit transfer app engine or Google
Analytics all sorts of fun stuff like
that but the actual computational
capacity about where the game is being
computed is hopefully going to be run on
Google compute engine yes sir very good
development project to get feedback on
what you are doing like whenever I had
to learn a language like beat C Python
or something
using a trying with a game has been the
most the best way to learn the language
itself like you you get a feedback off
you get the feedback you iterate to it
you write a lot of code so having that
background and me what can I expect from
this html5 game development course what
what are the technologies which I will
be like iterating through learning much
be Javas html5 or something else right
so the question was just to summarize
for other languages yet used a lot of to
learn the language it used a game as a
ideal way to learn it and how would this
course dress that actually that's a
little bit of a back story behind this
course when we first started talking
about this course it wasn't a game
development course yeah
it was actually oh we should do
something around html5 and one of the
best ways to push any platform is try to
run games in it that only expose all the
weaknesses very very quickly it wasn't
until actually yeah Sean have built an
example game and we ended up talking
about it and it's like hey we've got
this great game that called that build
mm-hmm for i/o which is much more fully
fledged since like why don't we do that
so in fact very similar to your I'm
sorry it kind of evolved is the same way
yeah and I think you'll find very much
the same concepts like these concepts
there was a I think Tony you've
mentioned it like I don't necessarily
want to build a game but I want to use
the lessons learned I think that's for a
lot of parts very possible clearly
there's gonna be some areas that are
pretty much deep down into the game
parts but
I hope you'll find us yeah yep yeah
exactly and we're not actually using too
many libraries I mean a few here to do
some things that would just take too
long to do but most of it like people
have asked this question about like hey
what libraries are we gonna learn and
all of that that's actually we've kind
of kept it kind of basic so you can
really see what's happening and of
course in your own project you might use
them so yeah we've really tried to avoid
libraries for the most part yeah that
the main part where we we chose not to
do that was physics like for good reason
let's see a couple more questions okay
so what are the main advantages of
making a game in html5 over other ways
like flash well clearly you know flash
is pretty much gone its way out yeah
so even Adobe is going fairly strongly
towards I mean they they've pushed html5
off the main sponsors of right it's all
five yeah yeah so ubiquity of the web
not having to use a plug-in mm-hmm I
mean the whole point of html5 started
with that right like we should have
Native li the capabilities to do the
things that people wanted to do and
that's not limited to just games but for
many other things as well so that's I
think that would describe it you know
I'll make one follow up for that
so I think one of the interesting things
about html5 first off a shout out from
Elko Nevada my fellow Nevada in oh yeah
awesome I was born a roll yeah I was
born raised in Las Vegas so should have
mad props yeah yeah so what what are the
interesting things about Flash and other
sort of development plugins even Native
Client included is that it's kind of an
isolated compute right so basically it's
this element on your page and all the
code is running inside of this little
element and to get out
of that element into the Dom or into the
rest of the browser you kind of have to
go to this very limited postmessage api
which really only send like a chunk of
binary data or a string right that's one
of the differences with html5 is that
you're executing JavaScript next to the
Dom you have full access full control
there you also can go right to the file
system from there you get access to
audio you get access to all these
different things right there native in
the browser you don't have to kind of go
through this post message interface to
then modify the Dom right because I kind
of split your code bases between the two
now I will say that I'm very biased I
love Native Client I think it's a
fantastic technology especially with
portable Native Client coming down the
road I say that because I love C++ and I
feel that if you're writing
high-performance applications that you
should be doing it as close to the metal
as possible again personal opinion not
the opinion of any companies or
organizations I may be affiliated with
all rights regarded and all those other
fun things security I really I really do
like those different technologies and
and I will say this and I say this to
every single game developer because I
get a lot of developers who come to me
and say what language what technology
should I write my game in like give me
the answer and I never answer them I
actually asked them a lot of questions
like okay what what's what's your studio
history what kind of games have you made
what products have you made would you
have an existing code base do you have a
legacy understanding right I'm not gonna
tell a C++ developer to go learn html5
if you got a million lines of C++ code
use Native Client Chrome has what 350
million users right now I mean depending
on what statistic you look at that's a
huge lion share of market right if you
if you're a web developer I'm not gonna
tell you to go use C++ I'm not gonna
tell you learn ActionScript either in
very ways if you're an ActionScript
developer today an ActionScript
developer you know keep rockin it dude
no matter what you're wearing so I
really do think it comes back to who you
are and what you're doing and what
benefits you get there take a look at
your history and just find what matches
because it shouldn't be about the
language it should be up to about the
experience and the data quit limiting
yourself about what language you're
using I think as programmers we've all
given up on that holy war if you haven't
yet please do for those of us who are
bold
answered part of my question about you
know kind of what you would consider
best technologies for gay for creating
games especially within html5 and as a
follow-up question within the course
will you cover all their alternatives to
what you're you know going through in
the course and with grids who all the
alternatives ok so so so first question
to paraphrase it is you know what do you
repeat the question
so to repeat the question actually you
lost track give it to me yeah all right
this guy yeah best technology would you
consider the technologies being shown in
the course kind of the best technologies
especially for html5 games got it man
yes so here's what I'm gonna say is
again it's not about the language it's
about the experience so in html5
unfortunately today there's an upper
limit if you want to do more than 300
draws a frame you're stuck you really
can't do it if you want control to
memory really can't do it you know you
want to avoid garbage collection code
really can't do it right you can get to
3d with WebGL but then you're fighting
this battle that JavaScript really isn't
a language that's engineered to handle
binary data yet you're trying to use an
API that at its core is built upon
performance from binary data you know
you've got these different ideas
fighting each other in that realm once
you hit that level I think you should
definitely start looking at what other
technologies are available to you
because again it's experience if you
need to do 3000 draws a frame and
actually access OpenGL in a way that's
gonna be that's gonna manifest itself in
a performance manner native clients
fantastic right I mean we've already
seen what 30-something games that
shipped on Native Client last year there
were xbox360 ports right like oh hey
let's take this console game and lecture
you put in a web browser right
translating the back back to html5 is
really daunting I know someone's hand
will shoot up and go what about em
scripting I think it's a great idea I
think it's fantastic technology I think
you're still gonna hit the upper limits
you still can only do a certain number
of draws a frame certain number compute
a frame you're still bound by sandbox
restriction by RAF callbacks and all
these other restrictions that make the
web what it is if you want to
high-performance stuff you hit that
layer that being said - if you don't
need that then you're kind of in the JA
in the flash in html5 world and that's
that's okay and it's okay the second
part second part of the question was
will that be covered no sorry yeah only
so many hours yeah right so we won't
actually cover it those just like we
have the libraries we're not actually
going to go into much detail like
pulling in libraries to do random things
pretty much keep it like that keep it
pretty much to the basics it's already
pretty complex yeah
but we're definitely happy to give you
some pointers - lot of resources around
them all right so we have a couple
minutes yeah one minute one minute we
will go a couple minutes ago yeah is
there a unit testing framework you would
recommend for this course Oh unit
testing frameworks okay
so again what we're using is a
combination of mocha chai and sign-on
which I think I'm pronouncing right
mocha is actually a BDD behavior driven
development testing framework which is
really fantastic I'd really recommend
checking out the only problem actually
with all of these is that the
documentation isn't necessarily
fantastic mocha actually has better
documentation than most but a lot of
these unit testing frameworks are new or
relatively new and trying to figure out
how exactly everything works is a little
daunting so you might have to end up
looking through the source of it which
is some of the problems we're running
into is lack of documentation chai is an
expect framework which basically is a
framework for writing very readable
testing so expect this variable to equal
that for example it allows you to write
a code test code that someone who isn't
necessarily a developer can probably
read fairly easily so it's it's very
good in that regard another thing that
you can do is sign-on which is a mocking
or stubbing library and mocking is
basically when you
say okay I want to watch this object and
I want to create a fake version of it so
that when it's called with certain very
certain values I wanted to return this
or that or I just want to be able to
know when it does get called I want to
spy on it and say okay these the
arguments that it's gotten called on so
that I know it's performing right these
three frameworks all kind of do do
somewhat separate things getting them to
all talk to each other is a little bit
difficult but doable
I would I would recommend checking all
of them out depending on what you need
for your project for this course I'd say
that probably mocha and chai is enough
but I would recommend checking all three
of them out they're actually all pretty
good frameworks so we've we've got a
question over there that's on deck just
one moment I know some of you need to go
at eight o'clock and we said we would be
done at 8 so we'll go over a couple of
minutes not a problem but just a couple
of quick notes again next Monday and
then every Monday after that will be the
next course same time like I said well
we'll start around so we'll start the
live stream and everything at 7:00 we'll
have food and drink before the event so
you can feel free to come in well
probably open the doors around 6:00 and
you can come and hang out for a little
bit than beforehand so that's for the
next course we're going to set up a
moderator just like this one sooner than
we did this time so we'll have that live
it's actually hurry up yeah it's already
up so thank you all right so we'll get
to those questions next week so
definitely for the live stream
yeah if you're not here to answer it ask
the questions definitely ask them there
and let's see so we'll go we'll take
everything yep two more questions on the
live stream but first a live one after
an hour of questions by an educated
audience I'd like to ask you what
question do you think should have been
asked that wasn't and I'd like to ask
Colin because he's so candid and another
way of looking at that is is there an
Achilles heel here is there any area
that you would prefer people not ask you
about because
I figured out that much
it's a very good question okay so to
repeat the question he was asking what
question do we wish had been asked and
what question are we happy do we not
want to ask well we definitely wants you
to ask yeah I would actually say there's
no we're not honestly I can't think of a
question I would rather you not ask
especially if it's embarrassed about
vendor preference yes don't ask us about
adoptions or like when is this spec
gonna be adopted by browser a B and C
that's that's really none of our
business
don't don't don't talk to us about no or
don't ask us rather sorry don't talk to
us yeah channel 5 shield we we really I
really don't have comments I'll put it
that way we don't have comments on
adoption of features we don't have a
comments on the viewpoint on
technologies if you have like what is
Google slash Udacity's view on X Y &amp;amp; Z
I got no idea and I'm the wrong person
to ask as I'm bald that stuff's really
kind of not our wheelhouse if you want
to know about games ask us everything
about games and if I'm happy to tell you
I'm yeah I don't know where I'm wrong I
guess I have perhaps expected a couple
more questions on some of the actual
unit content that you may have been
struggling with if there is then of
course we have the forums you know
definitely do bring those questions I
can't imagine it's all perfect and
there's no question so yeah but yeah I
would love questions in the vein of I
have this idea and I'm not sure how to
actually make make it or build it those
are the questions that I would
personally really love to hear so a
couple of quick questions from online
thanks for the other question so where's
the best place to set up an environment
for our game project at least for this
class I mean
Shawn do you wanna buy and I'm not sure
what you mean by environment really um
it's like where to host the code
I'd say github okay so this is a big
yeah definitely definitely get some sort
of free hosted source control
code.google.com/apis/console they're all
fantastic ide is pick your poison
yeah for html5 development I use a
combination of sublime text 2 and coda
depending on what hardware I'm working
on that day from there obviously you
know separate tools doesn't matter your
operating system there's generally
enough around there as long as you can
get Adobe Photoshop and chrome yeah and
I would say for a game project that
you're hosting if if you already know a
bit about server-side stuff and you have
that kind of element to your game then
something like App Engine or ec2 or
compute engine would be a good way to go
depending on if you already have
experience with those things so so one
other question let me just jump forward
one we talked about this already yes
they're having some problems
Shawn's working on it yeah yeah let's
Shawn that's not ready by the end of the
week I would say no there hasn't been a
code freeze there's actually been a lot
of work on the back end yeah in the last
week I'd actually love to do a shout out
to two of our engineers in particular
Nicholas and Alvin who have been working
18-hour days ish to fix this we
basically Reese re-engineered the entire
back-end architecture for how these
things work in about a week's time so it
it stuff is happening what is the best
book or video intro for a J's game
physics yes so if you're interested in
so I'm gonna start with the word physics
and then work the word JavaScript in
there if you are learning about physics
follow a guy named Aaron kado CA tto
Google and he by and far is the largest
and most influential physics for game
development engineer in the world right
now he's the guy who wrote box
Toodee so if you find Aaron kado you'll
find all these good game developer
conference videos GDC videos on how we
put box 2d together then you'll find out
that there's a flash version of box 2d
an iOS version an android version and
also a JavaScript version now we
actually use the JavaScript version of
box 2d in grits and I think unit 7 will
actually cover how we go 6-hour unit
well actually talk about how we
integrate with that physics engine and
the things you need to know now if you
yourself are interested in writing
physics instead of using someone else's
engine I highly recommend a book called
physics for game developers it's from
the company that puts animals oh oh
right like oh right yes from O'Reilly
it's got like a leopard cat thing on the
front he's kind of like couched in a
physics e-type pose
yeah physics 'yes that'll work probably
but that's one of the best resources to
start off with that's gonna introduce
you to everything you need to know about
physics and and basically introduce you
to the fact that we're faking all of it
in video games it's not real physics by
any means of the term we're faking as
much as we can to make you think it's
real physics but other than that if you
really don't think that go back and look
at a game called Jurassic Park
trespasser back in the day there's
actually one of the first games to use a
full physics engine it was really cool
Velociraptor would run at you and you
could shoot the blocks out of something
and a building would fall from the
Velociraptor and it was like oh my god
this is a future and it was it was
really cool back then all right so we're
gonna have to wrap it up I'm gonna ask
to get one more question from here and
keep saying that just one more are you
going to address the wider concept of
game design continued and focus on game
coding I think there will be a lot of
little nuggets in there we have these
sort of that we have sketched out during
the development of the course it's
called the storytime with cult and
you'll see some crazy stuff coming up in
the next couple of units so you
definitely be on the lookout for those I
wish we had some of the blooper reels
well we'll see about the leftover maybe
sorry I would also say if you're
interested in more of the wider concept
of game design or anything like that
come here ask questions yeah right now
or on the one out or on the live stream
yeah that's this is if you're in Nevada
yeah
especially in the back alright so that
concludes the presentation we're going
to go through the remainder of the
questions I don't know how many more
there are on the live stream but we'll
go through them and we'll answer them
offline so if you your question their
specific question hasn't been answered
definitely stay on touch from that one
again one next Monday is the just the
same time in a different conference room
and we'll be here for a little bit too
to hang out I think there's still some
food in the back we really enjoyed it
and hope you you did - yeah thank you
okay thank you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
