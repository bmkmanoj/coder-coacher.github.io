fast easy and accurate to fill in which
is essentially all of form design so
I'll try to distill an entire book /
years worth of materials into a couple
minute answer but at the very highest
level when we have a series of questions
we need answered the process we should
start with is this thing that Caroline
Jarrett calls keep cut postpone or kill
I think is the right methodology I may
have one of those words wrong but keep
is this is information that's critical
required we've got to have it in the
form some work cut I guess that's the
one for kill cut means we actually don't
need it and it's surprising how many
times you can go and look at farms and
see things that are included in there
that nobody's actually even using you go
and talk to the team like Oh what are we
doing with this piece of data I don't
know because it's over here in this has
anybody looked at this in the past three
years no but we always collected this so
here it is so there's stuff you can cut
postponed is things that you can ask
later so there's a lot of information
that we force you to give us up front
which isn't applicable and actually has
a better time in place further down in
the flow so postponing questions until
they're appropriate is a really good
strategy as well and the last one is
explained and explained just basically
boils down to telling people why you're
asking for something or how they can
answer that question there's a case
study the beginning of my web form
design book where a major retailer a
huge e-commerce site had two options at
checkout one was log in and one was
registered it turned out you could
actually register without creating
account you can actually buy something
without making an account but it was
totally unclear from that language login
and register so that they did is they
change the label of the button that said
register to continue and they put a
little bit of text that says you do not
need an account to continue and
conversions went up something like
thirty percent they made 300 million
more a year overnight just from
explaining what they were actually
talking about so that keep cut postponed
and explained methodology is great at
the very highest level then when you go
deeper you get much more into
interaction design and visual
design considerations what's the right
input control for this type of question
how do I minimize typing mistakes how do
I bound people so they don't go into an
error state you can do that with things
like custom keyboards input types in
line validation there's a whole school
of methodology for the nuances of forms
but it all starts at that bigger picture
methodology of really thinking through
what should be there where and what you
need to tell people about the questions
you're asking them if that makes sense</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
