another look at math quo in the last
section we were able to type in
inequalities and interval notations for
our answers now we're going to try some
fractions internet fraction and math
quill is very similar to what you've
done in the past you're simply going to
type in the numerator then the forward
slash and then the denominator math
quill do all the hard work for you and
will make your fraction look nice but
sometimes we don't want just a fraction
sometimes you want a little bit more
after typing in a fraction you'll notice
that your cursor bar is in the
denominator to move this cursor bar from
the denominator simply hit the over
arrow key and it will shift back up to
the main line and now you're ready to
continue typing just like before you
would type X a plus sign and then one
and it turns out anytime you're typing
inside of a math code box you can just
use your arrow keys as navigation try
playing around with math quill and use
these arrow keys don't worry about
making a mistake because you can always
hit delete when you play around with it
you'll notice that the cursor bar will
move up and down inside of a fraction
you can be even hit the caret symbol and
then you can create an exponent cursor
we won't cover this now but if you want
to play around with it feel free to
we'll do this again later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
