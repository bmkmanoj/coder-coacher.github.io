summarize what we learned so far we've
learned some theory and some practice in
theory we've learned about patterns
which are grammars which describe
languages where a language is a set of
strings we've learned about interpreters
over those languages and about compilers
which can do the same thing only faster
in terms of practice we've learned that
regular expressions are useful for all
sorts of things and they're a concise
language for getting work done we've
learned that interpreters including
compilers can be valuable tools and that
they can be more expressive and more
natural to describe a problem in terms
of a native language that makes sense
for the problem rather than in terms of
Python code that doesn't necessarily
make sense we've learned functions are
more composable than other things in
Python for example in Python we have
expressions and we have statements they
can only be composed by the Python
programmer whereas functions can be
composed dynamically we can take two
functions and put them together or you
can take F and call G with that and then
apply that to some X and we can do that
for any value of F and G we can pass
those into a function and manipulate
them and have different ones applying to
X we can't do that with expressions and
statements we can do it with the values
of expressions but we can't do it with
expressions themselves functions provide
a composability that we don't get
elsewhere functions also provide control
over time so we can divide up the work
that we want to do in to do some now and
do some later and a function allows us
to do that expressions and statements
don't do that because they just get done
at one time when they're executed
functions allow us to package up a
computation that we want to do later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
