3 0 3 0 8 might receive IP address space
say 12.20 dot 249 / 24 from one of its
providers such as AT&amp;amp;T which happens to
own 12000 / 8 now in this case a s 3 0 3
0 8 wants to be multihomed in other
words it wants to be reachable by a to
upstream Internet service providers in
this diagram the two internet service
providers are AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon to be
reachable by both of these ISPs a s 3 0
3 0 8 has to advertise its prefix which
it received from AT&amp;amp;T
via both AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon the problem
occurs when AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon want to
advertise that prefix to the rest of the
internet well unfortunately although ATT
might like to aggregate this prefix as I
previously described it can't if it did
verizon would still be advertising the
longer / 24 via its upstream link and
because of longest prefix match all of
the traffic would then arrive via the
verizon link regardless of what a s 3 0
3 0 8 wanted to have happen to that
incoming traffic as a result both AT&amp;amp;T
and Verizon must advertise the same / 24
to the rest of the Internet this results
in an explosion of / 24 s in the global
Internet routing table you can imagine
that if a lot of stub a SS wants it to
be multihomed then suddenly we've got a
lot more / 24 s in the global routing
table then might otherwise exist without
multihoming</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
