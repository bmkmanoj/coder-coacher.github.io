study of distributed systems we have an
exciting field on a personal note I
started my academic career as a
researcher in distributed systems in the
mid 80s
part of the fun but there's a lot of
parallel between distributed systems and
parallel systems what fundamentally
distinguishes a distributed system from
a parallel system is the individual
autonomy for the nodes of a distributed
system as compared to a parallel system
and the fact that the interconnection
network that connects all the nodes in a
distributed system is wide open to the
world as opposed to being confined
within a rack or a room or a box however
as the feature size of transistors in
silicon continues to shrink due to
advances in process technology and
breakthroughs in VLSI technology many of
the issues that are considered to be in
the domain of distributed systems are
not surfacing even within a single chip
but I digress in this lesson we are
going to learn the fundamental
communication mechanisms and distributed
systems and what an operating system has
to do to make communication efficient as
in the previous lessons you will see the
symbiotic relationship between hardware
in the form of networking gear and the
operating system software stack
particularly the protocol stack to make
the communication efficient we'll start
this lesson module with a definition and
a shared understanding of what we mean
by distributed system but first a quiz
to get you started</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
