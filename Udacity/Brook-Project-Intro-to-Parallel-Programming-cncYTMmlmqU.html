known for when you were graduate
students is this Brooke Project so can
you tell us a little bit about that and
this was a very important step in sort
of the the progression of GPU computing
to something that we can do commercially
today
yeah when back in the DirectX 9 days of
the computer graphics GPUs started
becoming truly programmable people could
express real programs fairly short ones
maybe only for date instructions long
that can actually you know solve a
shading problem like face skin share
fairly complicated stuff a bunch of us
in academia noted noticed that the
performance of this GPS was huge
compared to CPUs of the day the number
of floating-point operations that you do
was an order of magnitude larger so we
studied and looked at how you could do
use GPUs for more general-purpose things
by hacking graphics API is electric text
the research well a lot of people show
that that was doable and it was really
hard really hard to program in fact you
needed a PhD in computer graphics to do
basic mathematical kind of stuff in fact
there are folks in finance that we're
hiring you know game programmers to try
to hack GPUs to solve financial problems
the research I did was basically study
the more fundamental programming model
around GPUs what was it about GPUs that
made them programmable and and in
parallel but also present a more
cohesive program model to general you
know programmer to let them think about
GPUs in more general way in the end the
project was called Brook it was an
actual software programming language for
how to program in a general way GPUs on
top of those existing graphics api's so
that users could think about more
general data concepts instead of
triangles and pixels and textures what
sort of things did people write in
Brooklyn we wrote a ray tracer to sort
of study a you know could could a GPU
actually implement a ray tracer which is
a fun thing because a lot of people said
it can be done we did triangle meshing
we did a lot of simulation and Grid
kinds of stuff thermodynamic problems
heat transfer problems flow fluid for
little kinds of problems for the most
part it worked it demonstrated the
the performance benefit it was still
early you know they weren't fully
general so you didn't have to work
around some of the hiccups but from a
research perspective it achieved its
goal showing the potential of GPU
computing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
