particular kind of function approximator
that we referred to as an average ER and
the whole class of average ER function
approximator z-- okay so this is a kind
of function approximator that was
actually or at least in this context
introduced by Jeff Gordon and when he
did it there was this sort of collective
head slapping that happened over the
entire community of reinforcement
learning researchers because it's just
it's so it was just so there it was so
beautiful and nobody saw it except for
him and so it really was at that time
the age of Gordon oh that's fantastic
so moving on so we're gonna introduce
this average errs concept in the context
of a simple example so imagine that what
we're trying to do is represent a
function over the line right so over the
over this one dimensional space so it's
going to be some kind of curve and the
parameters that we're gonna get to set
are the actual value of that function at
some particular point so at X 1 and X 2
and and X 3
we can you know move these up and down
these points and what we'd like is that
we define a function approximator so
that once we've defined these points the
rest of them will get kind of filled in
in a natural way let's say mm-hmm and
for the for this story to make sense
they're gonna have to somehow be related
to averaging sure how can we define the
value of points in between here between
x1 and x2 say we want to we get we want
to get the value of some point just
plain old X as a function of the value
at x1 and the value of x2 yeah so so
what would be a natural way to do that I
know you can say more than one if you
contain it sure there's lots of ways of
doing it but I guess the simplest one
would be just to take a weighted average
based on distance yes which is why you
know these things are called averages so
what we're gonna do is we're gonna say
okay the value of X I don't know what it
is but we're always going to make sure
it's I don't know so 0.8 times the value
of x1 which is which is a parameter plus
0.2 times the value at x2 which is
another one of our parameters
and that's because of the relative
distance between the X 1 and X 2 yeah so
it turns out it doesn't matter but that
is a very natural thing to do to kind of
do a linear interpolation and so what
that means is once you once you nail
down where X 1 X 2 and X 3 are the way
that it generalizes the way that it
fills in the rest of the function is
like you know the line segments mm-hmm
there's a bunch of other things you
could do and they're all ok as long as
what we do is is any point that we want
to define we define it as a convex
combination of the anchor points so the
anchor points are the ones that we get
to set as free parameters and the value
at any other state needs to be
expressible as a convex combination of
the anchor points so this doesn't really
tell us what should we do for like
beyond x3 for things that are out here
on the in the state space well that's
funny that's just what I was gonna ask
you what do we do for extrapolation
instead of interpolation yeah so this is
very interpretive is that a word it is
now interpretive it's sort of
interpolation related so the constraint
that we've got for it to be an average
err it needs to be that the value of any
point is the convex combination of a set
of anchor points so we get to define how
things extrapolate but it has to be the
case that for example for some point I
don't know X prime out here its value
needs to be defined in terms of these
black points in terms of the these other
anchor points whose values are gonna get
to be set so one natural thing would be
to say ok we're out to the right of x1
let's just set anything out here to be
the value of x3 sure so we've so we
don't really extrapolate so much as just
you know flick flatten it out on the two
ends so we don't get to kind of crazy up
or down from from where we were but
there's other things that we could do as
well you could also say that if you're
far enough away from the points then
it's gonna be the average there's a
straight-up average of these guys and as
you get closer it's gonna be more
influenced by the newer ones by virtue
of the fact that it's a convex
combination what does that tell us about
the value out here well it has to be in
between the highest and those values
that's for sure exactly
that's right so we're extrapolating but
we're not really extrapolating outside
of the data that we've got and this is
this is gonna be a really important
property these averages to make sure
that they're going to be well behaved
all right so that that makes sense so
far yeah do I have a good definition of
an average err whether you do</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
