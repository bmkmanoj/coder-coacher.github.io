it's best to work with lots of examples
let's try another example and again it's
a great idea if you can do this together
with me in bluej navigate to the
pictures project in lesson 2 and you
will see here an icon representing a
picture class let's make an object of
that class again I will accept the
default name and here is my object what
can I do with it
well you know how to find that out you
right-click on the object and you get a
list of things
let's tell you the methods let's pick a
method and in fact we will pick the
method call pick this particular method
opens up this file chooser here that
lists whatever image files happen to be
available you can also navigate to other
folders but we'll just pick one here
once you pick a file a window pops up
that shows the image now let's see what
else we can do let's call the pixels
method and it tells me that this
particular image has 104,000 976 pixels
ok that's potentially interesting over
here we have a method called translate
let's just play with it to see what it
does
it wants two numbers I will just put in
100 and 200 click on OK
and now look carefully at the planet as
you've seen it moved so the method is
not called translate because it it
doesn't translate this into Lithuanian
translation is a mathematical way of
saying moving and it moved it by 100
pixels in this direction and 200 pixels
in that direction so this is another
great example of an object the object
can do certain things the methods tell
you what it can do in the next exercise
you get to play with objects off the
picture class</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
