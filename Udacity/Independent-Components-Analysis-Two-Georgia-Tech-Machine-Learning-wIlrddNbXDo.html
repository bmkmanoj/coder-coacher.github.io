think the the best way to kind of see an
example here is to draw a little picture
for you that tells you what the sort of
underlying assumption behind ICA is so
here's the kind of at least the way I
see what the fundamental assumption of
ICA is and that is this you're assuming
that there's a bunch of things in the
world and these are going to be hidden
variables and they've got some
properties that that are associated with
them they're random variables they are
mutually independent of one another that
is if I know the value of one it doesn't
tell me anything about the value of the
other but we don't know what they are
and what we get to see our observables
and these observables are given rise to
by values for the hidden variables and
they somehow combine in a sort of linear
fashion and our job the job of any
learner in this case any unsupervised
learning this case is given your
observables try to find the hidden
variables under the assumption that
these hidden variables are in fact
independent of one another so what's a
concrete example that may give you a
concrete example that then I'm going to
give you a demo that we found on the web
ok ok so one problem where we know this
is true is something called the blind
source separation problem so what's the
blind source separation problem it also
has another name which is the cocktail
party problem do you remember the
cocktail party problem I think so yeah
so describe it to me so not that I go to
a lot of cocktail parties but if you're
in a large group of people like in a
cafeteria or something like that and
you're trying to listen to a
conversation it can be very challenging
because there's all these different
conversations happening simultaneously
mm-hmm and we need to be able to pull
out that one source that that we're that
we're caring about so that we can listen
to it while kind of separating it out
from what all the other noise sources
are so what you just described to me is
that somehow you have a bunch of people
so there's Charles there's a Michael and
there's pushkar and they're all talking
at once and let's imagine in place of
ears we have microphones and these
microphones are actually recording
everything that well
thing that they here so this means that
this first microphone is going to hear
me the second microphone is also going
to hear me and says the third microphone
however they're going to each hear me at
a slightly different volume at a
slightly different delay okay because
they're plays sort of randomly around
the room you with me I think so yeah
okay
similarly Michael who just keeps talking
and talking and talking mostly about
puns it's also going to be picked up by
each of the three microphones and
pushkar mainly complaining that we
aren't doing enough quizzes is also
going to be heard by the three
microphones in this case if you look at
our other examples the people are the
hidden variables that is they're the
things that are causing events to happen
in the world but what we have are
observables are the microphones and what
it is that they're recording now if
we're in a small enough room it turns
out that physics tells us that even
though our voices are all nonlinear and
sound doesn't travel in a very linear
fashion of the way that we would like it
turns out that in a small enough room
with all of the reflections and
everything each of these microphones are
well modeled as receiving some unknown
linear comment combination of all of the
sources so this means that each one of
these microphones actually contains a
different linear combination of each of
our voices okay you with me yes
interesting right and so really if I
were to give you these three recordings
and I wanted to figure out what's a
michael Lippmann was saying all that
information is here but I can't extract
Michael Lippmann from microphone one or
microphone two or microphone three but
given all of these microphones I can in
fact recover just Michael alone just
Charles alone or just push Carl own
because I see a exactly tries to find
this notion of mutual independence
without losing any information from the
output and this model here of three
people talking mostly independently and
being recorded by linear combination by
different microphones is exactly the
model that ICA was designed to represent
so just to sort of drive this home let
me give you an actual example that we
found on the web where they do exactly
this problem okay sure</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
