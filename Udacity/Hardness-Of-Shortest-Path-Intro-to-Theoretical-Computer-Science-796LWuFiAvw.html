bit further you can figure out a general
rule here and the general rule is that
if you have n vertices then the number
of different paths from A to B is 2 to
the power of n 1/2 minus 1 and the way
you can see that this formula is correct
is you can plug in the 4 here so it's 4
over 2 which is 2 minus 1 and 2 to the
power of 1 that is 2 and in the quiz we
just saw that each time we add two
vertices here we have to multiply by 2
and this is exactly what happens here's
because if we add two vertices here then
the exponent here will increase by 1 and
in this way you can work your way up to
larger and larger networks of this
structure so what you can see here is
that the number of ways to get from A to
B grows exponentially as these graphs
here get more and more vertices and I'm
now going to ask an algorithmic question
and the algorithmic question is a very
simple one and that is what is the
fastest way to get from A to B or the
shortest way to get from A to B and if
you have had an algorithms class you
might know that this is a problem that
can be solved in polynomial time so
there are many algorithms actually that
can figure out in polynomial time what
the shortest way is to get from A to B
but this means that having many possible
solutions cannot mean intractability
because here is a case where we do have
many possible solutions there are
exponentially many ways to get from A to
B but if we ask an algorithm to figure
out the shortest one for us
it doesn't obviously not have to
consider an exponential number of
solutions to come up with the answer
because otherwise there would be no
polynomial time algorithm to figure out
shortest paths between two points a and
B and so for vertex cover clique and
independent set this means that if we
want to show these problems to be
intractable it's not enough to point out
that there's an exponential number of
solutions because that does not mean
that there can be no polynomial time
algorithm</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
