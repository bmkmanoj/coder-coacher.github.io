quiz suppose we have a processor whose
voltage can be changed between 0.9 and
1.5 volts in 0.1 volt steps its
frequency can be changed between 1.8
gigahertz and 3 gigahertz
in 0.2 gigahertz steps but there is a
relationship between the voltage and the
frequency you have to use if we want to
use the lowest frequency setting our
voltage can be 0.9 volts if we want to
use the next frequency setting of 2.0
gigahertz then the voltage needs to be
1.0 volts for 2.2 gigahertz we need to
use one point one volts and so on and we
can only get the highest 3 gigahertz
frequency with the highest voltage of
0.1 volts so you cannot just lower the
voltage and increase the frequency if
you increase the frequency also have to
increase the voltage of course you are
allowed to use a 2 gigahertz frequency
setting with any voltage that is one
point zero volts or above so we could
for example do two gigahertz
and 1.5 volts although that's of course
gonna be less power efficient than using
the lowest voltage available for that
frequency let's say also that we have
measured the power consumption at 1 volt
and 2 gigahertz
this setting here and we have found that
the processor consumes 30 watts of power
the questions for you are what is the
power for the most power efficient
setting among these put your answer here
and what is the power for the highest
performance setting among these put your
answer here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
