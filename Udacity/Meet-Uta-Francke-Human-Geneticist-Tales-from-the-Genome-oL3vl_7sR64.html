originally from Germany as you can hear
and I'm emeritus professor here at
Stanford and also senior medical
director 23andme tell us when you first
fell in love with genetics and when you
started studying and sort of your
journey to where you are today as a
Stanford professor I went to medical
school in Germany and then I trained in
pediatrics I came to this country to
train at Los Angeles Children's Hospital
and then I had to think about what else
to do and what I really wanted to do was
endocrinology because I left
biochemistry I thought biochemistry was
the best thing in medical school but I
couldn't get in as a foreign medical
queria and genetics was just in the
beginning started to get interesting it
was at the time where it became possible
to identify chromosomes by a chromosome
banding and there weren't many people
going into that field which had a great
advantage because as a fellow at UCLA in
human genetics I was allowed to do
anything I could learn chromosomes
biochemical genetics as well as see the
patients on the wards where people said
Oh what is this my formation is it a
syndrome is a genetic will it happen
again so the training involved from the
beginning clinical genetics and did
other subspecialties of genetics were
you able to interact and I guess medical
school and beyond as you were sort of
discovering the area that you were sort
of going to focus on pork for genetics
at the same time were you able to
experience the clinical side of genetics
as well all the time I was active in
clinical genetics or the last thirty
something years and what does that
involve exactly well in pediatrics
you're mostly focused on children having
problems so either children who inherit
something or children who get very sick
after they are born because they cannot
metabolize protein there's something
wrong in their metabolism or children
who have certain birth defects children
who don't do while in school who I late
walking who relate acquiring skills or
have
our logical symptoms seizures so all
kinds of problems that people didn't
know what is this so there was a lot of
discovery to do we found out that
certain clinical phenotypes were
associated with chromosomal duplications
or deletions now that we could look at
chromosomes in higher resolution so that
was the first stage so in the 70s make
discoveries this way and now of course
whole genome sequencing is applied to
these children and when nobody had could
figure out what caused their problem you
look at the whole sequence and you can
find a change and that's been very
successful in the last couple years
since I high-throughput sequencing
methods were developed so the exciting
thing about my own career is a two-way
street it's always been to waste between
the clinic and the laboratory you see
somebody fascinating in the clinic and
you bring samples to the lab and you
tell your PhDs look this is what the
patient's look like and we have to
figure out what's going on here and that
gets everybody motivated when you learn
something in the lab you find a gene
like we found a gene for rett syndrome
and then you can figure out can we do
anything to help these patients now that
we have the gene we figure out its
function in the last few years we spend
a lot of time making mouse models
because we looked at diseases that
involve the central nervous system and
you can't go into a human brain and take
a sample I mean some people have part of
the brain removed because of some
medical indication and then of course
you can get it but what we did make
mouse models because the genome is very
conserved between the human and the
mouse and even though we working with
deletion syndromes were part of a
chromosome is missing we can define
where in the mouse genome that part is
located it's got the same genes in it
take it out in the mouse and then you
have my set you can study the
development prenatally afterwards takes
a brain cut it up look at what's going
on and this is what we did mostly in
while in this mill in your mouth what
would you
say is your general research subject
there were too many to mention I really
started out with whatever was possible
to do at the time you know I was in the
way driven by technology that was being
developed and I saw why this technology
could be applied to the problem so it
started with cytogenetics in the area of
banding chromosomes that was in the 70s
and then biochemical genetics somatic
cell genetics meaning that you can fuse
cells from different organisms and you
can map chromosomes so in the beginning
of the genome project we were very much
invested in mapping genes to chromosomal
regions with the idea if you have a gene
that's been cloned and you know the
function you map it to a chromosome
region where we already know a certain
disease gene has been mapped then
becomes a candidate gene for this
disease and that was a useful approach
in the early 90s and then as all these
other technologies became available to
study global gene expression patterns
and during mouse modeling and we then we
moved to studying individual diseases
like wet syndrome and Roberts and Roma
some information syndrome and ultimately
I sought the deletion syndromes where
you take out a chunk of chromosome and
would be interesting because there are
many different genes in here and which
of these genes contribute to what part
of the phenotype I found that
fascinating and this was the projects we
are working on in the end so it's a
stepwise process of discovery that makes
use of the technology as it is being
developed so thinking about what you do
as a career what do you think the future
is for people who are interested in
being clinicians and bridging the gap
between you know people and the research
that can help them do you think there's
going to be a bigger opening and in the
future for people who want to want to do
something similar to tweet well there
wasn't definitely
and there are many opportunities but the
drawbacks are in genetics for example we
don't have enough people coming into
Medical Genetics out of the bed is
inside because in genetics you don't
make any money we don't have procedures
we gon don't stick tubes into people
that we can charge for it's all
cognitive you know you spend a lot of
time going through complicated
information searching the literature
sitting down with the family counseling
them you don't get reimbursed much for
this and therefore it's not attractive
not if not for people who went to
american medical schools and to enter a
career of a medical geneticist so we
have a shortage and many of the most
successful people are foreign trained
medical medical doctors so don't have to
pay for their medical education we
hopefully have a very large
international audience you know
participating in our course what would
you say to a student or in a lifetime
learner who's watching and is really
interested in the subject may even be
interested in thinking about this as a
career what advice would you give them I
mean I can only say this has been a
lifetime learning experience to be part
of genetics during those decades when
everything developed and we are not done
yet I think it goes on and will be even
more exciting there are many secrets in
the genome that are yet to be unraveled
and both PhDs and MDS should consider
this and then genetic counseling that's
a whole new career path we have a
training program here at Stanford for
genetic counselors the master's program
because you don't have to have a PhD or
MD to tell people this is what we found
in your sequence and this is what it
means and these people are trained
specifically to do that and we'll need a
ton of lots of them so I want to
encourage people to consider this as a
career</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
