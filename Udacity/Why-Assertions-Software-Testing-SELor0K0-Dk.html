question why assertions and what our
assertions really buying US and the
Spoils down to three or four basic
reasons
so first assertions make code self
checking that is they make the code that
you write fail proactively when
something's wrong and this can lead to
more effective testing second assertions
make code fail early at a location that
is closer to the actual bug and so this
is more relevant to debugging than to
testing but it's generally the case that
debugging is a difficult backwards
problem where you're reasoning in a
backwards sort of a way about the saut
about the behavior of the software that
you wrote and the less steps there are
in one of these backwards chains the
better assertions really can help with
that
third assertions can help us assign
blame so it's often the case that
assertions live at interfaces between
different modules and in many cases it's
possible to look at where the bad values
came from that led to the assertion
failure and use that information to
assign blame to other models involved in
the call or to the other one a real
software testing exercises often lead to
difficult finger-pointing problems and
any tools that we have that allow us to
accurately assign blame to one or the
other of our software modules can be
valuable and final reason we like
assertions is because they allow us to
create executable documentation about
assumptions we've made about
preconditions in our code and so by
writing down executable checks on our
preconditions we not only get to check
these preconditions when the code runs
but also we're documenting for other
developers the things that need to be
true for that code to execute correctly
post conditions are things that are
supposed to be true after our code runs
and again in addition to creating
executable checks for these were also
telling other developers what we think
should be true and this should allow
other people to rely on these post
conditions and invariants are closely
related to preconditions and
postconditions these are things that
need to be true for example at every
iteration of a loop</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
