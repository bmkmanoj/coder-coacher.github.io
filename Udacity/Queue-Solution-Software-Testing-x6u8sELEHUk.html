test code for the cue glass so it
doesn't actually take a whole lot to get
full coverage on the cue class and
that's this is a good point we haven't
tested the cue a huge amount here it
shows a little bit of the problems with
especially just normal statement
coverage so let's go ahead and get
started so we start off with just a few
of size two we assert that it does
actually get made and then we call czech
rep we're going to be calling czech rep
after every single test that we do just
as a further test and really any of the
tests that we do that call the internals
of the q class should probably be in
czech rep because we don't necessarily
want our test code to have to worry
about the internals of it we want the
internal testing to be taken care of by
the class itself preferably although you
don't always get that but after that we
check the queue starts off as empty
which it should be and that the queue is
not full which it also should not be and
then we try to dequeue from the empty
queue and this should return on
according to the specification then
we're going to and q10 into the queue
and we should get a true result back and
Q returns true if you successfully and
do something false if it doesn't
correctly in queue for some reason or
another then we in queue 20 and again it
should be true now we check that it's
empty again it should not be empty and
we check that it's full since it's a
queue of size to the full method should
return true and that's what we assert
here now we further try to encule 30 but
since the queue should already be full
this should return false and we go ahead
and assert that now we try to DQ from
that and we should get 10 out since this
is a queue it's a first-in-first-out
data structure then we try to dequeue an
up again and we should get 20 out and
again after each of these we call czech
rep if i go ahead and submit this we see
that i got it right okay so that's one
way you could have done it there are a
number of different possibilities here
and like I said it doesn't really take a
huge amount of code to get full coverage
of the queue class in fact what I did
here is probably a bit much but again it
doesn't necessarily tell us a whole lot
about whether the queue classes in five
correct in any meaningful way so great I
hope you got that right and had fun with
it I hope it also wasn't too challenging
but I hope it made you think</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
