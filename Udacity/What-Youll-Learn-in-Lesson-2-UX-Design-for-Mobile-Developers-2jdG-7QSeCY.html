to get you to level up from an already
awesome developer to an even awesomer
design minded developer exactly so let's
start by reviewing what you learned in
Lesson one the first thing we learned in
Lesson one was we defined UX and
disambiguated it from UI then we gave
you an awesome visceral example of great
user experience I love that visceral
example and we also use two examples of
a sign-in form in a checkout form to
illustrate why it's bad to start with
detail first thinking it basically
causes you to only optimize locally yeah
exactly you end up creating some really
awesome forms but the overall
application might suffer and if you zoom
out you actually get an idea of what the
application should do and then you might
decide you don't even eat those forms
exactly and then we also learned a
technique called low res wireframing
which helps you think about your
application as a series of steps that
your user needs to go through to
accomplish a certain task so now that we
know that we're supposed to think in
this way where do we go from here what
do we do next
so in Lesson one we are really focusing
on the smartphone but now we're gonna
start focusing on the person so we need
to ask ourselves who is our end user or
who are we making this application for
so isabelle how do we focus on the user
and that's a great question and the
answer is all lie ahead in lesson two
where we're gonna talk all about how to
design for our end user before we get
started let's go over a quick overview
of what you're going to learn in lesson
two we're going to discuss two things
the first is how to design applications
for a specific type of user or a persona
and their use cases the second thing is
how to build a feature list that's
tailored for your persona and your use
case to make sure that your application
will really delight your user sounds
great Isabelle let's get started</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
