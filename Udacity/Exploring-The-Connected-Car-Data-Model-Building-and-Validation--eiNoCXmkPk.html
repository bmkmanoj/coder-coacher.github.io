connected cars data let's start with the
question what is the data collected by
the connected car to answer this
question we will take a look at some
aspects of the data as in the previous
examples we will be using the ipython
notebook from the instructors notes
please find the download links to the
ipython notebook and the data set that
we will use in this lesson and make sure
you have a file in it named connected
cars dot CSV launch the ipython notebook
and click on lesson for handout you
should see something like this on your
web browser screen let's look at the
first block of code here the first thing
we do is import the pandas library and
then we use the pandas library to read
the CSV file connected cars dot CSV for
the entirety of this lesson to run the
piece of code in that block we will use
the play button here you can also use
the enter and shift button together to
do the same let's run this piece of code
now the data has already been loaded in
a pandas dataframe the data frame is
called events we will use the described
method for the data frame to see what it
loaded here you will see a summary of
the data in a table this summary shows
that we have 128,000 561 events are
entries you can take a look at the
actual data by using the head method on
events the head method shows you what is
inside the data in this case we have
five columns in the first column we have
a driver ID the second column gives us
some values of x the third some values
of Y the fourth our dates on which these
values were taken and the fifth that
time at which these values were taken we
only see here the top five events
similarly we can try to use the tail
method on events let's see what happens
we see the same sort of data except now
the driver IDs RG you can see these are
the last five rows of the data set we
will quickly summarize the data we saw
that the data has IDs a2g it has some x
and y location or coordinates it also
has a date and time here we have a
scatter diagram to show you what the
data actually contains these are
coordinates of people driving around in
a connected car</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
