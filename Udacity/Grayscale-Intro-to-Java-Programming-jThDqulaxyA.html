record glorious color they only had gray
and sometimes we want to take a
photograph and turn it back into gray to
give it that old-fashioned effect now
you might think that all you'd have to
do is average the red green and blue
values but it's not quite that simple as
it turns out the receptors that we have
in our eyes have different sensitivities
to colors and what you actually have to
do is take the red green and blue values
weighted by these factors and then turn
them into gray and then when you're done
with that you can set red to this value
green and blue because they're all the
same that's what makes the color gray
and then you're done but we have the
same problem that you just saw red green
blue are integers these weighing
constants are fractional numbers so the
whole expression is a fractional number
and I want to put it back into an
integer so the solution is again to
inject a cast for this expression in
parentheses and put parentheses in
before that and then you get it
truncated down to the nearest integer
once again I'd like you to try that so
you can see it with your own eyes go
ahead again in the color class implement
a new method in this case it's the turn
gray method take the red green and blue
values combine them to a gray value
using the equation that you just saw
make sure that you get an integer and
then take that integer and put it back
into red green and blue go ahead and do
it now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
