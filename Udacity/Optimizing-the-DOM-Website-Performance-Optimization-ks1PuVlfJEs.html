can we start optimizing now yep let's
just focus on the steps before the
render tree construction so the DOM and
CSS song because those are usually the
steps that are the worst offenders and
make your page renderer very slowly well
we did talk about streaming HTML to the
client as fast as possible so the
browser can start building the dom is
there anything else so that's definitely
one what about the size of the HTML mmm
well I'm gonna go ahead and guess we
should keep it as small as possible
yep that's another good one let's take a
look at some strategies that will help
us with this let's say we want to
optimize the HTML file in front of us
the first thing to notice is that we
have CSS comments HTML comments and
JavaScript comments now these comments
are very helpful for developers but
guess what the browser is going to do
when it encounters them it's going to
ignore them exactly there's no point in
even shipping them to the browser we can
minify the file and reduce its size to
learn more about minification check the
link in the instructor notes
once you've done that you should also
compress the file and make sure they are
cached by the browser once again check
the instructor notes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
