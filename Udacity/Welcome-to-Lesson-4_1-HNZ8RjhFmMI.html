getting better and adding users is a big
turning point for the app
congratulations whoa Lyla you look
terribly tired is everything okay when's
the last time you slept yeah it's been a
while you're right we do have a lot more
user data now but I'm not sure it's
anything to celebrate I'm still
struggling with just exactly how to
implement sharing Walter asked for
sorting data and well that's pretty easy
to filter and sort our shopping lists as
it is it makes me think of bigger and
badder looming questions yeah what are
those I'm just I'm terrified about what
happens when we start getting thousands
of users I know too many users isn't a
problem right now heck it's even hard to
get my roommates and Nana to use the app
in its current state but the decisions
we make about data now will affect the
future our current model we made was
somewhat randomly put together without
any rigorous thinking about performance
I'm not even sure what the best way to
associate users and shopping lists is
yeah I could see how that could be
stressful why don't you walk me through
the exact kind of function I you're
working on and worried about hmm let me
pull the wire frames so we could have
the settings activity show different
sorting options and then on the items
page we could differentiate between the
bought items and the non bought items
the bought items would all be on the
bottom and crossed out instead of mixed
in randomly as for how the data the
firebase database itself should be
organized I just don't know finally I
want to implement some sort of sharing
functionality right now all the lists
are world viewable which doesn't make a
lot of sense when we get tons of users
what I'd like to happen is that the
users can make lists but they're private
until their shared with other users do
you know what the sharing flow will look
like so I was thinking something like a
user can add friends and then once a
friends is added they can click a little
check mark box to show whether the list
is being shared with that friend or not
and I was thinking of trying to filter
to allow for basic autocomplete
functionality
well the first part where you sort list
sounds easy firebase has some basic
filtering and sorting function i built
into it so you shouldn't worry too much
about that hmm so what do you think can
we tackle sorting I can make the UI
screens you know what why don't you take
it easy for a bit I'll chat with the
developer about sorting</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
