work together to manage your apps data
layer together these classes are known
as the core data stack the four parts of
the stack are one or more managed object
context s-- the managed object model the
persistent store coordinator and the
persistent container let's look at each
of these in turn
first your app will have one or more
managed object context s-- which are
instances of ns-managed object context
this is where we will work with
notebooks and notes these are managed
objects that is the subclass ns-managed
object the context is a sort of
scratchpad where we can create and
manipulate them temporarily when we're
done we can either save the changes to
the permanent store or roll them back
it's important to note that the changes
that we make in the context aren't
automatically saved to disk and don't
automatically update the UI also note
that working with managed objects is
different from working with regular
objects
you never instantiate a managed object
directly you always associate or
register it with a context so that the
context can manage any changes and
communicate them to the store on request
contexts and their manage objects are
the part of the stack that you'll
interact with most next up is the
managed object model or ns-managed
object model the managed object model
describes your data structure and
relationships you'll usually define it
using the data model editor in Xcode
just as we did in the last lesson that
model gets saved as an XC data model D
file in your project and compiled down
to an mo MD file that loads into your
app at runtime other parts of the stack
will ask the model for information they
need to do their work which brings us to
the third part of this stat
the persistent store coordinator or NS
persistent store coordinator the
coordinator connects to one or more
persistent stores and uses the model to
mediate between those stores and the
context that is it translates stored
records into managed objects and managed
objects into records the coordinator
speaks the language of the underlying
store such as sequel so that we don't
have to last but not least we have the
persistent container or NS persistent
container it does two things it helps us
set up the rest of the stack and
provides useful variables and methods
for working with contexts it was added
in iOS 10 to reduce the amount of
boilerplate required to set up the stack
and that's the core data stack these
four classes work together to manage and
persist the data layer so let's set them
up in muskan</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
