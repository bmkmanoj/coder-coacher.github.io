is do we disable assertions in
production code and so for example when
we run the Python interpreter with the -
Oh option which causes Python to enable
some optimizations it disables
assertions in order to make our code run
faster and so the question we're asking
here is is that a good thing and it
turns out their arguments we can make in
both directions so it's first look at
reasons why we might want to disable
assertions one of the main advantages of
disabling assertions would be that it
lets our code run faster another
advantage and here we're starting to get
into something which really depends on
what we're trying to do with our system
is the code running without assertions
is less likely to stop running so the
code keeps going even after some sort of
innocence some sort of condition is
found within the code the would have
triggered an assertion violation if
assertions had been it been enabled and
here we really have to ask ourselves the
question what is it that we're trying to
do with our system is it better to keep
going or is it better to stop and
remember that keeping going after some
condition is true that we lead to an
assertion violation may lead to a
completely erroneous execution on the
other hand possibly that's better than
actually stopping so now let's move to
disadvantages of disabling assertions in
production code so if our code happens
to rely on some side effect performed by
an assertion that is to say if whoever
wrote the code that we're using has
violated one of the rules for assertions
that I gave you then turning off
assertions is going to break the code
not only is it going to break the code
but it's going to break the code in the
extremely confusing way because lacking
assertions we're gonna have a very hard
time detecting the error except that is
probably going to cause our system to
crash in some confusing way or just to
do completely the wrong thing so this is
a real risk of turning off assertions in
large systems and the second reason is
even in production code it may be better
to fail early rather than keeping going
and really it just depends on what our
system is doing the question is do our
users want the system to die do they
want the system to give them some
completely wrong result</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
