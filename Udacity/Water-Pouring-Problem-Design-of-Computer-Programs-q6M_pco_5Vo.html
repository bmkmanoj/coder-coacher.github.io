problem known as the water pouring
problem here's what we're given is two
glasses of water and we have a faucet in
a sink which can be the source of as
much water as we want
now these glasses are of different sizes
I haven't drawn them that much different
but this one is four ounces and this one
is nine ounces for those of you in the
rest of the world besides the u.s.
announces about 30 milliliters our goal
is to measure out a specific amount of
water and what we want to have is six
ounces of water measured out so six
ounces won't fit in this glass so the
idea is at the end we want to have this
glass filled with exactly six ounces of
water and there's no gradated markers
it's not like a graduated cylinder or a
measuring cup where we have the
measurements on the glass and it
wouldn't be accurate enough to just
eyeball it so what we've got to do is
we've got to figure out how to do that
by measuring out precise amounts into
the cups and pouring them off for
example if the goal had been five ounces
then that would have been easy we just
fill the nine ounce all the way up to
the top and then pour the nine ounce
into the four ounce until the four ounce
is all the way full and then what would
be remaining here because there's nine
altogether would be five in this glass
so five ounces is easy six ounces it's
not as obvious how to get there so the
puzzle is to find a sequence of pouring
actions and the pouring can be from one
glass to another you can go in the other
direction it can go from the faucet into
each of the clap glasses and it can go
from the glasses down the drain so six
different actions we can take and we
want to find a sequence of actions that
arrives at this goal of six ounces and
of course we can generalize the problem
and put any number rather than nine four
and six so as usual let's make our
inventory of concepts that we're going
to be dealing with
we have the glass and the glass has
capacity and a current level so this
glass would have capacity nine current
level five we are also going to need a
collection of glasses probably a pair of
glasses and I guess we can say that the
pair of glasses and their current levels
that represents a complete state of the
world so we'll think of that as a state
of the world everything we need to know
about where we are in the problem then
we have the goal that we're trying to
reach we have the pouring actions 1 2 3
4 5 6 and that breaks down into emptying
filling and transferring and the
transferring I think is a little bit
tricky because there's two ways to do it
when we were transferring from the 9
ounce into the 4 accounts so we transfer
from X to Y we can do that until Y is is
full that's what happened here the 4
ounce was full or we could do it until X
is empty if we were started to pour back
4 ounces from here into an empty one we
could do it until it was empty so
anything else in the in the inventory oh
well we certainly need a notion of a
solution a solution is going to be
sequence of steps do pour from here to
here then from here to the drain then
fill up then pour again and so on and so
what this unit is really all about is
techniques for finding these solutions
which are sequences of steps and again
we're always talking about managing
complexity in this in this class so the
complexity where we're trying to manage
here is a complexity that comes when the
sequences are long</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
