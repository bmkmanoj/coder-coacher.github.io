of design principles is Arthur il whose
book is titled design heuristics
referenced on the class resources page
here are some examples of Ryles
heuristics you will notice the overlap
with some of the principle principles
that we have already talked about these
particular heuristics don't have names
that are catchy like the law of Demeter
but they do exhibit advice to you about
situations that you want to avoid or
ways of structuring your code that you
want to try to promote first one is most
of the methods define on a class should
be using most of the data members of the
class most of the time otherwise there's
an opportunity to split the class into
pieces that into individually obey this
principle another Ryle heuristic check
constraints and constructors rather than
in method preconditions for possible
following this principle reduce the
overall amount of checking that needs to
be done by the class another heuristic
factor the commonality of data behavior
and interfaces as high as possible in
the inheritance hierarchy thereby
facilitating reuse this of course is
standard low dogma here's another Ryle
heuristic inheritance should be used
only to model a generalization higher
grade hierarchy and not to facilitate
the sharing of implementation code we've
heard this one many times in this course
another prefer composition which we can
also think of as aggregation or
delegation over inheritance particularly
with respect to implementation
inheritance another it should be illegal
for a derived class to override a base
class method with a no op method that is
essentially a method that does nothing
instead of the behavior that the base
class prescribes doing so by the way
would violate the substitution principle
that we saw earlier Ryle also suggests
that we not change the state of an
object without going through its public
interface doing so would violate
information hiding if we kind of extend
this idea to deal with subclassing and
we strictly obeyed it this heuristic it
would mean that a method in a class
cannot change an instance variable
without calling the setter method in
that class that is you couldn't make a
direct assignment to an attribute you
have to call the setter which did it
another rile principal users of a class
must be dependent on its public
interface but a class should not be
dependent on its users finally here are
two Royale heuristics indicating how you
should distribute key design knowledge
among the components of a system
distribute system intelligence
horizontally as uniformly as possible
that is don't artificially concentrate
knowledge in one place this heuristic is
sometimes expressed as do not create God
classes or God objects in your system a
corollary heuristic is to distribute
system intelligence vertically down
narrow and deep containment hierarchies
you I encourage you to have a look at
Ryan's book where there's many more such
pieces of advice</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
