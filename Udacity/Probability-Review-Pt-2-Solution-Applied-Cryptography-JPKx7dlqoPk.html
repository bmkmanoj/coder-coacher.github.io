nine nine eight and there are two ways
to solve this one is to sum these two
not too hard to do the other way to
solve it is to use the complementary
event property which makes the math a
little easier in this case and that
property is that we know the sum of all
possible events has to be one so instead
of computing P valid by adding the
property probabilities of heads and
tails we can compute it by subtracting
from one the probability of the events
not invalid which is the probability of
e which is zero point zero zero zero
zero zero two so that would get us the
same answer the property that we're
using to do this is the complimentary
event property what it states is that
for any event a the probability of that
event and the probability of the
complement of that event that is of that
event not happening is equal to one and
what the not a here means is the
elements in the universe - the elements
in a so this is set subtraction we can
think of that like this so this is our
universe if we have some and then a
whole outcomes that are not part of a
must be the complement of a and that's
what you get by removing a from the
probability set</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
