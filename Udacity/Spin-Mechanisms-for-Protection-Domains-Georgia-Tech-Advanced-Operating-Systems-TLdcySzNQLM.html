create protection domains and use them
the first one is of course the create
call that allows creating a logical
protection domain and this mechanism in
spin allows initiating an object file
with the contents and export the names
that are contained as entry point
methods inside the object to be visible
outside that's what this create call
supported by spin provides to a service
creator for example if I'm creating a
memory management service I can write
the entry point functions in my memory
management service and export the names
using this create mechanism that's
available in Spain the second mechanism
in spin is resolving names if one
protection domain wants to use the names
that is there in another protection
domain the way it can accomplish that is
by using this result primitive that's
available in spent this is always very
similar to linking to separately
compiled files together that a compiler
does routinely so you may be very
familiar with the compilation process
where you may separately compiled files
and once you have done the separate
compilation of the files then you go
through a link phase of the compiler
where the linker resolves the names that
are being used by one object file with
the names that are defined in another
object file that's the same thing that
the resolve mechanism of spin does is it
resolves the names that are being used
in source which is a logical protection
domain and the target which is another
logical protection domain as a result of
this resolve step the source logical
protection domain and the target logical
protection domain are dynamically linked
or born together and once bound together
accessing methods
that are inside this target protection
domain happens at memory speeds meaning
it is as efficient as a procedure call
once the resolve step has happened as I
mentioned before to reduce the
proliferation of small logical
protection domains you may want to
combine protection remains to create an
aggregate larger protection domain and
spin provides a mechanism for that which
is the combined mechanism once the names
in a source and target logical
protection domain have been resolved
they can be combined to create an
aggregate domain and the aggregate
logical protection domain will have
entry points which is the union of the
entry points that were exported as names
from the source and the target or any
number of such domains that have been
combined together to create an aggregate
domain so this combined primitive in
spin is mainly useful as a software
engineering management tool to combat
the proliferation of many small domains
so once again the roadmap for creating
services is write your code as a modular
3 program with well-defined entry points
and using the spin mechanism of create
you can instantiate a service and export
the names that are available in that
service and if another logical
protection domain wants to use the names
that are exported it can do so by using
the spin mechanism resolve that causes
the dynamic binding of the source and
target logical protection domains and
finally the combined primitive allows
aggregation of logical protection
domains to create an aggregate domain
that's the union of all the entry points
that are available in the component
logical protection domains this is it
this is the secret sauce in spin to get
protection and performance while
allowing flexibility everything hinges
on the strongly typed nature of the
programming language that is being used
for implement
the operating system that is the
language allows compile time checking
and run time enforcement of the logical
protection domains that's the key to the
success of this approach to providing
flexibility protection and performance
