about a lot of the details on this
though it is it's just a great example
of reinforcement learning applied to a
difficult problem and clever engineering
tricks the the one thing that's that's
worth noting is that in addition to
using deep nets which are kind of in
vogue at the moment they also did a
couple other things in changing the way
that training happened that I think
we're really really important for
getting the kinds of results that they
got and so it wasn't just a matter of
hey let's just use deep Nets it was like
deep Nets plus really careful training
so that you don't get these kinds of
catastrophic death spirals like again
what my students and I have tended to
see when we try this stuff so this kind
of doesn't work successes story is not
really the end of the story in the sense
that well so we assign some some reading
I think these were reading associated
with this current lesson and three
papers tesaro Boyan and more and Sutton
which kind of tell an interesting story
which is I think a really nice summary
of what the the state of the art is here
so Jerry tesaro got TD gammon to work
really well so that's a three layer back
prop net for learning to choose moves in
backgammon and it worked great so
everybody thought hey everything works
great so then boy in and more wrote a
paper where they showed that there's
some very simple examples where things
ought to work well but they need not
they can actually work extremely poorly
using this this general approach of
substituting in a function approximator
for Q function can lead to terrible
results so it need not work then Sutton
had a reply to that where he published a
paper that said yeah but you can you can
do it if you do it right so he actually
replicated this the same results that
boy in and more showed not working and
showed that if you change the way the
training happens you could get those
particular things to work but this
really is just the argument is it need
not work but it need not not work which
is not really a very strong kind of
guarantee it's not like it has to work
or it has to not work so this is kind of
where we are now in terms of our
understanding so what's the Pollock
thing at the bottom Pollock oh sorry so
yes I just wanted to point out that why
did back emin work so well it might not
have just been the fact that it was
reinforcement learning it might have
been well back emmons kind of a good
thing to learn this way so Jordan
Pollock had a paper where he showed
at genetic algorithms can also do
particularly well in backgammon in
particular so it might not have been
that Jerry tesaro discovered that TD is
really great he might have discovered
that back at this really great as a
testbed 48 oh yeah I remember that in
fact the argument that a Jordan made was
that because it's so random it forces
you to do all kinds of exploration and
keeps you from falling into certain
traps that made generalization powerful
and in fact if we compare to Isabel's
master thesis work on something that you
thought was simpler like tic-tac-toe it
actually doesn't do terribly well on
tic-tac-toe and that's because it's so
deterministic there's huge chunks of the
state space you kind of never see even
when you're trying to do this
generalization yeah okay so I would
summarize that by saying that nearby
states in tic-tac-toe don't necessarily
have nearby values right you just move
one x to a different place on the grid
and the whole gameplay is very very
different back emmitt because it has
such a tremendously influential random
component if you move one piece it can
change things but it's not going to
change things you know night and day
it's going to change things gradually
and so that kind of gradual pneus means
that function approximation is probably
gonna well it could at least work out
well maybe it's certainly a good
argument</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
