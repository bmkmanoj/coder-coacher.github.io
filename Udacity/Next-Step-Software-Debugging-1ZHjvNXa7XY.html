first we split the input into n sub sets
where initially n has a value of two
second if removing any of these subsets
fails proceed with this very subset this
is what we have for our input we split
the input into initially two subsets and
if any of the subset fails as a near
will proceed with this very subset
otherwise we simply go and increase the
granularity that is we double the number
of subsets and we go again to step one
let's try this out on our input over
here so at this point we already tried
out removing the second half of the
input and removing the first half of the
input neither removal of the subset
would fail so now we have to increase
the granularity by coming up with now
four subsets this is a ten character
input so each of our subsets will have
between two and three characters for a
change let's try removing the first two
characters well no select tag no failure
we put them back and remove the next
three characters still no failure which
gets us an SCT tag no failure now again
we remove the next three characters CT
and the greater tag no selecttech no
failure and now we remove the last two
characters at this point we have the
selecttech by itself and again we have a
failure so what should we do in this
case should we now go and start again
with two subsets that is setting n 22 or
should we go and set n to the number of
subsets we had before minus 1 because
there's one less experiments show that
it's best to stick with a granularity
you once have achieved because then you
won't have to track back through all the
levels of granularity you already have
seen so we set n to n minus 1 which
means that in our case we would have
three subsets however we don't want n to
become less than two because otherwise
we just have one subset so we set n to
the maximum of n minus 1 and 2 such that
n can never fall below 2 so this point
our input is
the Select tag it fails and the number
of subsets is 3 what is it that delta
debugging would do next according to
this description of the algorithm and
what is the next test the Delta
debugging has to conduct is this the
Select tag as a whole is this the Select
tag with the second half removed is this
the Select tag with a first third
removed or is this just CT that is the
last third of the input over to you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
