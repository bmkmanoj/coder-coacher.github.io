yeah I just overflow yes and you've had
kind of an interesting path to get there
so tell us a little bit about your
background so my background is actually
not computing I believe I've never had a
computing class in my life which was not
necessarily claim to fame but my
background is actually fluid mechanics
and plasma physics
so from engineering days it turned out
that you can't do physics without
computing when I graduated in 96 the the
whole world was already moving towards
that kind of like computing and science
connected but you know I was I was young
and it seemed much more interesting to
go and write computer game so I went
wrote computer games for a while when
worked for the military and
high-performance computing when it'll
work for a bunch of startups and somehow
me ended my way around to Nvidia</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
