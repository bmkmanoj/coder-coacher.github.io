move the move and quiz we have this code
and we want to do if conversion of it so
that we get a branch free code that does
the same work if conversion amounts to
doing the work of both paths both the
not taken and the taken path and then
selecting between the two and correcting
the results so that only one of them is
active so what we have done is these two
instructions are already doing the work
of the not taken path it's just that
instead of in our tool which would
permanently modifier to we're putting
the result in our for and here the taken
path are three and one or added and we
put result in our five instead of our
three so what now
needs to happen is if this was the
correct path to take then our two should
get the result of our four otherwise our
three should get the result from our
five this is a branch on equal 0 r1 so
if R 1 is not equal zero meaning move n
on r1 used as a condition we're going to
be moving our 4 into r2 if the branch is
branching then R 1 is 0 and in that case
we want to be moving our 5 into r3 and
this is our if converted code that has
four instructions worth of work but no
branches in them in contrast the
original code has three instructions
worth of work in this path and two
instructions worth of work in this path
but it has this branch that might be
difficult to predict</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
