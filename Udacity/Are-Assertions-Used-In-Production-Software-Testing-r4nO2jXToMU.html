do real developers put assertions into
the code that they write and it turns
out that often they do and so I took a
quick look at the GCC and the llvm code
bases and so GCC is the GU new compiler
collection it contains not only the sort
of well-known c compiler and c++
compiler but also a java compiler and
eight a compiler in a number of other
tools and the GCC source code base
contains more than 9,000 assertions that
the LLVM compiler suite contains about
13,000 assertions and that's over about
1.4 million lines of code for a total of
about one assertion 410 lines of code
and here I'm just counting raw lines of
code not source lines of code so this
includes blanks comments and everything
and so what this tells us is that the
llvm and GCC developers have made a
pretty serious commitment to checking
assumptions preconditions post
conditions and invariance in the code
that they wrote and one thing that I've
done personally is reported a lot of
compiler bugs to both the GCC and lvm
products and one thing I've learned is
that much of the time these bugs show up
as assertion violations not always
sometimes these compile a segfault to
have other problems but most of the time
their assertion violation so these
assertions are actually succeeding at
accomplishing the goals that we talked
about on the left side of this screen
