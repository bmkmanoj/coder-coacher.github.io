laughing already because you can tell
it's Friday today we're going to start
on just a couple of lectures that are
could be labeled other stuff you should
know it's just things that come along
and computer vision that are relevant
some of them are very old some of them
are new some of them seem trivial so we
don't even teach about them normally and
yet if you don't know about them you're
totally mystified when somebody talks to
you about them and what we're going to
talk about today is a little bit about
color now I had a rest a little bit with
exactly how to do this because my own
background color really came through
psychophysics psychologies my my degree
was in brain and cognitive sciences so
and I think of color as a psychophysical
or perceptual phenomena that is when you
see this thing and you say oh that's a
light blue shirt that's actually not a
physics statement it's a psychophysics
statement so I'm actually going to start
their we're going to talk about just a
little bit about actually an anatomy and
then we'll move on to a little bit of
computational elements having to do with
color so and also in a few more lessons
you're going to see some just a few of
these slides and discussions again
because we're going to talk about the
human vision system but I need to just
talk about a little bit of it now and in
particular I have to talk about your
retina well and my retina and
everybody's right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
