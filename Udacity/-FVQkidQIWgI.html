code and this time I'm gonna do
something new now because this class
child inherits from class parent this
method show info is also inherited now
this means that instances of class child
instances like Miley Cyrus they can also
call the show info method even though
this method is not explicitly defined
inside class child let me do that next
so the first thing I will do is
uncomment this line of code where I'm
creating the instance called Miley Cyrus
and then use that instance to call the
method show info there now because I
want to focus on the output of this show
info method I'm going to comment out the
previous show info method for now there
now before that on this program I want
to highlight one more time that I'm
using the instance Miley Cyrus to call
the method show info now this method
does not explicitly exist inside class
child but because class child inherits
from class parent this method show info
is actually available to the instances
of class child so let me go ahead and
save and run this program
and there's my output the program did
not throw any errors and the last name
and I color of the instance Miley Cyrus
did get printed out okay so the next
thing I'm going to do is create a method
called show info inside class child and
see what that does
so I'm gonna create a new method called
show info inside class child now this
method show info is going to print out
the three things associated with a child
its last name I color and number of toys
here we are printing the last name of
the child now we are printing the
child's eye color and finally we're
printing the number of toys in order to
print this number correctly we had to
wrap it around the string function now
if I save and run this program my
hypothesis is that when I call the show
info method using Miley Cyrus which by
the way is an instance of class child
this show info method is going to get
called and not the show info method in
the class parent so let me save and
on this program and there's the output
we are printing out the last name I
color and number of toys of the instance
of class child so really what we have
done here is defined a method by the
same name show info inside class child
and also inside class parrot this
ability of a subclass in this case the
class child to override a method that it
inherited from its parent class is
called method overriding in programming</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
