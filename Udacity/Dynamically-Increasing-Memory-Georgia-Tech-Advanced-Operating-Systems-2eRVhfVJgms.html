how can we dynamically increase the
amount of physical memory that's
available to a particular operating
system running on top of the hypervisor
as I mentioned memory requirements tend
to be bursty and therefore the
hypervisor has to be able to allocate
real physical memory or machine memory
on demand to the requesting guest
operating systems on top of it let's
look at this picture here let's assume
that this is the total amount of machine
memory that's available to the
hypervisor and the hypervisor has
divvied up the available machine memory
among these two operating systems so the
house meaning the hypervisor
has no spare memory at all it is
completely divided up and given to these
two guys what if the Windows operating
system experiences a burst in memory
usage and therefore it's requiring more
memory from the hypervisor it may happen
because of some resource hungry
application that have been started up in
Windows maybe a video streaming
application that is gobbling up a lot of
physical memory and therefore when those
needs more memory and it comes to the
hypervisor asking for additional
hardware resources but unfortunately the
bank is empty what the hypervisor could
do is recognize that well maybe this
operating system doesn't need all of the
physical resources they allocated it so
I'm gonna grab back a portion of the
physical memory that Linux has and once
I get back this portion of physical
memory that I previously allocated to
Linux I can then give it to Windows to
satisfy its sudden hunger for more
memory well this principle of robbing
Peter to pay Paul can lead to unexpected
and anomalous behavior of applications
running on the guest operating system as
Saylor approach of course would be to
coax one of the guest operating system
in this case perhaps Linux to give up
some of
it's physical memory voluntarily to
satisfy the needs of a peer that is
currently experiencing memory pressure</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
