and install containers but i'm going to
show you that you can also use docker as
a build environment first let's build
our application you may have already
done this in a previous lesson I'm going
to make a new directory to hold our
source code then I'm going to change
into that directory and clone the
example application with the source code
in place we're ready to build our
monolithic app from lesson 1 after
that's built we're finally ready to
create a container for our app will
start by looking at our docker file for
the monolith on this line we're copying
over the model if built artifact from
the go build command earlier the next
line is where we declare our entry point
for the container which will be the
monolith app so with the dockerfile and
a mild with binary in place we are ready
to build a model of docker image will
use the darker bill command to upload
our bill context to the remote dr. Damon
which will execute the darker bill
commands listed in the docker file this
will reproduce an image for the monomyth
application now that the darker build is
complete use the docker images command
to list a monolith image let's make sure
the model of image is good by using the
darker run command to create a container
from it now that we have a running model
of container use a doctor inspect
command to grab its IP address and now
we're ready to test the model of
container using the curl command it
works as you can see building container
images are a breeze when using docker
files and the docker bill command</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
