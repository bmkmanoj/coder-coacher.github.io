and what I've decided is I'm going to
represent blank tiles by the lowercase
letter as long as I can and keep it in
there up to the moment when I place them
on the board here's the list of points
that we had before the points dictionary
originally had a value of zero for the
underscore character I've taken that out
because I'm not going to use the
underscore character I'm going to sort
of immediately translate the underscores
into a lowercase letter so I have to
figure out what are my lower case
letters I get them by lower casing the
letters i already had and then i went
through the lower case letters and i
said the point value of a lowercase
letter of a blank used as that lower
case letter is 0 updating the points
dictionary and now my plays are going to
be words that include lowercase letters
in them so the best play might be
something like this where we have the
score the location the direction and the
word includes a lowercase letter and
because I've taken that approach and
because I've defined the value of a to b
0 it turns out I don't have to change
calculate score at all i can leave that
alone and the only things i need to
change our fine prefixes and add
suffixes so let's look at fine prefixes
a lot of it is the same but there's two
places where i make a change so first
here before i was checking to see if the
input pre was a member of words or a
member of prefixes here i create the new
variable capital pre and ask is that in
the words because the thing i'm going to
be passed in could look something like
that it could have a lowercase a in it
and that's not going to be in my
dictionary of words and so i have to
uppercase it before i can test so like
before I test to see if I'm in the words
and then if I have a good prefix then I
go through my letters in the hand and
here's the second change if the letter
is a blank then I go through all the
possible lowercase letters and try to
find a prefix by replacing the letter in
the taking out the blank from the hand
and adding on the letter C onto the
prefix otherwise I just do what I did
before if it's not a blank I remove the
letter L and add it on to the prefix so
that's fine prefix
very simple change and now for ad
suffixes again to see similar changes
just like we saw before so we have to
when we're looking up in the dictionary
we have to look up uppercase version of
the prefix rather than the original
prefix and we're going through the hands
first we have to say is the letter one
of the possibilities one of the
allowable results for the anchor if
that's the case then go ahead and just
use it otherwise if we have a blank
anywhere in the hand then it's possible
to use that at this point we consider
all the possibilities that might occur
in this point so before we iterated over
the letters in the alphabet here we're
iterating over the possible acceptable
letters that the blank could stand for
and for each of them take away the blank
ad on the prefix but make it be
lowercase to indicate that this is going
to be represented by a blank and let me
just reformat that because it's going
