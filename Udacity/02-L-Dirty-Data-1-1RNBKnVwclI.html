data is data that contain some kind of
errors in them or are in a format that's
unfriendly or unusable you'll need to
spend time cleaning dirty data to make
sure you get a correct answer during
your analysis for example if we want to
count customers but some of these
customers are represented in duplicate
records then we'll need to fix this
before counting them up or we'll get an
inaccurate count as we start digging
into data we may come across many forms
of dirty data think about the way that
data is captured by companies some of
its entered manually and some part of
that data will always be suspect because
of well human error let's look at a few
examples of dirty data how many times
has your name been spelled wrong on a
piece of mail you've received that was
probably caused by a typo when someone
manually entered your name how about
when you get two pieces of the same junk
mail that's a problem with duplicate
records for the same person what about
when you get a piece of mail address to
someone who used to live at your address
well that's also a form of dirty data
because it's not accurate and that
person has moved on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
