our data and it's clearly non normal or
we use a statistical tests like the
Shapiro Wilk test and find that our data
is not normal that way is there anything
we can do well first off there's some
math that says that we have enough data
if we have you know a large enough
sample size we can actually use tests
that assume normality for example the
t-test even when our data is not normal
but there also exist nonparametric tests
that we can use to compare two samples a
nonparametric test is a statistical test
that does not assume our data is drawn
from any particular underlying
probability distribution one such test
is the mann-whitney u test which is also
sometimes referred to as the
mann-whitney wilcoxon test this is a
test of the null hypothesis that two
populations are the same again I don't
want to go too in depth into the theory
of how this test works but I did want to
tell you that things like this exist and
show you that this test can also easily
be implemented in Python using sy PI
we'd simply say U and P are equal to CI
dot stats dot mann-whitney u and provide
as arguments are two samples which we'll
call here x and y this function will
return you the mann-whitney test
statistic as well as P which is the
one-sided p-value for this test the
p-value here again acts as it did for
the T test
note that the mann-whitney u test simply
tests whether or not these samples came
from the same population but not
necessarily which one has a higher mean
or a higher median or anything like that
because of this it's usually useful to
report mann-whitney u test results along
with some other information like the two
sample means or the sample medians or
something like that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
