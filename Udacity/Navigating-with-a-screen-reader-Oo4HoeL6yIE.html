screen reader called voiceover voiceover
is a speech software that allows people
who are blind or visually impaired to
read information on the screen
voiceover is built into Mac OS 10 so
it's available on every Mac computer we
will start by turning voiceover on the
great thing is that because it's a
built-in software there is a global
shortcut key which is available to users
to use at any point to turn voiceover on
we'll press command f5 and then we'll
use the same shortcut key to turn it off
so let's start by turning voiceover on
voiceover on Chrome Google window google
HTML content has keyboard focus you can
refer to instructor notes for a full
list of available shortcut keys the next
thing I would like to do is to set up
voiceover for my needs I would like to
open voiceover control panel spotlight
spotlight system dialog spot v.o e r x
voiceover utility the Chrome Google
voiceover utility voiceover utility
window I want to show you how to adjust
speech rate for voiceover first I'll
show you the speed that I normally use
in my daily computing tasks and then
we'll switch back to the normal speech
rate verbosity speech leaving table
Knute speech lunch Alex default for five
content selected default rate edit text
default rates never rate 50% fifty
fifty-five percent seven percent seventy
five percent so this is my speech rate
however most people when they hear it
they say it's too difficult for them to
understand because the voice is speaking
just too fast so to make things a little
bit easier on you I'm going to switch
back to the default speech rate thirty
five fifty percent forty five percent
the next setting I want to change is the
setting that's responsible for providing
a summary of a webpage when it loads in
order to do that I will switch to the
web category notice one thing that as I
navigate through the list of categories
I use keyboard exclusively so
in this instance I'm just going to shift
tab for five Alex muted speech uncheck
checkbox choices utility categories
table once the age you listen I'm going
to arrow down to the web category
navigation web and then tab again to the
setting that I want leaving cell
navigation page loading tap selected
page loading speed web page summary when
loading a new web page so the setting I
want so I'm going to check it check
speak web page summary when loading a
new web page check box and now I'm ready
to go back to Chrome and begin web
browsing Chrome Google window Google
HTML content so now we're going to go
and actually browse the web I would like
to go to Wikipedia website so in order
to do that I'll press command l open
location HTTP slash slash takes me to
the address bar selection and period oh
okay I parry G Google an HTML content
Wikipedia wikipedia the free
encyclopedia page has 351 links 15
headings for form controls six tables 14
landmarks you notice how voiceover spoke
the page summary it told me how many
headings links and four fields and
tables are on a page and that's the
setting what turned on just a minute to
go if you remember every time I start
browsing a new web page or even the
pages that I I already know about I
start looking for headings to make it
easier for me to navigate through the
page a voiceover has a tool called web
rotor which allows me to see how many
headings browse through them and choose
the ones that I actually would like to
navigate to to start web browser I press
ctrl option you headings menu as you can
see there are quite a number of headings
on this page so when I arrow up and down
I'll hear things like heading level 2
from today's featured article heading
level 2 did you know
heading level 2 in the news heading
level 2 on this day one thing to notice
here is that the order in which I see
headings with voiceover is different
from the order you see them on the way
Paige in other words my order is more
logical and the order you see on the
page is more visually arranged this is
the decision that Wikipedia authors have
made another thing to notice here is
that voiceover speaks the heading level
number every time I arrow to a
particular heading heading heading level
which the languages heading level 2 had
padding level 3 Prince logic for 3 and
there could be more level of the heading
indicates how prominent it is on the
webpage so for example these sections
here the heading level 2 today's
featured have higher importance than the
heading level 3 think of it as sections
and subsections of a web page so if you
find a heading of level 3 underneath the
heading of level 2 it indicates that
this is a subsection of a section of a
web page so I would like to search for a
heading that says something about
featured so what I'm going to do is I'll
just type a few letters and let
voiceover find that heading for me for
items three items three items three
items patty padding level two from
today's featured article oh yeah from
today's feature article that's exactly
what I wanted so I'm going to press
Enter key and jump move the screen
reader focus straight to that heading
heading level two from today's featured
article you hear voiceover repeated the
heading again which means my focus is
right there from here on I can begin
exploring the page right underneath the
heading by pressing ctrl option right
arrow well to a four-link image Jonathan
Avenue into 0:06 column one with one
link
Jonathan Agnew born 4 April 1 9 6 0 is
an English link cricket cricket by the
way I can move by headings on the page
by pressing shortcut keys control option
command H to move forward by a heading
or control option command shift age to
move backward by a heading heading level
2 did you know heading level 2 in the
news
level two did you now padding level two
from today first heading petting level
two
from today's featured article this is a
quick way to navigate through a webpage
if I would like to move with built-in
shortcut keys directly through the
content as opposed to going through the
web browser options so this is how I
navigate the web page using headings
there are other few tricks I use however
I'll talk about them later it's
important to remember that once you've
made the functionality of your web page
accessible and usable for users of
assistive technology headings is
probably one of the most important
features you can build into your web
pages to make them more usable for
screen reader users specifically</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
