well the details will be different from
organization to organization the general
ideas will stay the same developers
don't just edit code files on one big
file server they use version control
systems to track their changes and keep
them in sync there are a bunch of
different version control systems out
there but some of the most important
ones these days are distributed VCS such
as get when a developer writes their
change they commit it to their fork or
branch of the project then when their
work is ready to be merged in they issue
a pull request to the main branch and
request a code review from their
colleague then once the review is done
they can merge their change in so there
are various points the testing can
happen developers can manually run tests
on their own code before code review or
as part of that process integration and
full system tests rely on running the
whole service often on a testing server
after that it's common practice to
deploy the changes to a staging server
for further tests the difference between
a test server and a staging server is
that the water resembles production as
closely as possible for instance having
real data and then if everything goes
well the build gets promoted to
production depending on the application
it can be a good idea to do rollouts
incrementally so that even if after all
this testing the release turns out to
break the service at least it doesn't
break all of it at once even if you
never want to have to use it having the
ability to rollback is really important
as you can see there are a fair number
of steps in this process if the handover
from every step to another was manual it
would be slow and potentially
error-prone slow manual processes create
bottlenecks and errors to create extra
unplanned work that uses up time to do
planned work so by automating as much as
we can and making sure that people can
fix the bottlenecks in their work
process DevOps practices can give us
much more time to do the actual
productive work</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
