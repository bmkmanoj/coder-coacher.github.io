clustering twice the first thing we do
is we're going to cluster in that big
feature space I was just showing you and
those clusters are gonna be referred to
as text ons now this is a word I think
it's a word that was coined by Bell
eulogy was a psycho physicist guy who
did random-dot stereograms quite a while
ago and they were referring to things
like t-junctions and little end stops
and other textural descriptors that
existed in in images as sort of he saw
them and the idea is that these clusters
in the feature space would be different
little textural elements that were found
in these images right and so you would
describe each little window okay by
what's referred to as its text on
histogram that's what this thing is
going to be showing here we'll take a
little bit more of that but the idea is
that here there is just a single value
at every pixel which is the single text
on that tends to be present that pixel
that is which cluster it got mapped to
and you can see that you know if you
were to just cluster based upon this it
would be kind of weird because yeah this
is not one nice thing because it's a
single texture but the idea here is that
even though this is a single texture
there are all these different little
text ons that are present so instead of
segmenting the image based upon which
single cluster you're map to instead
what we're gonna do is we're gonna take
little windows so here's a little
circular window and we compute its text
on histogram okay so now we've got a
whole bunch of different text ons and
this is the count of the number of those
texts on so I get a histogram at every
window so here's another window and it
has kind of a similar histogram and
here's a third window well it's
histogram looks nothing like that and
the idea is that you're now going to
cluster in the histogram space of these
text ons in order to be able to get your
segmentation all right and how well does
that work well let me show you an
example so
here is a picture of a rhinoceros no a
zebra I guess I don't know thing with
stripes okay so suppose I cluster it
based upon color what would that look
like well it would be a mess okay
and there's your mess color based
regions and you'd say well that's a
terrible idea
that's a terrible idea so what would be
a better idea well how about we cluster
based upon texture and you can see that
you get these broad clusters that seem
to do you know reasonable job I mean it
does make the entire you know this
region here which is sort of this big
region there you'll notice that it's not
you know because of the scales that got
used in this case it didn't find these
legs here or this one there but that's a
function of sort of how you go about
describing it and I will say that in
general this is kind of an under
segmented result there probably should
be more segments but clearly this is way
better than this color based approach
because it allows us to describe the
texture</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
