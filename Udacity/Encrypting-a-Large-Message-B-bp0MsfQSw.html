which takes as input a fixed length data
block say in 64-bit for DES or 128-bit
for AES what if we want to encrypt a
large message that is a message that's
longer than 64 bit or even 108 bit the
solution seems obvious why can we just
break a message into fixed size blocks
apply a block cipher such as DES or AES
on the blocks then the collection of the
ciphertext blocks is the ciphertext of
the large message is that it this seems
to be very simple let's take a look at a
few schemes that encrypt a large message
the simplest way is the so-called
electronic codebook method or ECB here
the original large message is broken
down into fixed sized blocks say 64 bit
and we pad the last block so that it is
also 64 bit and then each plaintext
block is encrypted using the same key
independently of each other and the
collection of these ciphertext blocks is
the cipher text of the original large
message the term codebook is used
because for given key there is a unique
server text block for every plaintext
block therefore we can construct a
gigantic codebook in which there's an
entry for every possible plaintext block
and a table entry shows the
corresponding ciphertext block of course
we construct one code book for each key
in practice only the plaintext blocks
they are used in application need to be
included in the code book that is the
codebook does not need to include all
possible plaintext blocks therefore it
does not have to be gigantic so this
seems to be a very convenient way of
encrypting a large message</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
