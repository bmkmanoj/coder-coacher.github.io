about this is thinking about how to
choose two votes so we have a hundred
votes to begin with therefore that the
audit therefore that the mixer cheats on
and the auditor is sampling 20 votes in
this space so as long as the auditor
picks one of the votes that was treated
on then the mixture would be detected so
we can compute this by dividing the
number of ways to choose without picking
any of the cheated votes so that's
choosing out of the 96 non cheating
votes divided by the total number of
ways of choosing the votes so to solve
this we just need to compute 96 choose
20 / 120 since the orders will cancel
out there 20 elements each time this is
the same as computing 96 x 95 times down
to 77 / 100 down to 81 we could cancel
things out and compute this by hand we
could also just compute it all in Python
so here's a procedure to compute the
product of a list remembering to
multiply by one point to turn this into
floating points so we get accurate
division and when we run that we get the
result point zero four with somewhere so
we might like a higher probability of
catching heaters if we think cheating on
four votes is enough to change the
election so we'd like to audit more
votes we can do that that will increase
the probability of catching a cheating
mixer but will also increase the
probability that privacy is lost that a
vote can be traced through the next net</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
