about three key ways to compute the
value of a company intrinsic value which
is based on future dividends in other
words companies pay a certain amount to
their investors every year based on how
many shares they own and this is the
value of all future dividends going into
the future book value which is the value
of the company if we split it up into
pieces and sold those individual pieces
and finally market capitalization which
is simply the value that the market is
placing on the company so many stock
trading strategies look for deviations
between say intrinsic value and market
cap if intrinsic value drops
significantly and the stock price say is
high it might be worthwhile to short
that stock or if say dividends are going
up and the market capitalization is low
and might be an opportunity to buy the
stock and similarly book value provides
a sort of lowest price when stock price
begins to approach book value you can
pretty much assume that the price is not
going to go below book value we're not
not much below it because if it does a
predatory buyer would buy the whole
company and break it up for parts anyhow
that's company valuation and I look
forward to seeing you at the next lesson
