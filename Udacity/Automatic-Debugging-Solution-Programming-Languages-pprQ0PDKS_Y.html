to write a function called auto de bug
which takes a test piece of code a test
list and a test interesting which checks
if a code is interesting in some way
what we really mean is if there's some
kind of bug that we know is going to
happen so we have this test specifically
to check for it in this case the test is
interesting if it contains a plus B on
the same line and variable a and
variable B before that line so how do we
go about doing this well we just we
first take the actual test list and the
interesting test itself and if test
itself is not interesting then we return
none because if it it's not as
interesting none of its subsets are
going to be interesting either otherwise
we continue on and we set a size a
current test best size and best test to
be the length of the current test and
test itself because we know those are
interesting since we didn't return and
we want to hopefully find a smaller
subset so that we can narrow down where
we are and where the bug we care about
actually is so we run through all the
subsets of tests and I'll go through how
we implemented that in second and for
every element smaller in all the
possible subsets of the test list we
check if first of all the length of this
subset is less than the current best
size the current size of the of an
interesting test list and that this
element is also interesting if it is
then we reset the new best test to be
this smaller subset and the current best
size to be equal to the length of this
smaller subset and we keep running
through this until we find hopefully the
smallest subset or a smallest subset we
might have two interesting subsets that
are the same size that's possible and
then once we are all done with checking
through all possible subsets we just
return the best test now to get all the
subsets which is something called a
power set if you're familiar with set
theory we run it through this other
function called all subsets that takes a
list
sets an element called power set our
pset that is a list containing just the
empty list is the empty list is always a
subset of everything is it's nothing and
for every element in the list we add 2
piece set for all X and that are
currently in p-set that plus the element
we're talking about and this is really
something that you should probably play
with and see see how it acts to really
buy that this does what it says it does
it's a really clever piece of code and
then we just return this and this is
just all the possible subsets including
the set itself so what the all subsets
method really does is it takes a list
let's say list 1 2 3 and it returns all
the subsets of that list so we would
have the empty list and we'd also have
the subsets containing just one element
and then all the subsets containing two
elements or sub lists I keep saying
subsets really these are lists and it's
not strictly the same thing but we can
treat them like that for now and then
all the subsets containing three
elements which is actually just the
overarching list itself and this is what
the function hall subsets returns now to
test this wait a few have a few test
cases down here and we already had the
interesting test that we talked about
earlier and we run test 1 through that
and test one is this fragment of code up
here so variable X variable Y variable z
x equals y plus Z y equals Z and Z
equals x plus X so we run that through
in through auto de bug and we should
find that this is the smallest
interesting fragment and we see the
first true statement means that this is
true find another interesting test for
this one it's just a list is interesting
if it contains three numbers in strict
ascending order and then we take some
numbers here that we have generated you
know somewhat randomly and we check
audit a bug against test two and
interesting too and just by hand
checking this you should see that the
length of the smallest interesting
subset is three which we can see when I
ran and we got true and indeed if we
check if the answer from this is itself
interesting if we run it back through
interesting we see that it is true so
our function for auto debugging or at
least some auto debugging works fairly
nicely</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
