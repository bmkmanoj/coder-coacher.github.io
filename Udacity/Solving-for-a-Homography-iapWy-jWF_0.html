that again remember we're looking for
eight parameters this is equal to one
which basically is the scale factor and
always known to be at one we need to set
up a system of linear equations like so
we're basically a H is equal to B and
how would we do this well H is our
unknowns so basically what we would need
to know is where as a vector of unknowns
H is basically all of the values
abcdefgh the eight things and that's my
vector what would be the other two terms
well basically we need eight equations
but more the better so these are eight
equations now but if you had more of
them well how do we get more of them we
actually can sample information from the
images ourselves so it can actually
compute all of this but what we want to
do is if we had more of them we can
actually now come up with better
solution so we need to solve for H here
I need to know a and I need to know B
and again those things are available
because I have the pair of images and if
course if it's an over constraint I can
actually get more samples what I can do
basically is make this into a least
square solution well basically I solve
it for a lot of information and of
course look for the minimum of the least
square solution</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
