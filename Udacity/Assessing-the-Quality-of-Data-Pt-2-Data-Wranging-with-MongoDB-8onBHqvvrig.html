least a few fixes for example this is a
picture of my house well actually it's
not my house
it's actually the house next door but in
its street map view Google Maps believes
this is actually my house here's another
quick example so this is the Wikipedia
page for the Volkswagen Beetle and
probably the most common name for the
beetle is bug but you can see here that
the nickname is BG it's just a typo but
a great example of the kinds of errors
that you can get any time humans are
involved in producing data which is
always let's take a look at one more
example before we move on this is some
financial data that I worked with
several years ago and a couple of
interesting things to note here
one is that this line here is missing
values for most of the fields there are
lots of reasons why that might be the
case this is the type of thing that
we've got to look for anytime we're
dealing with data another example here
has to do with what assumptions we might
have about the dates if you look at
these we might assume that this actually
means August 4th 2008 certainly if
you're an American that's the type of
assumption you'd make but then we get
two dates like this and there's actually
another example here where it becomes
pretty clear that this is probably a
date format in which the day comes first
so we've got to be careful about any
assumptions we bring with us into a data
wrangling task so let's go ahead and
spell this out we need to assess our
data in order to test assumptions about
the values that are there the data types
for those values and the shape of our
data we also need to identify errors or
outliers in our data we're going to look
at several ways of testing our data to
see whether there are errors present or
whether we have data that's really
outside the range of expected values and
finally we need to assess whether there
are any missing values within our data
in addition to all of this we also need
to make sure that our data will support
the types of queries that we need to
make the idea here is to eliminate
surprises leading to bad analysis later
we'll go into all of this in lesson 3
but before we can clean any data we need
to make sure we know how to gather data
and that's what we're going to be
looking at in the rest of this lesson
and the lesson that follows</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
