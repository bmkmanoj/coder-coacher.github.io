called canonical objects this is where
you create an object centered around the
origin and then apply a series of
transforms to move it into position this
is fine so far as it goes
but it's sometimes awkward when you want
to perform particular kinds of modeling
for example if I want to make a model
where I want chains of cones to build a
tree I might rather say where I want
each end of the cone to be located this
sort of modeling where I run a program
to generate an object is called
procedural modeling I want to orient the
cone given the top and bottom locations
that'll be your task in the calling
routine the top and bottom variables are
vector three positions giving the ends
of the cone you'll see documentation for
the other variables in the code itself
your task is to implement the internals
of this method actually I decided to
simplify a major piece for you mainly
because it has a special case having to
do with the cross product I implemented
this function myself so your job is to
create the proper length cylinder and
feed this method its axis direction and
center when you get the answer right
you'll see this on your screen I give a
lot of test cones here and in fact a few
of these revealed some bugs in my own
code when I was writing it if you ever
design a component like this that will
be used by others I highly recommend
that you try to create as many different
types of test cases as you can</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
