complexity of the mutual exclusion lock
algorithm the lock primitive when a
process makes a lock request it sends n
minus one request messages because there
are n nodes in the distributed system
there are n minus 1 peers and so every
node has to send a request message to
all its peers so n minus 1 messages are
the request message is sent out and in
response to these request messages every
peer is going to acknowledge a request
message so they're going to be n minus 1
messages traversing the network which
has the acknowledgement message for this
lock request and then the process is
happy using the lock for the critical
section and it gets to the unlock
primitive and the unlock primitive once
again we're going to send n minus 1
unlock messages so the unlock primitive
involves sending an unlocked message to
every one of the peers in the
distributed system so n minus 1 message
is a centered on the network the
interesting thing that you notice is
that there is no acknowledgement for the
unlock message because of the assumption
that we make that messages are never
lost and therefore when I send an unlock
message I know that everybody will get
it everybody will remove my request from
the respective queues and go on with
life and therefore there is no
acknowledgement for that and so if you
count the number of messages that are
involved in a lock + unlock totally we
have 3 to the N minus 1 that's some
total number of messages that are
incurred that is a message in complexity
of the distributed mutual exclusion lock
algorithm that begs the question can we
do better and the answer is yes and the
reason is going back to the condition
that I said that is used in making a
decision as to whether I won the lock or
not if you recall I told you that the
condition is my request has to be at the
top of the queue and second I should
have either gotten acknowledgments for
that request from everybody else or I
received a lock request from my peers
that have a timestamp
that is later than my own lock request
if the lock request that I've received
from my peers have time stamps that are
later than mine I know that they are
going to wait for me to be served before
they're going to use the lock and
therefore what I can do if I am i
receiving node for a lock request when I
see a lock request normally I would go
ahead and do an acknowledgement but when
I get a lock request and I see hey this
guy is lock request is going to be after
mine so i don't have to send an
acknowledgement yet what i can do is
wait till i am actually going to unlock
my unlock itself can serve as the
acknowledgement for that particular node
that has made a lock request that is
later in time than my own so in other
words we can defer the acknowledgments
if my lock request precedes my peers
lock requests so we are combining the
acknowledgement for a lock request with
the unlock so if I do that then I can
bring the message complexity down to 2
to the N minus 1 so what we're doing is
to get rid of the acknowledgement
messages if in fact our old lock request
is ahead of an incoming request that I
see from up here that's how we can
reduce a messaging complexity of this
algorithm to be 2 to the N minus 1 by
the way the distributed mutual exclusion
lock problem has been a fertile ground
for researchers to think about new
algorithms that can shave the messaging
complexity even further from the stew
the N minus 1 and I invite you to look
at the literature to see other works
that have been done to reduce a message
complexity to even smaller numbers than
2 times n minus 1</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
