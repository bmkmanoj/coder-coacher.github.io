one way association one approach is to
just duplicate the approach we had with
one-way associations that is have your
attribute in class a pointing to an
instance in Class B and have in class be
an attribute which points to an instance
in class a or you could do these with
with vectors if there's a many-to-many
relationship you can use this approach
if if you don't run into referential
integrity constraints if you have
referential integrity constraints you
have to make sure for example when
you're deleting an element from a vector
in instance of class a that you also go
over and find the instance in Class B
and look in its vector to find the back
pointer or to the instance in class I
and make sure that's deleted with an
extra burden and complexity on your
program an alternative to having the
symmetric solution is to just have
pointers in one direction if you want to
traverse in the other direction you have
to do a search so let's say we'd like to
go from an instance of class b to an
instance in class a first you have to
find that instance in class b and from
it go back and find the instance in
class a it's extra work and a third
approach i want to mention is to use
associations themselves as objects</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
