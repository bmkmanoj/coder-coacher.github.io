so far about strings we started out by
talking about what a string is composed
of and we saw how to define a string
using a string literal use letter VAR
the way you would with any other
constant or variable and then type your
string literal in between quotations we
also learned that swift strings are
encoded with unicode scalars for this
reason we're able to incorporate any
Unicode character into a swift string
including emojis let's make two strings
similar to those above but this time use
the monkey emoji in the mobile phone
emoji remember to access the emoji
keyboard in playgrounds you can press
ctrl command spacebar we also learned
that strings and Swift are encoded in a
struct and the characters of a string
can be accessed through the characters
property belonging to the string struct
for example let's say we wanted to count
how many g's are in this string we could
loop through all the characters in the
string using the characters property
like so an increment account each time
we encounter a G and then if we type
count into playground and look over in
the sidebar we can see that our count is
five string interpolation is another
incredibly convenient feature of Swiss
strings here's an example let's say we
have to convert from an integer
representing number of pennies to a
string representing dollars and cents we
can use string interpolation along with
operators to get our solution we can
calculate the number of dollars by
dividing by a hundred and we can
calculate the number of cents by taking
the modulo of 100 then through string
interpolation we can take this variable
dollar int along with this expression
and insert them into a string and you
can see that string here in the sidebar
we looked at some common string
manipulations starting with string
concatenation for example we can combine
our monkey string and our thief string
to make a very short story about a
monkey with sticky fingers we also
learned that the Swift string struct is
bridge to the NS string class in
Objective C this opens up a host of
useful methods including contain string
string by replacing occurrences of
string and lots more
let's look at those methods one more
time here we're calling the method
contains string on the variable monkey
string and we're passing in key as a
parameter by doing this we're asking if
the monkey string contains the string
key and over here in the sidebar we can
see that the method returns true here's
another one let's say our Wi-Fi password
is meet me in st. Louis but we need to
switch it up a bit let's replace all the
ease with threes using the NS string
method string by replacing occurrences
of string and what you're looking at
here is the variable name followed by
the dot operator string by replacing
occurrences of string and then the
parameters were passing in our the
string we want to replace and the
replacement string and over here in the
sidebar we can see the result</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
