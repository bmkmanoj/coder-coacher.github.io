where you don't know the exact size it
will be or when handling different size
devices it can be useful to display the
image at a fixed aspect ratio so you
know how your design will appear for
your users we've already covered using
scale type such as center crop to make
the content fit within an image view but
how do we enforce the size of the view
itself to do this we can easily subclass
image view to enforce a given aspect
ratio let's walk through an example of
always wanting our images to show with a
free two aspect ratio that is whatever
width it's given we'll set its own
height to be two thirds of this let's
create a new class and we're calling it
free to image view here and we'll extend
from image view itself now we'll
generate all of the required
constructors to handle correctness view
from code or from XML now the key part
let's override the on measure method
we'll unpack the width we're given and
then calculate two thirds of this as the
free two height well then say that our
views height wants to be exactly that
two thirds of the width height we then
pass these on to the superclass to
handle the rest of the measurement pass
to use our custom class we use our fully
qualified name in the tag and follow the
convention of setting 0 DP as the height
as this declared value isn't used but
has to be provided and the view itself
will then calculate harked later on when
it measures itself this is similar to
how we used weights in Lesson one to
fill the space in a linear layout we set
0 DP as the unused size because the
weight would fill it in later we'll go
into much more detail on altering your
layout for different size devices in
lesson 5</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
