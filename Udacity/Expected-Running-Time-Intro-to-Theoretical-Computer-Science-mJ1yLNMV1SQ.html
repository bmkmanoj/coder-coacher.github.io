here reveals that if the boolean formula
has a satisfying assignment then this
assignment is found with the probability
of about 3/4 to the power of n times
some polynomial of N and I'll just write
that s P of n here so how many times do
you have to run this algorithm given
this success probability here to find a
satisfying assignment on average
assuming there exists one now if you
have had a basic statistics course you
should already know that the expected
running time so how often we have to run
this algorithm until we find a
satisfying assignment assuming the
boolean formula has one is the time for
a single run divided by the success
probability of one run and of course I'm
going to let you figure out the final
answer for this as our next quiz so it's
the expected running time o of 3/4 to
the power of n times a polynomial of n
which is this polynomial here times some
other polynomial which will represent
the time for one run of this algorithm
here or is it oh of 4/3 to the power of
n times the polynomial of n times the
time required for this algorithm here or
is it
oh of 3/4 to the power of n times the
polynomial for this algorithm here
divided by this polynomial here or
finally is it o of 4/3 to the power of n
times the time required to run this
algorithm here divided by this
polynomial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
