is to come up with a dictionary of all
the words now we've created a small file
with about four thousand words in it
called words for k text so let's take
that file read it convert it to
uppercase because scrabble and words
with friends use only uppercase letters
split it into a list of words assign
that to a global variable will call it
words and put it all uppercase just make
sure that it stands out and let's make
this a set so that access to it is easy
we can figure out very quickly whether a
word is in the dictionary okay so now
we're done we have our words then I want
to find all the words within a hand and
so the hand will be seven letters and I
want to find all the words of seven
letters or less that can be made out of
those letters and I'm going to start
with a very straightforward approach and
then we're going to refine it over time
so here's what I've done I haven't
worried about repeating myself and about
making the code long I just wanted to
make it straight forward and then I said
first letter A can be any letter in the
hand if that's a word then go ahead and
add that to my set of results so I start
off with an empty set of results and i'm
going to add as i go otherwise be can be
any letter in the result of removing a
from the hand and now the word that I'm
building up is a plus B two letter word
and if that's a word add it otherwise c
can be any letter in the hand without w
in it so the remaining letters in the
hand a new word is a plus B plus C and
if that's in words and then add it and
we just keep on going through adding a
letter each time checking to see if
that's in the words adding them up
here's my definition of removed it takes
a hand or a sequence of letters and then
the letter or letters to remove for each
of those letters just replace the letter
in the collection of letters with the
empty string and do that exactly once so
don't remove all of them and then return
the remaining letters and does it work
well if I find words with this sequence
of letters in my hand comes back with
this list and so that looks pretty good
it's hard for me to verify right now
that I found everything that's in my
dictionary
but it looks good and I did a little bit
of poking around in the dictionary for
likely things and all the words I could
think of that weren't in this set we're
not in the dictionary and that's why
they weren't included so that looks
pretty good I'm going to be doing a lot
of work here and I'm going to be
modifying this function and changing it
so I'd like to have a better set of
tests than just one test</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
