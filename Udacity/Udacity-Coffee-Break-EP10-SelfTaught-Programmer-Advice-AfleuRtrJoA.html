coffee break my name is grant Gilbertson
and I am an editor here at Udacity first
off we'd like to take a moment to
applaud all of our students who are
taking our courses as part of their
non-traditional paths to careers in tech
so to that we say thank you and now
you'd ask the software engineer Chris
Chu was kind enough to take a few
moments to kind of explain his
non-traditional path to a career in tech
so take the next few minutes to see what
he has to say hi everyone I'm Chris Chu
I'm a software engineer here at Udacity
and I want to talk a little bit about
what it means to have a non-traditional
computer science education many of our
students are not taking the typical four
six year kind of formal education route
I wanted to share my experience because
I do not have formal computer science
education I actually studied ancient
languages and philosophy in school and
kind of became a programmer by accident
at an opportunity to create an Access
database for a guy and which turned into
a PHP in my sequel web app when he
wanted to travel around the world and
still run his business and then cut out
of nowhere I became a programmer and I
pursued that I guess because I enjoyed
it and is also the most efficient use of
my time I felt and so I just pursued
pursuit on my own figuring out you know
you know how to do this kind of problem
by problem it's been a lot of time you
know buying books and reading things on
the internet and finding other
programmers that I knew and my other
kind of networks and try and learn you
know how do they do what do it what
tools do they use what tips do they have
and I'm project-by-project I feel like I
kind of got to to be where I want to be
and a big part of that I think was
having courage I really try and
encourage people to have the courage and
the faith of themselves that to just
start a project and you'll figure it out
and so it's always fun to start a
project not knowing the technology
platform or something you know that but
just have the courage that you you'll
you know figure it out with a couple
stressful nights maybe but in the end
you'll have come you know so much
further and the next project will be
even better now Chris was starting to be
a programmer he didn't have access to
you to a city courses but the good news
is you do and you can start today
advantage of it by browsing our course
catalog and seeing where you'd like to
start your program in career</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
