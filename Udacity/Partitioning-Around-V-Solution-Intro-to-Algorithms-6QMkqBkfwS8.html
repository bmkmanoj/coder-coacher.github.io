rank algorithm that we had before to do
what I suggested it's going to return a
kind of slightly sorted or list than the
one that it was given with regard to
some value V so there's a lot of ways to
do this some are cleaner and more
efficient than others I'm going to do it
the way I'm doing it just to be simple
all right so this is a very simple idea
all we're going to do is we're going to
keep track of a list of values that are
known to be smaller than V that are NL
and the ones that are bigger than V
we're going to loop through all the
values any time we encounter one that's
smaller than V we put it in the smaller
list every time we find one that's
bigger than V we put it in the bigger
list and then we glue them all together
first the smaller then V and the bigger
now this sort of plus equals a list
construct it's not immediately obvious
what the running time of this is in
Python in fact I think it's probably not
constant time but you can create a
version where each of these steps is
constant time so that this entire
routine runs in big theta of n because
all we're doing is we're touching each
of the values in the list to construct a
new list so let's run this and see what
it does all right it seems to be done
here's 84 and you'll notice that these
are the all the elements of the original
list 84 is here everything to the right
of it is bigger than 80 for everything
to the left of it is smaller than 84 so
we partitioned the list around 84</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
