there's degrees of hardness of different
kinds of problems kind of like rocks if
you've ever studied rocks there's
there's a scale for how hard a rock is
well there's kind of a scale for how
hard problems are as well and some of
the entries on the scale include things
like well some problems are actually not
computable we can define a problem and
we can show that there is no computer
program that can actually solve that
problem that's hard in some sense that's
that's maybe as hard as you can imagine
Oh an example of a problem in this class
is the halting problem and you can see I
have a music video about the halting
problem if you want to take a look at it
but we're not going to talk about it
more in this class there are some other
problems like I mentioned before that
are computable we can actually solve
them with a computer program but they
require at least exponential time as I
mentioned generalized checkers is an
example of that there's problems that
are computable and can be solved in
polynomial time like the shortest path
problem with Dijkstra's algorithm and
some that are computable can be solved
really quickly in linear time in the
same amount of time it would take to
just look at the the example you can
actually get an answer so graph
connectivity and is an example of a
problem in that class so what we're
gonna do the way we think about this is
the hardness of a problem like the how
connected our two nodes in a graph or
our two nodes in a graph connected the
hardness of the problem is the running
time of the very best possible algorithm
for that problem for some problems we're
not exactly sure how hard they are but
we have lower bounds and upper bounds so
for example we might know that a certain
problem requires at least n squared time
to solve but we know that it requires no
more than n to the fifth so the the true
complexity the true hardness of this
problem is somewhere between those two
bounds so here's a question for you
what's a good way to find an upper bound
on a problems hardness if we know an
upper bound and a lower bound that gives
us a sense of how hard the problem is
how do we find an upper bound so here's
some choices one is devise an algorithm
to solve the problem
run it on a bunch of inputs and then
look on the graph to see what the shape
of it is and that tells us the bound so
that's one choice note choices again
devise an algorithm to solve it run that
algorithm on all possible inputs and
take a look at the running time that
results from this that gives you the
upper bound third you can imagine
devising an algorithm to solve the
problem and then analyzing it and
whatever the Big O or big theta is that
you get from that analysis is an upper
bound on the hardness of the problem and
then the final choice is this is a trick
question the whole question of upper
bounds must be some other class because
it's not what we've been studying in
this class so decide which one you think
is most appropriate and check it off</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
