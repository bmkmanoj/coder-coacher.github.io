about the relationship between the block
size and the Miss rate the question was
which of the three C's are really
reduced when the Miss rate goes down
obviously some misses have been
eliminated
the question is which type suffered the
elimination let's first look at the
compulsory misses if we have a small
block size and this is our memory we'll
bring in this block and suffer a Miss
for the first time we bring in another
block and suffer a Miss now let's say we
bring in this block and suffer a Miss if
the cache line size was twice of what it
is now then the second one would not
have been a miss because when we fetch
the first one the second one would have
also been in the same cache block so as
you can see the increase in the block
size assuming there is enough locality
will result in a reduction in compulsory
misses another way to look at this is to
note that we get a compulsory miss when
we access the block for the very first
time well if you have larger blocks
there are fewer blocks so there are
fewer blocks to access for the very
first time and that will guarantee a
reduction in compulsory misses assuming
there is any spatial locality now let's
look at capacity misses let's say that
the program is accessing a relatively
large array that doesn't fit in the
cache and then we go back and access it
again on the second set of accesses we
are having capacity misses the first set
of accesses were compulsory misses
because these blocks were never in the
cache because they don't fit in the
cache by the time we get to the end of
the array the beginning of the array is
kicked out of the cache and now we are
suffering capacity misses these blocks
would be in the infinite cache they are
not in the cache because it was not
large enough but how many misses we will
have for this array depends on the block
size with smaller blocks the same sized
array will be occupying more blocks with
larger blocks we will have fewer blocks
the number of Miss
we'll be equal to the number of blogs so
as you can see if we increase the block
size and our miss rate goes down because
there is plenty of spatial locality we
are also reducing the number of capacity
misses and finally if we look at the
conflict misses we can construct a
similar example where two blocks are
kicking each other out and because each
time we fetch a larger block if the
block size goes up we will be having
fewer conflict misses so the increase in
block size can improve all types of
misses that is it can reduce the number
for all three types of misses when we
increase the block size the compulsory
misses are almost always gonna go down
the capacity misses are gonna go down as
long as there is enough locality and the
conflict misses are likely to stay
similar but might go down</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
