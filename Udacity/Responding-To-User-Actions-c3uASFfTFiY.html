pick when they want to eat the menu item
I've added a drop-down with options for
breakfast lunch and dinner now we just
need the button there we go we're now
set with all HTML content but choosing
an item still doesn't make it appear up
in the order tracker let's wire the
different parts of our app together
ember controls user interaction through
actions the default action is a click so
adding this action to our button will
listen for a click it will call the
choose item function and pass along the
items name this function is defined in
the menu items component file inside an
actions object let's set up the action
in action handlers clicking the button
now calls this function with the items
name we need to create this function in
the component file all actions need to
be inside an actions object note that
this is actions with an S while this is
action without an S the function is
called choose item and it receives the
menu name when the button is clicked the
order manager service needs to be
updated with the new selection we don't
have access to the order manager in this
component yet so we just need to inject
it now we have access to the order
manager service under this name to
update the service when the button is
clicked we first get the service until
which meal to add the item to remember
that this method already exists on the
order manager service object I've
hard-coded the default meal time to
breakfast but users really should be
able to choose the meal I've switched
things around to use this property which
still defaults to breakfast but with
this setup we can use the template to
update this property this adds an action
to the select element that fires on
change instead of when being clicked it
calls the change category function and
passes along the value that was selected
the change category function just
updates this field now we can choose a
menu item and have it show up in the
order tracker how awesome is that now we
just need a way to let the user canceled
an item and change the active day we'll
add both of these to the order tracker
component so if a menu item has been
picked for a meal we want to let our
users cancel it this will check if a
menu item has been picked this is just
an exome both at when clicked we'll
remove this day's breakfast item let's
create this action handler in the
component file
this remove function tells the order
manager service to remove the menu
option for the meal time of the past and
day to let users choose the day they're
adding meals for we'll add an action to
this div remember that we're looping
over each day of the week so this day
will change with each loop clicking this
div will call this action passing along
this day the set day to function just
tells the service to update the selected
day and we're finished our app displays
content handles user interaction and
manages data and it does all of this
instantaneously in with no page
refreshes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
