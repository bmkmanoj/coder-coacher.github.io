that I want to discuss are agile
software development processes and this
is a group of software development
methods that are based on highly
territorial development and in
particular I'm going to discuss
test-driven development or TDD it's
based on the iteration of three main
phases in the first one that we mark as
read we write test cases that encode our
requirements and for which we haven't
written code yet and therefore they will
fail obviously so we're in this sort of
read or fail phase from this phase we
move to this phase in which after we
write just enough code to make the test
cases pass we have a set of test cases
that are all passing and therefore we
can consider this as the green phase we
have enough code to make the test cases
pass because the test cases encode our
requirements we have just written enough
code to satisfy our requirements when we
do this over time though what happens
that the structure of the code
deteriorates because we keep adding
pieces so that's what we have the first
step which is refactoring in this step
we modify the code and we will talk
about refactoring extensively we'll
devote one lesson to it we modify the
code to make it more readable more
maintainable in general we modify to
improve the design of the code and after
this phase we will go back to writing
more test cases for new requirements
write code that makes these test cases
pass and so on so we'll continue to
iterate among these phases and also in
this case we will talk about agile
software processes and in particular
about extreme programming or XP and
scrum in more details in minute course
