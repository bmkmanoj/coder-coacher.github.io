Bay Area California Bay Area and i have
read Marion color blindness okay so
red-green color blindness we you know
just sort of heard about that for the
first time and the course and we're
learning a bit more about the
inheritance patterns what is red wing
colorblindness what does it mean to be
red green colorblind well to me what it
means is that I often mix up colors that
have read in them and so in particular I
mix up reds and browns and sometimes
browns and greens because I'm not seeing
the red correctly in those sometimes it
can even show up in the form of blues
and purples I'm sort of seeing them all
is about the same and in fact you know
they may look different to other people
so would it be accurate and saying it's
just the kind of like darker colors or
is it something about the shade maybe
I'm not really sure I think that the way
to think about it you know for me is
that sometimes what you may be seeing as
the red in a particular orange for
instance to me I'm not seeing the red
the same way you are so I'm sitting it
may be like a dark yellow and so I
certainly see the world in a vibrant
colorful way and it's not so like black
and white or anything like that I just
see it differently than everybody else
who doesn't see it in red green park
it's such a great like literal and
metaphorical statement I think a lot of
people do go through life thinking you
know the Assumption this is the color
vision this is the vision I have but not
everybody literally sees the world in
the same spectrum that's right when did
you first know that you had red-green
color blindness you know I don't really
remember it was when I was a really
young child my uncle had been red-green
colorblind and then actually my mom's
uncle as well so I think it I inherited
it from her side and so when I was a
little kid she recognized that I might
be colorblind or add this propensity and
so she had me tested of you know one of
the eye doctors with looking at the
little bubble charts with colors that
you may remember having taken at some
point sure and for anybody who may not
be familiar with those what can can you
describe that bubble chart a little more
sure it's a basically a lot of little
dots and those dots typically show some
sort of a picture character or letter
that a red-green color bun person may
not be able to pick out the particular
picture or letter that everybody else
you know it pops out so for instance
back to my yellow orange analogy
you know you may have two different
shades of orange in there that to you
look really obviously different and to
me look actually about the same so I'm
not seeing that letter that's popping
out of the picture and you are so as
you've grown up and even now as an adult
how does red-green color blindness
affect your daily life do you have what
kind of special if anything sort of
interactions you have to go through to
accommodate you know not much when I
clothes shop you know online certainly
helps these days because the colors are
all labeled you know when I go clothes
shopping in the store I'll often ask the
retail person just to sanity check what
color is this if it's blue I'm generally
pretty sure I'm okay or black or things
like that but if I'm getting something
that's in the green spectrum you know
I'll want a sanity check that it's what
I think it is and it's not some version
of orange or something that people are
going to comment on so that's one way
you know another way is just
periodically things that look
camouflaged to me won't be camouflaged
to other people so for instance you know
my kids the other day we're playing with
an orange ball in the yard and to me
when they dropped in the grass it was
almost camouflaged in the grass and you
know they thought that was the funniest
thing in the world because to them this
orange is just totally popping off the
long have you ever not been able to
participate in something or anything
because of the color blindness or
anything like that or if you pretty much
always been able to find some work
around if it was an issue you could you
know it was always doable yeah I mean as
a general statement it's really never
been a big deal I certainly remember a
couple times as a kid where I felt a
little left out or picked on during art
projects at school where you know
inevitably I'd pick the wrong color you
were supposed to do something that was
brown and I picked green or something of
that nature and then other kids would
tease me and yeah I really remember
maybe two or three of these incidents
but he certainly work around it and
somebody points you to the right color
and you keep moving so never been a big
deal by any means but you know there's
certainly a little bit of that like it
you are a little bit different from the
way everybody else is seeing it but if
someone's watching this and you know
they're like oh you know I wonder if I'm
color blind or maybe someones recently
found out they are someone they know is
what advice would you give to somebody
who may have recently found out that you
know they are red-green colorblind and
of course
other kinds of colorblindness to what
advice would you give to them how I
guess first point would simply be it's
not that big a deal so you know roll
with it and enjoy the fact that you're
seeing the world and the slightly
different color hues and everybody else
is and then the other one would be yeah
when you're picking clothes ask a friend
or the sales associate at the store just
so that you know what your behind sure</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
