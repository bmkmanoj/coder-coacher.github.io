slope and the y-intercept but i just
gave you two points well we remember
from before we could calculate the slope
from these two we want the rise / the
run so the difference of the Y values
divided by the difference of the X
values we can calculate the slope to the
negative 3 halves and again we don't
have the y intercept so we need a
different approach to actually write our
equation we're going to use something
called point-slope form we can have one
point the XY since both variables appear
in linear equations at least equations
that are not horizontal or vertical
lines if we multiply both sides by the
denominator X minus x1 we can reduce
this to make one this is our point-slope
form we call it point-slope form since
we have well a point and the slope we
know these two points define a line so
let's use the same process to find the
equation of our line I know the slope is
negative three halves and then I make
one of the points be XY and now i'm
going to plug in one of these points so
what do you think which point is best to
use for x1 y1 should we use this point
or should we use this point which one do
you think would be easier to substitute
