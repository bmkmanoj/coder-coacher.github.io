to use the advanced option so you have
more control over the nodes in the
cluster you can choose which
applications you want to installed on
the cluster let's just stick with Hadoop
and hive for now you won't be doing any
additional configuration so skip this
part
but do read up on configuration in the
future as the default settings such as
the block size might not fit your needs
but do read up on the configuration in
the future as the default settings such
as the block size might not fit your
needs here you can add the steps that
the cholesterol run when it's created
you can have the cluster terminated
itself after all the steps are completed
there's a convenient way to run a bunch
of analysis jobs without having a
permanent cluster for now we'll leave
this unchecked since we want to keep the
cluster around for a bit
next you can add nodes to the cluster
the master node doesn't need much
computation power so this can be a
smaller less expensive instance Amazon
suggests you should use in one large
instance the core nodes are used to
store and process data you need to
create enough core nodes to store your
input data taking into account the
replication factor by default
replication factor is 3/4 a cluster of
10 or more nodes 2 for a cluster 4 to 9
nodes and 1 for a cluster with 3 or
fewer nodes for now just choose two m3x
large instances just the default setting
task nodes are used solely for
processing data you won't use any now so
leave this at 0 and continue with the
setup if you point the logging directory
to a folder on your s3 bucket then
continue on finally continue without a
private key or choose one you've used
previously and still around on your
computer you can use this key to SSH
into the cluster instances later now
create the cluster after a few minutes
it'll be ready you can add more core and
task nodes here by clicking resize you
run jobs on the cluster by adding steps
through here this is what you'll be
doing next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
