collected and modeled our requirements
so the next thing that we can do is to
analyze the requirements to identify
possible problems and specifically there
are three types of analysis that we can
perform the first type of analysis is
verification so in this case we are
talking about the requirements
verification and verification developers
will study the requirements to check
whether they're correct whether they
accurately reflect the customer needs as
perceived by the developer developers
can also check the completeness of the
requirements check whether there are any
missing pieces in the requirements as we
discussed earlier they can check whether
the requirements are pertinent or
contain irrelevant information like the
one shown here and they can also check
whether they are consistent and
ambiguous testable and so on so all
those properties that should be
satisfied for the requirements a second
type of analysis that is typically
performed on requirements is validation
and the goal of validation is to assess
whether the collected requirements
define the system that the stakeholders
really want so the focus here is on the
stakeholders and in some cases
stakeholders can check the requirements
directly if the requirements are
expressed in a notation that they
understand or they might check them by
discussing them with the developers
another possibility is that stakeholders
assess the requirements by interacting
with the prototype of the system in case
the requirements engineering process
that is being used involves early
prototyping and finally service testing
and other techniques can also be used to
validate requirements a final type of
analysis that we can perform on
requirements is risk analysis and risk
analysis aims to identify and analyze
the main risks involved with the
development of the system being
considered and if some requirements are
deemed to be too risky like in this case
this may result in changes in the
requirements model to eliminate or
address those risks and note that all
these analysis activities can be
performed in many different ways
depending on the modeling languages
chosen to represent the requirements and
on the context</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
