encryption function to be invertible
because to do decryption we need to use
the inverse of the encryption function
cfb does not as we saw both encryption
and decryption use the encryption
function in the forward direction this
has an advantage that means they're more
possible functions we could use for this
we haven't seen any yet but soon we'll
talk about hash functions which could be
used as the encryption function first
cipher feedback mode
neither of them require the IV to be
kept secret and one way to see this is
if you look at the structure of the
ciphers they're using the IV as though
it was ciphertext block negative one and
all the other ciphertext blocks are
visible to the attacker so if you think
about how it's used it's used just like
another ciphertext block there's no
security required in keeping the IV
secret what's important about the IV for
both of these is that it's not reused
that a unique IV is used to avoid the
possibility of the same block is
encrypted the same way the big advantage
of cipher feedback mode over cipher
block chaining mode is this ability to
use small message box we can select the
value of s and only encrypt the message
in chunks of size s this means we can
use this mode to turn a block cipher
into a stream cipher where we're
encrypting messages one byte at a time
if we want it to do that it's not
necessarily the best way to design a
stream cipher because we're doing a lot
more work than might be necessary this
one is maybe a little unfair to ask
since we didn't talk about this but it's
important point to make is that neither
of these as we've described them provide
any strong protection against tampering
an attacker can modify the blocks can
move blocks around the decryption may or
may not look like a valid decryption
depending on what the contents are but
there's no way that easily detect that
there's been tampering with either of
these modes and we'll talk about in a
future class ways to provide message
authentication that would make it so you
can detect when tampering happens the
final property is that the final
ciphertext blocks depend on all of the
message blocks and this is actually true
for both and this turns out to be a
property that's very useful for what I'm
going to talk about next which is
cryptographic hash functions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
