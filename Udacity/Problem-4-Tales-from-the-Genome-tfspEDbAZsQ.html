pedigree as the previous problem same
parents same situation and they're going
to have a second child and they want to
know if their new trout is going to be
affected by the same genetic disease
well we know that it's autosomal
recessive so we don't worry about sex
chromosomes or anything here we need to
figure out first some probability so we
know that if the affected offspring is
affected their minus minus so the
parents must be heterozygous here so
then if we set up a simple punnett
square we can see that all of the
possible options are plus plus plus
minus plus minus and minus minus there
are four options total and only one out
of these four options results in another
affected individual so for this question
one out of four or twenty-five percent
would be the probability of them having
another child with galactosemia now this
isn't the probability that they would
have another child in addition to the
first one this is just as an independent
single event what's the probability that
they'll have an affected child based on
what we know now because both are
heterozygous we know that there's a one
in four chance that they can produce
another offspring that has this rare
autosomal recessive disease galactosemia</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
