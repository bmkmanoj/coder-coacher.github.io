preparatory activity where you thought a
bit about what the difference between
hard things and easy things is then you
read a bit about cognitive load theory
and identify these three different types
of cognitive load intrinsic cognitive
load the cognitive load that just is
part of doing a task Germain cognitive
load which is that part that's
associated with building a new schema
and then extraneous which is that bit of
cognitive load that doesn't actually
need to be there and which as educators
we should try to minimize you watch a
bit of a Udacity lesson through the lens
of this cognitive load theory and then
read a bit about information processing
theory which deals with these three
different forms of memory sensory
working and long-term then you apply
this information processing theory by
reviewing the same lesson you reviewed
in step 3 but this time focusing on
where a learner may be putting their
attention and you probably found that
this lesson just had too much going on
for a true in office next you took the
learning objectives that you created in
the previous lesson and deconstructed
your own expertise and finally you
create an outline for your lesson the
last thing I want to say is this
designing good learning experiences is
hard but when we spend time actively
deconstructing our own expertise by
focusing on where we place our attention
we can lay out lessons which will
challenge students while still
respecting the limitations of their
working memory now go and build
incredible learning experiences for your
students</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
