designing a good lesson starts with
creating the right learning objective
when I first got to Udacity I would
think of a course as a series of tasks
and you know these are the things I want
a student to do and just just as a list
like a table of contents of things I
need you to do that approach didn't work
very well because the student doesn't
really understand why I'm having them do
these things what what is the reason
they're just having to do it because I
say do it so once Willa discovered that
helped me make much better courses where
learning objectives these learning
objectives are statements that really
define the perspective shift a student's
going to go through a perspective shift
being that aha moment where the students
like oh I get it now and using these
statements you can really understand
where the student is beginning and where
they're ending up through the whole
process rather than just doing a series
of tasks the student really understands
oh this is why I'm doing that task I
understand why one instance that comes
to mind we're learning objectives really
defined how we're going to build this
course was our accessibility course
there are a lot of tasks involved in
accessibility and I could just tell you
to do these tasks what I really want you
to get from this course is to develop
empathy with disabled users rather than
just tell you do this has do this task
we want you to experience using an
application as a disabled user so you
get that perspective shift that oh
that's why this is important so in using
learning objectives to develop this
course we actually have the student use
an application with tools that disabled
people use such as a screen reader and
this really helps the student develop
empathy with those users and say oh
that's why this is so difficult and why
these tasks are so important for me to
do sure a student would be able to
accomplish those tasks without
understanding and developing this
empathy with the disabled community but
the intent of the class is for a student
to really understand accessibility and
to get this higher level picture because
in the future those tasks might change
and new technologies might come
and sure we might have to teach those in
the future but for right now if you can
just get this this understanding of what
a disabled user really goes through that
gives you the ability to teach those
future technologies to yourself down the
road</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
