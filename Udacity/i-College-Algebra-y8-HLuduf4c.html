negative number belong outside of the
portion of the diagram that contains the
real numbers so in this area over here
since we don't have a name for the type
of number right now you need to come up
with one and since these numbers are
real numbers you might as well call
these numbers imaginary numbers since
they're not real I think this is a
pretty cool term it's hard to even think
about what a number that's imaginary
means or what it really is we'll get a
handle on this soon enough for now
though let's talk about the simplest
imaginary number we have well in my mind
the simplest negative number I can think
of is negative 1 the number related to
this that we're interested in then is
the square root of negative 1 now
because this is the simplest of that new
type of numbers that we're talking about
the imaginary numbers it gets a special
name it gets its own letter I because
it's the simplest imaginary number note
that even though this is a letter
representing a number this is not a
variable it's a constant just like we
have numbers like pie and e that also
have letters going along with them I is
just representing the constant the
square root of negative one so let's
play around with I a little bit since we
know that I is just a number albeit a
new kind of number but still just a
number we should be able to take it to
different powers for each of these I'd
like you to write in what number you
think it's equal to so what is I to the
zero what is I to the one what is I to
the two etc now of course since I is an
imaginary number we would assume that
some of these answers at least will be
imaginary numbers as well so I itself
will probably appear somewhere in here
remember though that because this is
just another number exponents work with
it in exactly the same way I to the 5 is
just equal to i times itself five times
or 5 i's multiplied together think you
might see something interesting happen
when you do these also one last note if
you ever feel tempted to write the
square root of one just right I instead</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
