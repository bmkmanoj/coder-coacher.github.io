worth reiterating the time allowances
for each of the stages in rail you mean
laia even better okay okay license for
load idle animations and responsiveness
during the load stage you have about one
second or a thousand milliseconds to
render the page before the app no longer
feels responsive and the users attention
level falls down load and render your
critical resources here after loading
the app is idle and this is a great time
to do non-essential work to ensure that
whatever interactions occur after this
period will feel instantaneous your
app's
idle time should be broken down into 50
millisecond chunks so that you can stop
when the user starts interacting during
the animation stage such as when users
are scrolling or animations are
occurring you only have 16 milliseconds
to render a frame this is when 60 frames
per second is absolutely critical lastly
there's the response period the human
mind has about 100 milliseconds grace
period before an interaction with the
site feels laggy and janky that means
your app needs to respond to user input
in some way within 100 milliseconds
using this time wisely is absolutely
critical for setting up difficult
animations that run at 60 frames a
second in the next few quizzes you'll be
asked to apply what you've learned about
rail in some real-world scenarios</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
