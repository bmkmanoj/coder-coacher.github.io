metadata is overloaded but my videos
gotten popular and so all of these guys
want to download the content from me
which means that everybody is coming to
me and I have an itsy-bitsy server in my
basement and that is going to get
inundated with all of these download
requests from all of these different
clients that want to get this video from
me so there is a metadata overlord and
there is a content overload that is
coming about because of the fact that
something became really hot and
everybody wants to get that content and
this is what is called the origin server
overload in general there are two
solutions to the origin server overload
problem the first solution is to have a
web proxy and you might be familiar with
this already because every organization
tends to have a web proxy so that they
can limit the amount of requests that
have to go out of an organization and
that way if users of an organization are
trying to access popular content from
the internet the local web proxy that's
available in the organization can
directly serve that content to the
requesters but it turns out that the web
proxy solution is not good enough for
what is called a slash dot effect and
that is if there is a breaking news and
everyone wants to get the content they
will have to get the fresh content proxy
is not good enough for that let's say
that there's a Super Bowl going on and
everybody wants to watch the Super Bowl
or at least get latest updates from that
in that case the web proxy is not going
to be good because the content in the
web proxy is a cached content you want
the live content and the live content is
only available at the origin server not
at the proxies and therefore the origin
server will get overloaded when we have
such dynamic content content that is
resulting from either breaking news or
live programming and so on and this is
where the content distribution networks
come into play
the idea is that the content is
automatically mirrored from the origin
server at selected geographical
locations and those locations are
constantly getting updated from the
origin server so that going to any of
the murdered content is the same as
going to the origin server and then what
happens is that in the content
distribution network depending on the
geographical area from which a
particular user request originates the
user request is dynamically rerouted to
the Geo local mirror of the content so
that the origin server need not be
overloaded you may be familiar with
companies like Akamai which have come
aboard for the purposes of providing
content distribution network for popular
content providers like CNN or broadcast
television channels like CBS NBC and so
on and what these organizations that is
the content providers do is get into an
agreement with a content distribution
network provider like Akamai so that
they don't have to worry about origin
server overload because a content
distribution network provider like
Akamai
have the solution for taking the content
of the origin and automatically
mirroring it in geo local sites so that
the origin server never gets overloaded
now this is good if you are a big
organization like CNN or CBS you can
afford to pay the content distribution
network provider to do this automatic
mirroring but how can we demócratas
content distribution how am I in my
basement generating a piece of video and
I want to share it with the world how am
I going to make that available to
everybody if it gets hot I don't want to
get overloaded I want that content
distribution network to work without
having to pay big bucks to a content
distribution network provider like
Akamai and this is where the Kuril
system comes in this is the paper that
I've assigned you to read which has a
technique for démocratie
content distribution and the details of
the Kuril system is what we're going to
look at next
so the Codel system addresses two issues
the first issue is the fact that if I
generate some content and I want to
store the key value pair associated with
the content in a DHT I have to have a
scalable way of doing it without
saturating any particular node which can
serve as a metadata server so we want to
avoid the tree saturation effect and the
second thing that we want to do is also
avoid the origin server overload so both
of those things are being addressed in
providing a democratic solution for
content distribution for the average Joe
that may want to generate some content
and want to share it with the rest of
the world we will look at the details of
the Kuril system in the rest of this
