jay here's the loop that we had before
which used 0 to decide when to quit but
now we want to go as long as there's
another double we can use the has next
double method to ask the scanner if the
next token it has is a double then we
basically want to do the same stuff as
before right asking for input and adding
it to the sum and counting let's just
try this hmm still running still running
okay I think there's a bug here so let's
stop this and look at the code again
where could this have got stuck I've
never seen simple variable assignments
like this get stuck before so I think
that's not the problem now here I check
if there's another double oh there isn't
another double because I haven't asked
for one yet so I'll need to ask the user
for a double before I check if there is
another double and now I'll have to ask
again somewhere in the loop I don't want
to ask immediately because then I'll ask
twice so I probably want to ask at the
end after I process the value I already
asked for let's test this again I can
enter 3 and 4 and 0 well it looks like
this message isn't right yet but if i
add a queue then I get my average back
that's interesting this is the average
of only the first two numbers it didn't
include the zero I guess we're still not
there yet we're only incrementing the
count if the value is not 0 we've also
got this cruft with the done we didn't
need that anymore so I'll take out
everything associated with done now
let's see we have the user enter or
something if it's a number we read it in
add it to the sum count and ask for
another one this is probably what we
wanted now if i enter 3 4 &amp;amp; 0 that's
better</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
