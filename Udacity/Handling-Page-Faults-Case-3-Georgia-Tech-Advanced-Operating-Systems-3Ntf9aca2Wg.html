page is not available in the cluster
memories at all in other words the only
copy exists on the disk so in this case
what has to happen is when we have the
page fault on node P for this X we have
to go to the disk to fetch it and we're
going to fetch it which means that the
working set on node P is growing similar
to the first case and so the local part
is going to go up by one in order to
make room for that I have to necessarily
shrink the global part as in the first
case so I'm going to shrink that global
part by one by the way I can pick any
page from the global part and both in
the first case as well as in this case
we can pick any page from the global
part and send it out to a pure memory
and that's what we're doing here so we
are saying here is a page that I have to
get rid of who do I send it to well I'm
going to send it to the guy that happens
to have the globally oldest page in the
entire cluster so let's say there is
some host R that has the globally oldest
page in the entire cluster and that
globally oldest page in the host R could
be on the local part or the global part
of this host so what we're gonna do is
we're gonna tell that guy hey I'm gonna
give you a page to hold because this
used to be in my global part I don't
have room anymore because my local is
increasing by one because of this page
fault and adding X to my working set now
so please hold on to this page that I'm
gonna give you in your global cache now
this guy has a split like this so if it
has to make room for the new page that
is coming in from its peer clearly it
has to get rid of something where will
it get rid of well it has to throw it on
the disk now the interesting part is if
the oldest page on host R happens to be
in the global cache of our what can we
say about that page Z well it has to be
clean because global part is nothing but
a paging device and therefore if it is
here it must be clean and therefore I
can discard it without worrying about it
just simply dump it drop it on the floor
that's what I'm gonna do on the other
hand if it is on the local part it could
be dirty that is if the oldest page
happens to be on hosts are and it also
happens to be in the local part of hosts
are it is conceivable that this page has
been modified in which case that
modified copy has to be written out to
the disk so in other words when we pick
hosts or to send this replacement page
from my host this guy what he's gonna do
is he's gonna say I have to get rid of a
page in order to make room for this
incoming global page because I have the
globally oldest page and if I have the
globally oldest page then let me get rid
of it by throwing it out onto the disk
if it happens to be dirty if it happens
to be clean simply drop it on the floor
because I know that all the pages are
contained on the disk that's the
fundamental assumption we started with
that all the pages of the currently
active processes are on the disk it is
just that the global cache of every node
is acting as a surrogate for the disk
because it can be faster to access from
the pure memories than from the disk so
similar to the first case in this case
also the local portion of the physical
memory allocation on host P is going to
go up by one and the global portion is
going to go down by one what about hosts
are well it really depends if the oldest
page on hosts are happens to be in the
global cache then there is no change
because I am creating the old page Z for
another page that is coming in from host
P that is why that is coming in in that
case there's no change in the allocation
between local and global on host R but
on the other hand if the globally oldest
page happens to be from the local part
of host R what that means is that even
though originally we thought Z to be
part of the working set of hosts are
clearly the processes that we're using
it are either no longer active or they
completed or whatever and therefore we
growing out this page the local part is
shrinking if the local part on host R is
shrinking what that means is I can use
more of the memory that's available in
host R for community service that's the
important message I should get out
that's the important message I want you
to get out of looking at this particular
page fault scenario</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
