XML visualizer the things you can do in
the visualizer you can also do the
Android studio and a lot lot lot more as
such Android studio might look a little
bit complicated but to start making an
application you actually only need to
know a few of the core functionalities
so really don't worry if you don't know
what every single button does
I still look things up and I sure don't
know what every single button in Android
studio does ok I'm going to go down here
and click the text tab looking at this
middle part of the screen I want you to
think of this as being something similar
to a document editor such as Google Docs
in Google Docs you open a file and you
edit that file in Android studio you
open a project which contains many files
and you can edit any of the files within
the project if we go over here to the
left hand side we can see all the
folders and files that are inside of our
project if I go over to a folder and
click it it shows me the subfolders if I
double click a file it opens a tab for
that file here's where you could edit
the file and the tabs across are for
switching back and forth between
different files I'm going to go ahead
and close this file that i just opened
by clicking the little X up here as
you're editing things in Android studio
it does the work of automatically saving
your work now if I do something really
disastrous like whoops I accidentally
select all this and then delete it
always remember that you can undo and
redo in Android studio I'm going to undo
that by going up here to the menu bar
and clicking edit undo now you can see
right below it that we have redo
alternatively if you don't want to use
the menu bar you could use the keyboard
shortcut ctrl Z or add Max command Z and
to redo its command shift Z or ctrl
shift C let's take a closer look at the
left hand side here everything here
combined makes up your app an app or an
application on Android isn't a single
file it's a collection of images layouts
and other code note that if you go up
here you can select a few different ways
to view the files and folders in your
app project in particular shows you what
the folders actually look like on your
computer I'll click down a bit so that
you can see alright not to scare you but
when you made your app there's actually
a ton of
folders and files that were generated
for you to simplify things
I usually just stick with the Android
view which is a little easier to
navigate now back when you made your
project you chose where the project is
going to be saved if you ever forget you
can look up here at the menu bar which
reminds you where your project is saved
and if you're feeling particularly brave
you should feel free to even take a peek
at what this folder structure actually
looks like on your computer for example
on a Mac machine I could go to my home
folder and then go to Android studio
projects and then you see this happy
birthday folder and this contains all of
the project files and folders for the
application so if I were to delete this
folder or move this folder it would
really mess up things for Android studio
okay so what we're going to be working
with is the activity main.xml file it's
located in the layout folder because it
contains xml that has the design or
layout of your application i'm going to
double click now the contents of this
file should look pretty familiar it's
very very similar to the sort of xml
that we were writing in the lesson one
big difference are these two attributes
here the xmlns attribute says that we're
working with attributes that are
specific to Android development and
making layouts XML is also used with
websites storing data and other
applications so we use this XML and s
attribute to specify that we're making
things particularly for Android
development and particularly for layouts
the fact that we use the word Android
here is also the reason that we put
Android colon in front of all the
attributes that we use if you'd like to
learn a little bit more about the xmlns
attribute you can check out the
instructor notes the important thing to
know is when you make a new application
these two things will be automatically
included and you should include them in
any other layouts you make otherwise
your application won't work all right
now down here you're going to see two
tabs the design tab in the text tab and
the text tab is actually the tab that
you're usually going to be working with
over here on the far right you'll see
that there's a button that says preview
if you click on it it'll remove the
picture of the phone and if you click it
on again it'll bring the picture of the
phone back this is a preview of what
your XML looks like on a phone
it's very similar to the XML visualizer
I'm actually going to go ahead and
change the text attribute here to say
goodbye world
now if you do this on your own machine
and you zoom in here let me do it now
you should see that the text updated to
say goodbye world pretty cool if you
click on the design tab you'll see a
drag-and-drop interface for designing
phone layouts so for example I can drag
things over into the application over
here in this area called component tree
it's going to list all of the different
views that I have if I click on a
particular view down here in properties
it shows me all of the different
attributes or properties that I can
change this list can be pretty helpful
for discovering new layout properties
also if you right-click on any of these
properties such as this align start
it'll give you an option to see the
documentation this design view is pretty
helpful if you're trying to quickly
build a layout but you get a lot more
control over exactly where different
elements go if you understand and know
how to write code since we don't really
need any of these additional options and
don't know what a lot of them do yet
it's easier to just stick with the text
tab that concludes a quick tour of
Android studio next we'll work on
running our first app</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
