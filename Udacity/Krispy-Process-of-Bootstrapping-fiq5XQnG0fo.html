different for every individual or
business that's trying to do it but in
essence i think it breaks down into a
few core phases one identification of
need i need money or i need this thing I
need this value once you've identified
what that is that kind of turns into
your goal then it's what do I have that
can help me get that thing that I've
identified that I need so if it's money
hey I maybe need more customers how do I
get more customers well I have this
stuff that's in my inventory or I have
the skill that I can apply or I have
this resource that I can break down into
smaller pieces and sell something that
you have at your disposal already that
you can then scale its value rapidly and
then it's the active actually doing that
in following through and while doing
that figuring out how to turn it into a
sustainable offering so that way it
doesn't just die out over time so to
summarize it's three phases
identification a problem location and
allocation of immediate resources and
the third thing that's important that
kind of encompasses the other two is
figuring out the longevity of whatever
it is you've done summary of
bootstrapping is identifying what what
you want what's your goal what is the
thing that you are trying to achieve
second thing is looking for that item or
skill or talent or resource that that
thing that will generate the value for
you and the third thing is identifying
how you can turn that into a sustainable
platform to continue that growth into
the future</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
