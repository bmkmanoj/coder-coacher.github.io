diving into a couple of examples I
wanted to remind you of a conversation
that we had earlier does this little
picture look familiar to you it looks
like the Monte Carlo tree search stuff
we talked about in the options lesson it
actually is so here's the point that I
wanted Madame made the point of time but
I wanted to really kind of drive it home
here if you recall i asked you to come
up with some options for solving pacman
and you came up with four of them you
remember what they were yeah I think
they're on the slide fortunately I had
to serve to remember what they mean it's
like eat with three different bullets
and they're getting successively larger
but I think it's actually food pellet
power pellet monster or ghost and then
avoid ghost and avoid goes right and as
we recall at the time we you know
briefly discussed that these things
really do look like options and this
last one doesn't really look like an
option in the sense that it doesn't have
a goal and there's something you can
succeed you can in some sense only fail
and this turned out to be interesting
for a couple of reasons one just because
you came up with them and in fact we've
done this study on multiple multiple
humans and various levels of expertise
and basically they all come up with the
same for sometimes they'll come up with
a fifth it kind of distinguishes between
eating a real ghost that's edible and a
ghost that isn't edible and that kind of
thing but basically they come with these
same for and the point here and why I
wanted to bring it up is that if you
just ask people to give you what they
know you ask them to communicate you ask
them to coach an agent they will often
come up with things that are different
from what your machine expects in the
the sort of claim I want to make is that
often in research what we do is we come
up with wonderful machine learning
algorithms decide what information they
need and then try to force humans to
give us that information but actually
human beings will naturally sometimes
give us that information but often will
give us different kind of information
and if you look at it the wrong way you
would say well look these three are
useful this last one can't be
implemented so I'm going to ignore it
but in fact even in the Monte Carlo tree
search example this last one this
constraint actually helped us develop a
better algorithm because it gave us a
better rollout strategy and in fact as
the students listening will know because
they've read the paper on this that we
made available that it actually improves
performance and amazing amount so the
point of this is
that when we asked humans to communicate
to be a part of the sort of team of how
we teach and demonstrate to our agents
we need to meet them where they are as
opposed to try to force them to meet us
where our algorithms are and I want to
give you just a couple of examples of
that that sound fair yeah that's really
cool cool alright so the first one is
going to be something called policy
shaping and as a preview just want you
to know the whole point of this is to
say that all this stuff you talked about
with reward shaping was wrong oh yeah
let's take a look</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
