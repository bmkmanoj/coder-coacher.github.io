are two different versions of the ABO
gene sequence at the 796 position in the
human population and it turns out that
the variation that results in a leucine
at this amino acid position codes for
blood type a in human beings so if you
have anything that produces a leucine
here this is associated with blood type
a in humans but if you have the
variation that results in Amethi anine
or an M at this position for an amino
acid then that results in a B blood type
for humans so we might call one of these
variations the a version and the other
one the B version but in genetics we
actually have a word to describe these
kinds of variants we call them alleles
and allele is just another word for
variant alleles are just variations of
genes the gene is the ABO gene but we
have two different variants we have one
variant with an adenine or an A at
position 796 and another variant with a
thymine or T at position 796 so we would
call this an allele with an A that
causes B blood type and an allele T that
causes the a blood type as you can
imagine we could have many different
alleles we can change nucleotides all
over the place anywhere we want and
that's effectively producing different
alleles because they're variations in a
gene so we're going to start simple and
talk about one or two variations one or
two alleles but for any trade any gene
you can build up to virtually as many
alleles as there are positions in the
gene what I've done is listed the actual
type a blood type a alleles and the
blood type B alleles changing from a CGC
to a GGC at GGC to an AGC and I've done
the same thing for the amino acids that
are associated with these alleles the
type-a alleles from loosing the
methionine glycine alanine arginine
glycine glycine Assyrian the change from
the type A to the type B alleles what I
want you to do is tell me which of the
variants the genetic variants are
associated with the changes in the amino
acids I've numbered them 1 2 3 and 4 and
I want you to put the number in the
correct box
that shows the the correct amino acid
change with the correct change in the
genetic sequence here remember use the
genetic code I'm not putting it in the
screen here because there's not enough
room but you can click on a link in the
instructors notes to get a bigger
