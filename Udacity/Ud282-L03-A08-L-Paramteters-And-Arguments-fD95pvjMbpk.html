program and can have it print out songs
and choruses pretty easily but now we
want to improve our code by including a
greeting at the beginning of each song
when musicians are on tour they'll often
say hello to each city or place they
perform in they'll say hello New York or
hello Mexico City and that's what we
want our greeting function to do so
let's write a greeting function that can
say hello to unique locations we want to
customize our code to greet each place
individually by the locations name we
can start by writing a function called
greeting that prints out hello and then
the name of a location like New York but
we'll want to be able to change this
location to greet wherever we are so far
we've just seen functions work using
internal information like variables or
values we type in but this time we want
to be able to give our function
information from the outside world
outside of this definition we want to
give it the location of a performance
and have it respond we can input data
like a location into our function by
using something called parameters
parameters are variables that we can
place inside the parentheses of our
function definition that our function
can then use for our custom greeting
we'll want to be able to input and use a
string variable that tells us our
location to access this string we'll
need to ask for it by including it as a
parameter inside these parentheses and
now we can use this variable location
inside our function code this is like
when we declared a variable inside our
function and could use it the main
difference is that any variables we've
declared inside our functions can only
be accessed and used inside that
function and nowhere else and this
parameter location is referring to
information that can exist outside the
scope of our function so now we can
include this location string in our
greeting message and instead of saying
hello New York we can say hello plus
location and use string concatenation to
print out a unique message for each
location but now when I call this
function greeting I can't just type
greeting with empty parentheses and
that's because this function expects a
string location as input so in my
function call I have to put in a string
like the location New York and the
specific input is called an argument so
parameters are the variables inside our
function definition like string location
and argument
are the actual values that are passed
into our function when we call it like
New York which our function needs to
work when we call our function our
argument has to match the type of
parameter we expect in our function so
in this case New York has to be a string
now if I put in the string New York as
the argument in our function call Java
will look at our function definition and
assign this value to our string location
and our function call will print out a
greeting that's unique to this location
hello New York great and I can repeat
this code and input any other location I
want our greeting function will accept
any string input and string location
will be assigned its value so if I call
greeting and pass in the string Mexico
City the print output will be hello
Mexico City now we can call our greeting
function and pass in different string
locations to it every time this is just
like we've been doing with print Lin by
passing at different strings each time
in our next quiz we'll see more examples
of how parameters can be useful</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
