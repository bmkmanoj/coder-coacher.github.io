it so far
you really learn the ball boat slam you
learn about the map which is the
sequence of coordinates and you learn
about localization in LNM are really
important let us hear the simultaneous
in the end I'm not that essential we put
all of those into a big matrix Omega in
a vector C and every time we got some
relative information between poses we
carved or some stuff in here or we
measured something we added some stuff
in here and over here these were all
just additions and as we now understand
let us implement the straightforward
constraints that come from the motion in
the measurements and then the key thing
was that we could solve with a simple
piece of equation for the path and the
map at the same time there was quite an
amazing achievement so we've implemented
this you've implemented your first slam
algorithm there it goes way beyond
anything I ever taught students at
Stanford in a single class
congratulations for doing this so this
is the last and final class I'm going to
output a challenge to everybody briefly
where you can write a robot program that
puts most of the stuff we talked about
together but for now congratulations for
making it so far that is really
impressive</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
