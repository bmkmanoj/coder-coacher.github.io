billion and if we assume we have a 2.4
gigahertz computer which is fairly
typical then if all this could be
compiled into one computer instruction
then it would take 10 seconds but of
course that's ridiculous you can't do
all of that in one instruction if it was
a hundred instructions then that mean
would mean it would be a thousand
seconds which is about 16 minutes but
that seems too little probably going to
be more like a thousand instructions to
make all the way through doing all this
and then checking the constraints and so
that would be about one hundred and
sixty minutes and so an hour to three
hours you know maybe we say two or three
hours somewhere in there it might be as
little as one hour we can't really tell
because it's just an estimate but it's
definitely going to be in the hour range
and not in the minutes or day range now
in fact I actually ran this program and
we'll come back later and see how well
this estimate of somewhere in there
worked out let me just say because we've
learned that this will take somewhere on
the range of an hour don't try to run it
here in the browser by hitting the Run
button because we timeout the
calculations after just a few seconds so
it's not going to work here you could
type it into your own computer if you
have Python running on your own computer
set it going and see how it works but
first we have to figure out how to do
all the constraints so we already
constraint number one which was houses
equals 1 2 3 4 5 now let's do constraint
number two which is that the English man
lives in the red house and we want to
write some if statement to check if the
Englishman lives in the red house and if
so we go on if not we give up and so how
do we check if it's true that the
Englishman lives in the red house so if
and then I want you to fill in some
expression here and we'll just say that
this is constraint number two so tell me
what you could put in here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
