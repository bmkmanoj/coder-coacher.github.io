that are easy or hard for optimizers to
solve
let us talk for a moment about a
particular class of problems that are
indeed the most easy for these types of
algorithms to solve and those are called
convex problems here's the formal
definition of a convex function I'm
going to read it to you from Wikipedia
and then I'll show you what it means on
these graphs here a real-valued function
f of X defined on an interval is called
convex if the line segment between any
two points on the graph of the function
lies above the graph okay a lot of words
there let me show you what that means
more easily first step choose two points
and draw a line between them now for
each of these lines if the line is above
the graph everywhere between those two
points then the function is convex
between those points so for this
function yes its convex because the line
is above the graph everywhere in fact
any two points you choose on this graph
will have that property us so this this
function is convex everywhere at least
where we're looking at it here notice
that this part of the graph lies above
the line so this is non convex similarly
this one we've got this region here that
lies above the line so this one is also
non convex and this one is of course
convex so a couple things to observe
here some properties that emerge one is
in order for the function to be convex
it has to have only one local minima and
in other words that local minima is the
global minima this one fails for that
reason we also can't have any flat
regions that essentially don't have any
slope downward now if the function
you're
trying to find a minimum of four is
convex then these algorithms will find
the minima quickly and easily but again
there are algorithms that can still find
the minima for more complicated examples
like these but they require a little bit
of randomness and they aren't
necessarily guaranteed to find the
global minima so far we've been looking
at functions that just have one
dimension in X so for instance the
parabola that we looked at it's just as
easy for these optimizers to work in
multiple dimensions here's an example of
a function that has two dimensions in X
it still has its Y result but the
minimizer's can solve these problems
with gradient descent just as easily so
instead of just one dimension we can
have one two three four as many as we'd
like</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
