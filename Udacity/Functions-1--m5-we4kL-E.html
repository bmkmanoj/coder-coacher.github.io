function syntax and some of the other
things we've seen with functions we
noted that a basic function starts with
the funk keyword and then a function
name and then anything we want in the
body of the function goes in between the
curly braces here some other formats you
may see or like this one that takes one
integer parameter and you can see it's
type int indicated here in this last
example we see takes multiple parameters
we have one integer parameter and then a
second integer parameter as we've
mentioned and you've probably noticed
you've been using functions since the
maze app here are two examples of the
print function and you notice I here on
the right side we can see what's being
printed out or you can include these
bubbles to blow it out into the middle
of the playground next let's see an
example of defining our own functions
say hello this function takes no
parameters and it prints out hello
nothing too complex here let's take this
one step forward and look at a function
that takes a parameter if we scroll down
a little bit we'll see this is the
function say hello to student and all
this boilerplate code up here at the top
is to create a student's drugs and
initialize some students truck instances
and then in the body of the function
we've taken the student parameter and
we're printing out its name and since
it's called multiple times if we click
this little white circle here to blow it
out we see the very last print out but
if you click value history we can see
all three of the printouts because of
these function calls here in this next
example we have the same student struct
we have a new function called greet
student and it takes multiple parameters
it takes one student parameter and then
abilene parameter called late for class
to call this function we write the
function name greet student followed by
our student struct instance in this case
Gabrielle and then we need the external
parameter name which for this boolean
value is late for class and then a
boolean value in this case false and
here we see the output of the three
function calls let's move on to naming
parameters I really want to focus on
this section the code here at the top is
the same as before we define a student
struct and then we create some students
truck instances but the function
definition is where things really get
interesting for the student parameter we
specified both an external name
and an internal name and then the late
for class by default uses the same
internal and external name late for
class so we can see here at the bottom
for all three of these function calls
were using the external names for both
parameters and remember by default the
very first parameter normally doesn't
use an external parameter name unless
you explicitly specify one now I want to
show you something that took me a really
long time to understand when i was
looking at apple's documentation when
you're going to be doing this more and
more we haven't started to talk about
classes yet the classes can have
functions known as methods that are
associated with them this is the UI view
controller class and let's pick one of
its methods I'm going to search for view
will disappear if we click view will
disappear it'll blow out all the extra
information about this particular method
so we can look at its swift definition
here at the top notice how the function
takes one parameter animated and for an
external name it uses an underscore when
you see this in Apple's documentation it
means that the default external
parameter name should be used and
remember since this is the first
parameter the default external name for
it is nothing it just is omitted because
it's the first parameter and notice the
view will disappear does not use any
external parameter name and that's the
default behavior for the first parameter
and that's it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
