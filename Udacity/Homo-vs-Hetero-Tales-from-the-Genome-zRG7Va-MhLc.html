alleles we realized in the last exercise
that we can get three possible allelic
combinations in this case to cytosine
cytosine and thymine or tooth I means we
might just say ccct or TT now in
genetics there's a more traditional way
of writing this kind of information
because each allele is technically on a
different chromosome we actually
separate the two alleles with the slash
because sometimes when we're discussing
genetic information among geneticists
there's always a need to distinguish
okay are we talking about information on
the same chromosome or information on
different chromosomes so as a common way
of distinguishing this the practice
arose to put a slash here and so that's
how we're going to actually refer to two
different alleles from here on out in
our class c / c although i'll probably
just say CC okay now there are two very
important patterns that have just
emerged that are really important for us
to define because we're going to keep
coming back to them throughout the whole
of the course although we have three
possible combinations of the alleles
there are two specific types of
combinations we have the homozygous
combination meaning that we have the
same alleles in the pair so in this case
we have to side of scenes or two
diamonds these would be the homozygous
conditions and we have the heterozygous
combination meaning different alleles in
the combination so in this case we have
one heterozygous option the cytosine
thymine pair so having two alleles
allows three allelic combinations where
two of them are homozygous and one of
them is a heterozygous combination but
let's imagine for a second just
completely hypothetically that there was
a third allele at the same genetic
position where there's now a guanine or
a G instead of a cytosine or thymine of
all the possible allelic combinations
that we could get out of these three
alleles I want you to tell me would you
Leela combinations would be considered
heterozygous but go ahead and check any
and all boxes that you think apply</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
