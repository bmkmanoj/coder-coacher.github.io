see that the trait of lactose
intolerance doesn't appear in every
generation in fact it looks like it
skips generations I've heard of genes
skipping generations before like male
pattern baldness or cystic fibrosis
exactly there are lots of examples of
traits that do this but it's important
to know there are also other traits that
do appear in every generation where many
of the family members show the same
phenotype how do they do that is there
something different genetically well
we'll get to that but the first thing we
need to do is better described these
inheritance patterns and to do that
we're going to pull on knowledge and all
the lessons we've had up to this point
particularly the idea of an allele so
wait let's go over what an allele is
again an allele is just a version of a
gene that can cause a version of a trait
for example one allele may promote blue
eyes and another allele may promote
brown eyes that's right and I have two
one for mom one from dad exactly it's
important for us to keep that in mind as
we go through this lesson as it's going
to be a very key concept we have two
copies of every gene and we can have
different alleles of a gene but
different alleles don't always cause the
same kind of trait</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
