confusing signifier it's this door plate
thing well actually I'm not sure what to
call it because this is a door handle
and this I thought was something I could
push on to open the door and I can't
know no matter how hard I push it I
can't well it turns out it's not a door
this is a wall a glass wall and they put
this plate here and I thought I could
push on it and I can't so that's a
confusing signifier now let's look at
that for a second why is it so well it
seems that there's a lock mechanism here
and the lock mechanism see inside is
about this big well I think the designer
wanted to have some symmetry so they
made these two plates the same size but
in so doing so they have kind of an
aesthetic form there but they've created
a function or a false signifier that is
confusing so how might we make this
better
well let's see let's assume we want to
hide the lock maybe we just want to make
this smaller and keep this symmetry here
so we might make a plate this big well
that would be really too small to put my
whole hand on it I don't think I would
confuse that for a plate or if I just
wanted to hide the lock maybe I could
make something really small like that
either way it would be a little bit
better because I feel like if I push
this too hard I might actually do some
damage to this glass wall</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
