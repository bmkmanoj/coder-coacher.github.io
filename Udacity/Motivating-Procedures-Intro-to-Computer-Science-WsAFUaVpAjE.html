what's called procedural abstraction
this is a really powerful idea this is
one of the ways we avoid having to do
things over and over again by hand is
that we can write the code right at once
and use it many times changing the
inputs to get different behaviors so if
you look at each segment of code here
these lines were copied exactly the same
way we did the same thing over and over
again the same five lines of code to
find the start of a link in page to find
the start and then quote and then
extract the URL and then to print the
URL the only thing that was different
was the value of page we kept updating
the value of page we did that as we went
through the code we updated the value of
page with this assignment and before
this one we updated the value of page
with this assignment so the idea behind
procedural abstraction is that anything
that we're doing over and over again we
want to abstract we want to make it a
procedure and we want to make the things
that change inputs so that means instead
of having to type all this code over and
over again we want to make page and
input pages the input that's something
that changes and we want to make the URL
that's the result we want an output so
that's our goal is to turn this into a
procedure where pages the input we can
do the same code over and over again and
every time we do it we want to get this
URL value as the output</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
