existing God plugins that we can use so
let's install them as project
dependencies execute NPM install gapps s
in your terminal which we install the
plugins that we can use in a knockout
file now we have to change the folder
structure slightly to account for the
generated CSS output files create a new
folder in your project directory and
call it says now move the files may not
see us as an extra CSS from the CSS
folder into the sass folder and rename
the extension to dot scss we just turn
them into sass files that soon got
compiled into a CSS file with our new
task into the now empty CSS directory
okay before we can use the garb sass
plugin we need to make it available to
God this works exactly as expected just
required as dependency right of the gulp
moving on we create a new task and name
it styles which is what the first
argument is for the second function as
previously is executed when a task is
called now we just need to tell god what
files we wanted to work with put up God
has a special command called sauce on
the garb object the line i just added
looks for files with the dot scss
extension in the SAS folder and any
potential sub directories now that we
have the files we piped into sass the
pipe function on the stream of files we
just created takes the destination of
the plugin provides so we call it says
right here the good news is that we have
converted our files from sales to proper
CSS now the bad news is that we haven't
saved them anywhere so finally we use
pipe again and use the gulp desk
function to specify our final
destination the CSS folder this is all
we have to do to make it work but by
default the whole build will stop an
error out when SAS discovers an error
that's not always what you want very
often it's better to finish and actually
that you see whatever happened many
plugins such like guard cells emit
events for the scenario listening to the
error event on the sass object and
inserting this as log error function
here changes the default behavior
instead of killing the whole build it
tells gulp to simply log the error and
go on as usual this looks much better
now let's remove the CSS error and try
running gub styles in a terminal
see how the CSS files came back into
your CSS folder these are now generated
from the original SAS files that would
be a great time to get familiar with SAS
if you haven't already just to give you
an example I can now go ahead and nest
my sis s to clean it up first mission
