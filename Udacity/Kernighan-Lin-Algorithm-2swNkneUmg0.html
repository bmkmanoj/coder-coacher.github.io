you need to know to understand the full
Colonel hen Lin algorithm recall the
setup you're given a graph and a
partition of its vertices v1 and v2
you'll try to improve this partition by
swapping two subsets of the elements x1
and x2 so how do you choose x1 and x2
here's the KL procedure first compute
the internal and external costs for
every vertex next mark all the nodes as
unvisited then carry out an iterative
procedure I'll fill this condition in
momentarily go through every pair of
unmarked vertices and pick the one with
the largest gain mark that pair as
visited now go through and update all
the internal and external costs as if a
and B had been swamped note that you
aren't actually swapping a and B just
updating the costs as if you had done so
then repeat this procedure until you
visited all the vertices at this point
the algorithm has computed a sequence of
gains that is this is the first part of
the algorithm and the output of the
first part is the sequence of gains now
for the next part of the algorithm let's
define something called the cumulative
gain that's gained with a capital G the
capital G gain is the sum of all the
little gains up to a certain point J
Kearney hands and Lin's idea was to keep
all the swaps that maximize the
cumulative gain if this cumulative gain
is nonzero then you have a candidate x1
and x2 subsets that actually improve the
partition you can then swap these two
subsets and update the overall cost now
for the last detail you'll repeat the
entire procedure we've just described
parts 1 and part 2 until there is no
more gain in other words if this
condition is false then the algorithm
terminates oh boy that was a lot of
steps but hopefully the general idea is
clear now the main issue with this
algorithm is its cost it's sequential
running time is Big O of V squared times
D where again D is the maximum degree of
any vertex there are actually some more
complex variations of this algorithm
that can
Douce the per iteration cost to Big O of
the number of edges anyway for more of
my notes on analyzing the overall cost
