we encountered three computer scientists
as I hope you'll remember Alice Bob and
Carol and as you recall they all three
were working on rather tough problems
for which they weren't able to find an
efficient algorithm
Alice was working in telecommunications
and her task was for the network of her
employer to find the minimum number of
monitoring devices that needed to be
installed to monitor all cables in the
telecommunications network Bob was
working in bioinformatics and his job
was to find clusters of data in genetic
analysis and finally Carol was working
in finance and she has been tasked with
selecting a portfolio of assets that
consists of as many assets as possible
but it has to observe a number of
restrictions which acids she can put
together in one portfolio now at the end
of the last unit we stated these
problems as problems on graphs and we're
going to do a little recall quiz here to
see if you remember which problems they
were working on when we state this as a
graph problem the three problems we were
looking at were called independent set
clique and vertex cover and all of those
three problems took as input a graph
with n vertices for independent set you
were then looking for the maximum number
of vertices where none of those vertices
you have selected are connected to each
other for clique you were looking for a
maximum number of vertices where all of
them are connected and for vertex cover
we were looking for a minimum number of
vertices to cover all edges meaning that
every edge must have at least one
endpoint in the set of vertices that we
selected so here's our first twist and I
would like to see if you remember which
of these computer scientists so Alice
working in telecommunications Bob
working in bioinformatics and Carol
working in finance which of these
computer scientists were working on
which of these problems here and the way
I want you to answer this is for each of
the problems to select if that was the
problem that Alice was working on the
problem that Bob was working on or the
problem that Carol was working on and
the same here for clique and vertex
cover</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
