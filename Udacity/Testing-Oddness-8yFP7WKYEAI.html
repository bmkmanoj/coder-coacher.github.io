I've chosen one that tests the oddness
of a binary representation of a natural
number note that I've cheated here in
the transition function by including
only state symbol pairs in the domain
that we would actually encounter during
computation by convention if no
transition is specified for the current
state symbol pair then the program just
halts in the reject state one convenient
way to represent the transition function
by the way is with a state diagram
similar to what is often used for a
finite automata for those familiar with
that model of computation each state
gets its own vertex in a multi graph and
every row of the transition table is
represented as an edge the edge gets
labeled with the remaining information
besides the two states that is it gets
the symbol red followed by an arrow then
the symbol to write and the direction to
move the head now let's trace through
the operation of this Turing machine on
this input 1 0 1 1 the head first reads
a one from the tape and marin state q0
so i go up here and consult the
transition table and here i see that i
should follow this edge since that has
state q0 and we read a 1 and this
transition tells me that I should write
a 1 or leave the tape alone and move the
head to the right and change the state
to q0 so let's go ahead and update our
figure we're still in state q0 and the
position of the head has been moved one
space to the right so this becomes our
new configuration in the next step will
read a 0 consulting the transition
diagram we see that this means that we
should leave the 0 alone and move the
head to the right again and stay in
state q0 we read a one from the tape and
that means we follow this transition
here and move the head to the right
again and the next step is similar
finally the head reads a blank symbol
the transition table tells us to write a
blank symbol and move the head to the
left and to switch the state to q1 now
we read the symbol under the head
that's a one so we followed this
transition rule here and we end up in an
accept state</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
