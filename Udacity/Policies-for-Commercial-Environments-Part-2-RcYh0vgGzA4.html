policies or models that make sense for
commercial environments I'm going to
start with what is called the Clark
Wilson policy so Clark Wilson policy
says that users should be able to access
certain programs or applications objects
are constrained and you know certain
objects can only be accessed by certain
programs so the ways you think about the
policy is that you know somebody says
this user should have access to this
application and somebody says this
application should have access to these
objects so that's what the user can then
gain access to those objects and only by
running only when they are running those
applications so if I want separation of
Duty for example where the same person
should not be able to due to conflict or
two things that potentially could lead
to to fraud then we can just say that
you know user Alice you cannot execute
both of those applications she can do
one and somebody else will need to do be
able to run the other application and
that's how we separate the two duties
associated with the two applications
that we have here the child it's a Clark
Wilson essentially you know it was
developed for commercial settings the
second one is more about the conflict of
interest requirement how we address that
and the name of the policy is called
Chinese wall policy and you'll see why
this is an appropriate name for it so
this deals as I said with conflict of
interests and and what you can access or
cannot access depends on what you have
seen so far so what you've seen so far
if it has no conflict with you know the
next thing you're asking for then it's
okay if not you know we're going to deny
access so how do we decide when do you
have a conflict or or or the absence of
that conflict of interest to explain
this conflict of interests and the
Chinese wall policy a little bit more
let's say we have documents in on a
system now some documents are financial
documents that pretend two different
banks so Chase Wells Fargo Bank of
America whatever it is so this grouping
here these are all the documents that
are for bank of america these all the
documents over
fargo and so on similarly we have other
documents that pretend to let oil
companies so some documents are x on
others shell chevron and so on the
reason we have this outer box around all
the bank documents or the oil company
documents is that this is a conflict
class Chase has a conflict with Wells
Fargo because they're in the same kind
of business they compete with each other
so the conflict class is you know these
documents form the conflict class
similarly Exxon would have a conflict
with shell and chevron so these
documents are in this other conflict
class okay so Chinese wall policy
basically says a user can access any
object as long as he or she has not
accessed an object from another company
in the same conflict class so let's say
user Alice axises X on a document
pertaining to acts on so you can because
so far she is accessed nothing so there
is no conflict that that we can see as
soon as he accesses a document from this
class from Exxon she cannot access
anything in these other classes that are
in the same conflict class so she can't
access something that belongs to shell
or chevron can see you know then go and
access the document that pretends to
chase yes that's in a different conflict
class there is no conflict between chase
and Exxon Alice can access this and this
but as soon as he does chase seek on
taxes Wells Fargo so you can basically
access any oil company in any back but
not to oil companies and not to banks at
the same time so we basically creating
these walls around sets of documents
okay that the conflict exists across
those and and that's why it's called the
Chinese wall policy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
