that are similar to what we did before
for the kalman okay since I know some of
you have a machine learning background a
little bit drawn here is a graphical
model the idea is that X is only
impacted by what the X was before and
what the new perturbation is and the Z's
the measurements are only a function of
the current state all right and that's
written in the following way right the
first thing says the probability of the
measurement given all the states given
all my history is only a function of the
current state and that sometimes called
sensor independence okay the sensing is
only dependent on the current state all
right the other element is this one that
says the probability of the next state
given all of these things that came in
and including the states before is only
a function of where we were before plus
the current input and by the way here
this is written as UT not the UT minus
one that's why I was telling you about
before this shame on me because I did
both of these and I should have made
them consistent but the idea this is the
Markovian property right we have we have
the Markovian property last time also
the Markovian property says if I know
the state at the last time
none of the earlier state information
none of the earlier measurements none of
the earlier anything matter except the
state then and there's one thing we've
added new this time is action at the
current time okay that's the Markovian
property</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
