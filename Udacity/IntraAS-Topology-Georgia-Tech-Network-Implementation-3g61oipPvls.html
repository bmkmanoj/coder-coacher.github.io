let's take a look at what a topology
might look like inside a single
autonomous system the topology inside an
a s consists of nodes and edges that
connect them the nodes are sometimes
called points of presence or pops a pop
is typically located in a dense
population center so that it can be
close to the Pops of other providers for
easier interconnection and also close to
other customers for cheaper backhaul to
customers that may be purchasing
connectivity from this particular a s
the edges between pops are typically
constrained by the location of fiber
paths which for the sake of convenience
typically parallel major transportation
routes such as railroads and highways
here's an example of a single a s
topology which is the Abilene Network
which is a research network in the
United States each of these locations
would be considered a pop and each of
these pops may have one or more edges
between them Georgia Tech is an
autonomous system that connects at the
Atlanta pop of the Abilene Network
here's a close-up of the Abilene network
in the southeastern US the Abilene
network connects to other universities
in the southeast near Atlanta at an
internet exchange point called Sox or
Southern Cross roads now thus far we've
just talked about the topology of an
autonomous system which essentially
defines the graph the next step is to
compute paths over that topology a
process called routing routing is the
process by which nodes discover where to
forward traffic so that it reaches a
certain node there are two types of
intradomain routing one is called
distance vector and the other is called
link state and the rest of this lesson
will explore the two different types of
intradomain routing and the advantages
and disadvantages of each of them let's
first take a look at distance vector
routing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
