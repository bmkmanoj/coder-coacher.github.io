involved in a particular trait we
conduct something called a genetic
Association study
now these studies take people with a
trait for example a skin condition and
really they take a whole population of
people with this trait and they compare
their genetics to an individual or
really a group of individuals without
this particular trait in this case
without the skin condition now what
we're going to do is look at a genetic
factor or more and we're gonna see which
variants each population has now if a
certain genetic variant is observed more
frequently than you would expect by
chance in the actual cases than the
controls then it's good evidence that it
might be involved in the trait suppose
that we have a thousand people that have
a particular kind of skin rash and we
compare them to a thousand people that
don't have this particular kind of skin
rash now let's say we analyze these two
populations for one particular genetic
factor and let's say we determined that
fifty percent of the population with the
skin rash has a cytosine for this
genetic factor at a given position and
that in the control population only
twenty percent have a cytosine now at
that same position the only other option
that we can have is an adenine and our
affected population the other 50% the
remaining 50 percent have an adenine and
in our control population the remaining
in this case 80 percent have the adenine
now we have a lot of people in our
population a thousand if this letter was
insignificant to this particular trait
we would expect that with so many people
that these numbers would be more similar
50 50 50 50 or 20 80 20 80 in both
situations in other words these
differences are greater than what we
would expect to see by chance so based
on the scenario here I want you to tell
me which of the following is the most
reasonable conclusion</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
