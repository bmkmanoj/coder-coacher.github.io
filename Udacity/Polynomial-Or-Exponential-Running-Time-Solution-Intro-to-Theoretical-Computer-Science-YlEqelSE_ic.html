1/2 to the power of n times the
logarithm of n that is clearly an
exponential running time because 2 to
the power of n is exponential now what
about the next one 2 to the power of the
logarithm of n well 2 to the power of
the logarithm of n is actually oh of n
because so having the logarithm and the
exponent will actually cancel out the
exponent so that is o of n so although
it might look exponential if you don't
look closely enough that is actually a
polynomial running time now o of one
point zero zero zero zero one to the
power of n that is going to be a very
very slowly growing function but
nevertheless it's exponential so this is
the correct answer and n to the power of
1,000 that's basically the opposite it's
a polynomial that will grow rapidly fast
and you would never want an algorithm
actually with that running time but
nevertheless it is a polynomial running
time Alice's algorithm well you already
figured that out I guess because it's
two to the power of n times N squared
that's an exponential running time
algorithm that's why it's really bad now
as you see with those two examples here
there's something to be said about
saying that we consider polynomial
running time to be acceptable and
exponential running time to be
unacceptable but in general what you
will find is that polynomial time
algorithms tend to have a running time
of N squared or n to the power of three
so there's not really any algorithm that
I would know of at least none that makes
sense that has a running time like this
so it's kind of okay from empirical
experience to call a polynomial time
algorithm actually one with a acceptable
running time and the same thing is with
exponential running time so you'll when
you have an exponential time algorithm
you will not have one that has in the
base a figure like one point zero zero
zero zero one to the power of n for some
algorithms you might have one point one
or one point two but even then it's a
fairly rapidly growing function so it's
also okay to call exponential running
time algorithms unacceptable in general</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
