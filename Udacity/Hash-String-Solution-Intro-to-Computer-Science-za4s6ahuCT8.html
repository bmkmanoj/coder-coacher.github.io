determine which of the following
statements are true let's go through
this statements one by one the first
statement says the number of string
comparisons done to look at the keyword
that is not a key in the hash table may
be less than the number needed to look
up the keyword that is a key in the hash
table as this turns out this is actually
true statement in order to show it we
need an example so let me give you an
example dictionary with three buckets
and Street key words in here I'm not
showing the values because they don't
really matter for this example it could
be the case that if we search for Batman
our hash function takes us the bucket
zero and then we have to compare between
an D is and finally Batman so that would
be three string comparisons let's say we
search for urban and that brings us to
bucket two and there's nothing in bucket
- so there's no comparisons being made
this is an example where it actually
takes more comparisons to look up
something in the hash table then it does
to look at something not in the hash
table statement two says we should
expect the time to look up most keywords
in the hash table will decrease as we
increase the number of buckets and with
a good hash function this is true let's
say we have a hash table with only two
buckets if we have a good hash function
the number of keywords in each bucket
bucket is the same and so the average
number of comparisons is going to be
half the size of a bucket in order to
look up a keyword in the hash table if
we double the number of buckets
the average lookup time is decreased in
significantly and with a good hash
function the time is going to decrease
even more statement three says it is
always better to have more buckets in a
hash table this is a pretty strong
statement as indicated by the use of the
word always and it's really because of
that word the statements false and
there's really two good reasons the
first reason is because changing the
number of buckets be it more or less
changes where keywords hash - it could
be the case that with two buckets I have
a good distribution but if I add a third
bucket the hash function is such that
everything lands in that new bucket we
choose hash functions carefully so that
this is less likely but depending on the
keywords you're using this is still
possible and the second reason is memory
I could have an arbitrarily long hash
table but they can use a lot of space
especially if there are a few key words
that go into it real world
implementations of hash tables try to
suit shoot for a ratio between the
number of buckets they have in the
number of keywords increasing the number
of buckets accordingly as the number of
keywords in the hash table decrease and
increase statement four says the time to
look up a keyword in the hash table is
always less than the time it would take
in a linear time list as used in uniform
so the question is is the lookup time
always less than that lists then we've
that we've been using previously and as
you might suspect the statement is false
and we're going to show that by giving
an example hash table so if I have a
hash table where three keywords I'll go
in bucket one if I want to look up the
keyword Batman I want to go to bucket
one and iterate through each item in
this bucket until I find Batman that's
essentially the same as a normal list
where we just start from the beginning
without doing any kind of hash function
and just go through each item one by one
searching for Batman</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
