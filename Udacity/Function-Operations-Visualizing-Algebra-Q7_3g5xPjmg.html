got even half of these right now some of
these might have been tricky like the
second one or even this last one let's
walk through each of these to see how
they're done to find F plus G of 1 we
need to add the outputs of f of 1 and G
of 1 together to find f of 1 we take X
and set it equal to 1 for this function
so if we plug in a 1 here and here and
for X then we'll get an output of
positive 1 next we need to find G of 1
to find G of 1 we let X equal one for
this function so we'll have 3 times 1
minus 5 which equals negative 2 we have
F of 1 equal to 1 and G of 1 equal to
negative 2 so we just add these two
outputs together to get a final output
of negative 1 to find the second one F
minus G of 1 we'll take the output from
G of 1 negative 2 and we'll subtract
that from the output F of 1 which equals
1 so notice i'll have one here minus
negative 2 when we subtract a negative
we really add so we'll have 1 plus 2
which equals positive 3 this is our
output for F minus G of 1 4 F times G of
1 will simply multiply these two outputs
together so 1 times negative 2 equals
negative 2 now to find F divided by G of
2 we want to find f of 2 and divide it
by G of 2 to find f of 2 we plug in 2
and 4 X this will give us an output of 2
2 squared equals 4 minus 4 is 0 plus two
is two and four G of 2 will let the
input X equal positive 2 which means
we'll get an output a positive one we'll
have 6 minus 5 which equals 1 now we're
ready to do our division this is f of 2
and this is G of 2 we have 2/1 which
equals 2 and finally to find F plus
G of X will simply add these two
functions together so combining the like
terms of x will get 1x and combining our
constant terms we'll have negative 3 so
the overall function is x squared plus X
minus 3 F plus G of X</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
