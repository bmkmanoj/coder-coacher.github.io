so we're taking a single string as an
input I'll call it s and we're first
going to test the base case so the base
case was to see if the string is empty
we should return true right away so we
can do that with an if we're going to
check if s is equal to the empty string
and if it is we return true that's our
base case for the else we have the
recursive case so now we need to do the
test of the first and the last
characters to see if they match and we
can do that using the string indexing
operators as 0 gets us the first
character s negative 1 gets us the last
character if they match then we need to
check the rest of the string if they
didn't match and let's finish the didn't
match case first so if they didn't match
then we know it's not a palindrome
because we found a place where the first
in the last character did not match so
we should return false right away if
they did match well then we have the
harder problem we need to do the
recursive call to check all the other
letters in the string still for map out
palindrome alright so this was our
starting string had all these characters
in it we checked that this one matches
this one so now what we need to do is
take the rest of the string and check if
this is a palindrome so that'll be our
recursive call so we're going to return
the result of calling is palindrome but
instead of passing an S what we want to
do is pass in the string starting from
position 1 of s so removing the first
character and ending at position
negative 1 removing the last character
and remember with our indexing the last
value here is not included so by having
the last index as negative 1 that
removes the final letter of the string
so the first thing to test is the base
case so we'll pass in the empty string
and the empty string is a palindrome so
it should give us the result true which
it does let's try the single letter
string a that's also a palindrome it
reads the same backwards and forwards
and so we also get the value true if we
try say the string a B which is not a
palindrome
we get false and as a longer test if we
try level we should get true which we do
and let's try one of the most famous
palindromes a man a plan a Canal Panama
and we should get true which we do</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
