HTML interpreter to handle these new
JavaScript elements just like we saw a
few seconds ago just like we saw in the
last example typically the parse tree
for HTML will be a list of elements so
we'll just want to process each one in
turn how we process it depends on its
type is it a word a tag JavaScript one
of the easiest cases for us is if it's a
word element we just call our graphics
library and add that word to the final
web page we've already seen what to do
with tag elements in a previous quiz so
let's just do JavaScript now we can get
the text of the embedded JavaScript
fragment out of the abstract syntax tree
that's gonna be something like document
right 55 could be more complicated
calling Fibonacci functions doing
arbitrary computation in fact here J S
stands for JavaScript and this is the
text of the program this next bit is a
bit arbitrary I'm gonna walk through all
the steps but you should not worry about
having to guess these these come out of
nowhere or come from library integration
let's say that we've written down our
JavaScript token definitions in some
other file called Jas tokens I'm going
to need to build a lexer to break this
string down into tokens similarly let's
say I've put all of my javascript
grammar rules somewhere else I'm not
showing them right here but they're
saved somewhere else on the disk in a
file called Jas grammar once I break
this text down into tokens I'm going to
need to check and see if it's valid
JavaScript and build a parse tree Lex is
the name of our library module for doing
lexing yak is the name for our library
module for doing parsing yak does not
sound like it should be doing parsing
stands for yet another compiler compiler
a tool for making compilers or
interpreters in fact just like the
JavaScript interpreter that we're making
now for now this name is just a
historical accident here's the real
exciting part I'm gonna call our
JavaScript parser and ask it to parse
the text from the embedded JavaScript
fragment using the lexer the token
definitions from Jas lexer so Jas tree
now holds a parse tree for JavaScript
and now the quiz for you is just a fill
in these two blanks I have this parse
tree for JavaScript and now I want to do
something I want to call our JavaScript
interpreter and ask it to interpret
something you tell me and then
eventually I want to call the graphics
library and draw some word in the
webpage which word should it be let's
fill in the blanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
