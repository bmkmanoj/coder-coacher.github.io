something like this you know I left out
the other attributes no big deal our
variable month gets substituted into the
string so if Monty goes November
you know the string November renders and
we get it we get a textbox that looks
like this which is what we'd expect but
if month equals the string flew with a
quote in it and an angle bracket and
some more text the string render ends up
looking something like this where we
substitute this variable into here
because the variable the value for a
month is actually this whole string
including the quote and the angle
bracket which screwed up our HTML so our
browser saw this and it sees an input
and says value equals foo and then it
sees a closing quote and a closing angle
bracket and it gets this other string
derp and it just prints that so that's
obviously not the behavior we want the
rendered HTML ends up looking you know
or in the browser ends up looking
something like this you got a text box
with a word foo in it and then it's just
a tank you know quote and an angle
bracket the string derp just hanging out
there and you know that's that's that's
not what we intended and what's really
scary is this allows somebody who knows
how our website works to you know not
just enter random text but what if they
what if they put HTML on our input what
if instead of you know derp it was
something you know salt something better
you know let's let's look at that in our
browser so we're going to enter our bad
data again and this time we're going to
put HTML in there
okay so this time I've put in a quote an
angle bracket to close our input tag and
then I've put some HTML you know a line
break in some bold text and let's see
what happens now oh man we completely
broke our form you know now we're
printing the bold text oh no and we add
a line break and this allows a user to
completely manipulate what our document
looks like so that is not something we
want to allow let's talk about how to
fix this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
