with the normal distribution let's
discuss one of the most common
parametric tests that we might use to
compare two sets of data such as our
samples of left-handed and right-handed
MLB batters that would be the t-test the
t-test like many statistical tests aims
at accepting or rejecting a null
hypothesis a null hypothesis is
generally a statement that we're trying
to disprove by running our tests for
example at two samples came from the
same population this might mean that
left-handed and right-handed batters
show no real difference in their batting
average or that a certain sample is
drawn from a particular probability
distribution for example if we had a
sample of 20 heights and weights of
arbitrary baseball players we might want
to test how likely it is that those 20
people are drawn from the known MLB
player population a hypothesis test such
as the t-test is usually specified in
terms of a test statistic the test
statistic reduces your data set to one
number that helps to accept or reject
the null hypothesis when performing a
t-test we compute a test statistic
called T depending on the value of the
test statistic T we can determine
whether or not our null hypothesis is
true in the case of a one sample t-test
our null hypothesis would be that the
population mean mu is equal to our
sample mean mu not in the two sample
case which we'll be more concerned about
for the purposes of our example the null
hypothesis would be that our two
population means mu naught and mu 1 are
equal</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
