in sight we've got our render tree
can we put pixels on the screen now or
definitely very close but there's one
more step we still need to figure out
where and how all the elements are
positioned on the page that's the layout
step let's take a look the show layout
in action I've come up with a simple
render tree here's what the final result
will look like note that if we rotate
the phone the dimensions of the box is
change but their proportions stayed the
same let's see if we can figure out what
the browser is doing here let's start at
the top we set the background on the
body element to gray that makes sense
that's exactly what we saw and we set
its width 200 percent weight that's a
hundred percent of what exactly it's 100
percent of the layout viewport size if
you paid attention our hello world
examples contained an extra meta tag oh
yeah
I was reading the web fundamentals guide
on responsive design and it said that I
should always have this checked but I
never really understood what it was for
it is a bit cryptic but let's try to
make sense of it what it's doing is
telling the browser that the width of
the layout viewport should be equal to
the device width so let's say the device
width is 320 pixels then if this meta
viewport tag is present the browser will
set the layout viewport to 320 pixels
and that will be our 100% I see but what
happens if I don't provide this tag then
the browser will use the default
viewport width which is typically 980
pixels and it's optimized for large
screens you know how sometimes sites
render zoomed out and you have to zoom
to navigate and read the text that's
because they're not setting the layout
viewport now that makes sense I am
definitely not a big fan of those sites
neither am i to build great mobile
experience you should always set the
matter viewport but getting back to our
example if the device width is 320
pixels then the body will be 320 pixels
wide next we have the div node at 50% of
the width and it is a child of body so
its width is relative to its parent and
50% of 320 pixels is 160 pixels and for
paragraph the width is 50
percent of its parent giving us the
width of 80 pixels and with that we're
done
that's layout now how about you give it
a try</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
