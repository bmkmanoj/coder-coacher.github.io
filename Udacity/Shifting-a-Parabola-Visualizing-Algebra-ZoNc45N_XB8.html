around on the coordinate plane let's
take a look at our original equation y
equals x squared if we add one to the
equation we can see that the entire
graph shifts up one unit notice before
that the vertex was at zero zero and now
our vertex is at 0 comma 1 by adding one
right here to the end of our equation we
really increase all the Y values from
before by one this is why the entire
graph the orange graph shifts one unit
up so a point that was at negative 11 is
now at negative 12 and a point that say
was at to calm before is now at 2 comma
5 notice how the Y value increased by
one we can also make this graph go up
two units three units four units or even
eight units so we can see that adding a
constant term to the end of our parabola
will shift it up so if we subtract a
number it will shift it down the
parabola y equals x squared minus three
is our original parabola only it's been
shifted down three units and again
notice that the orange parabola had a
vertex of 0 0 and this new parabola has
a vertex of 0 negative 3 we could even
change this to be a negative 5 so that
way the orange parabola would shift down
5 units and again notice that the vertex
of this last parabola is 0 negative 5 we
can see that the y coordinate of the
vertex comes from here this negative 5
is right here on our vertex the x
coordinate of our vertex is 0 and it
turns out it comes from solving this
binomial or setting this binomial equal
to 0 x minus 0 is still X so we know
that this term is really still x squared
and if i graph this equation I can see
that they're exactly the same I'm just
writing this in a different form so now
we can quickly see where this vertex
comes from in our equation the 0 is here
and the negative 5
is here now we've seen shifting a
parabola up and down well we can also
see a parabola shifted left and right so
we know by adding three on the end we
could shift the parabola up three units
to shift the graft left or right we're
going to change this binomial if i
subtract one from X it really moves the
graph one unit to the right now the
vertex is here notice that the sign of
the exponent of the vertex is opposite
from the one in here for a whiles
parabola we can set this binomial equal
to zero to find the x-coordinate of the
vertex so in this case X would equal one
the y-coordinate of the vertex is simply
found by the number that's added or
subtracted at the end of the equation</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
