I'll call it friends - for now now in
the constructor I need to initialize
friends - and there's that error I
needed to import it so far so good
now I'll fix add friend I'll add the
friend to both of the lists that I'm
keeping track of right now I tried to
add the whole friend instead of just the
name much better let's see if the tests
are still passing person tester looks
like things are matching so I'll go to
get friends instead of using friends I
want to use friends too but friends - is
an ArrayList so I need to get a string
representation of it but two string
returns brackets around what I want so
I'll need to remove the brackets using
substring I'll put it in a variable and
now I'll return substring starting with
the second character and stopping before
the last character let's see if the
tests still pass looks like everything
is still matching except that there's a
trailing comma right here but that's the
get friend method so I'll come back to
that and now for the especially
satisfying one I'll get to delete all of
this code and replace it with one line
I'll get the element of the array list
at friend index and now everything is
actually matching what we wanted it to
but I need to clean up my extra unused
variables I still have this private
string friends and I'm not using it
anywhere or at least I shouldn't be so
I'll delete it there and here and here
and I think that's all of it but now
friends too has a sort of silly name so
I just want to change friends too to be
friends so I'll use find replace and
replace all of the occurrences creating
an extra variable might have looked like
extra work and if you didn't do all of
that that's fine I did it to show you
how you might approach a much larger
refactoring sometimes when you're
working on a very big refactoring it's
good to make sure that everything still
works at each intermediate stage you'll
learn more about that if you take a job
as a software engineer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
