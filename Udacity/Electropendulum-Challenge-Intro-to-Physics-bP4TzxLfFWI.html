took us quite a bit of effort to figure
out what the period of a pendulum is and
we don't really want to have to repeat
all that same work here with the
electric field so let's see if there are
any tricks we can do here to make this
problem look more like the problem we've
already solved so we don't have to redo
all of the work we've already done so in
the last student we found that the
period of a pendulum is equal to 2 pi
times the square root of the length of
the pendulum over G and this seems all
well and good except we don't know what
G is here now it's tempting here to say
well this is gravitational field
strength so because we're dealing with
an electric field we should just replace
this with the electric field strength
but this turns out to be a wrong
assumption and let's see why so in the
case with gravity we got that the force
was equal to negative mg and we had the
fortunate coincidence that this M here
cancelled out with the M &amp;amp; F equals MA
which just left the G in this case
however we have that force is equal to
the negative of the electric field
strength times the charge Q and there's
no mass here so the mass isn't going to
cancel with that M in F equals MA
fortunately we're not out of tricks just
yet though so the fact that i don't have
an M here poses somewhat of a problem
but it turns out I can just make an M
appear out of nowhere if i multiply this
term by M and also divide it by M I
haven't actually done anything to change
this side of the equation because I've
just multiplied it by one but now you'll
notice that I have an M to cancel which
would just leave eq over m so to make
that idea a little bit less confusing I
can actually call this entire part of
this side GE for the electric version of
G and then my equation will look just
like the equation F equals minus mg
except the G is slightly different but
because this equation has the exact same
form as this equation both of these
equations must have the exact same
solution this means that we can go to
our period equation here and just
replace G here with GE and we know that
this will be the period of this pendulum
so plugging in our value for GE here we
get that the period is equal to 2 pi
times the square root of the mass of the
Bob times the length of the pendulum
over the electric field strength times
the charge Q and plugging in all my
values for all of these variables I get
that the period of the pendulum swing is
2.1 two seconds great job</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
