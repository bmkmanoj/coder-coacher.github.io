has a nonzero probability but they don't
all have the same probability and let's
see how I discovered that so I wrote
some test code that generated this
output and what I did is I gave it some
example input some example decks that
were very simple first I gave it the
deck consisting of three items a B and C
and then I gave it the deck consisting
of two items a and B and I had a test
for both shuffle algorithms the correct
algorithm and the teachers algorithm I
had to generate a few thousand decks
shuffle them and then figure out how
many times each of the possible outcomes
come out now for three cards there's six
possible permutations both shuffle
algorithms generated all six and for the
correct shuffle algorithm you can see
that they're all about one-sixth of the
time 16 to the time would be sixteen
point six six six seven percent and
they're all pretty close to that for the
teacher shuffle algorithm not so much
notice that the combination ABC only
shows up five percent of the time
whereas some of the other combinations
show up twenty-seven percent of the time
not very good distribution and
probability at all so there's something
wrong with that algorithm that's even
more obvious when we just give it the
trivial case of a2 card deck with the
correct algorithm turns out to be
exactly 50 50 it might have been 49.1
50.1 this was just luck that it was
exactly 50 50 in my simulation but with
the teachers algorithm way off one-sixth
of the time you get a B and 56 the times
you get ba</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
