getting your own personal genetic
information and done any searching
online then you've probably come across
a company called 23andme and in this
lesson we're fortunate enough to have a
co-instructor a representative from
23andme join us joanna mountain thank
you Matt I'm excited to be here it's
great to have you know can you tell us a
little bit more about 23 million and
what you do there as a geneticist at
23andme I'm involved in the research
where we try to link the DNA with
particular traits and diseases we also
I've been involved in developing the
tools and the features that help people
understand their health and their
ancestry through their DNA now when was
23 me actually started or founded
company was founded in 2006 and we
launched the service in 2007 the year I
joined and that was the first time it
was possible for people to really
explore this hidden dimension of
themselves something that was was hidden
from everybody and it was a brand new
opportunity for people to learn about
themselves through looking at their DNA
now this sounds like a pretty exciting
revelation for most people is this
something that's available and
accessible to everyone anybody who has
internet access I can sign up an x30
exploring their DNA and the cool thing
is I remember the first time I went
snorkeling and I it was just
mind-blowing to me feel to you know
discover a whole new world but within
the ocean and as to me DNA being able to
explore your DNA is similar you just it
opens up a whole new world of things to
learn and it's it's a very personal
world it's you and that's this is
something that was not available ten
years ago well i think i know just the
group of people who might be interested
in learning a little bit more about
their genetics so let's go chat with
them great let's go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
