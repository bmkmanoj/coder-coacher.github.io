for showing the intractability of the
problems that Alice Bob and Carol are
working on seems to be rather hard we're
first going to start with gathering
evidence that their problems might be
intractable of course we don't yet
really know if that problems really are
intractable because as we have just seen
there are also arguments why their
problems could actually be tractable
because just having an exponential
number of solutions does not necessarily
mean that their problems are difficult
but we're going to see how it turns out
so how can we gather evidence that the
problems of Alice Bob and Carol could be
intractable one way could be what we
have done in the last unit and that is
if you recall in the last unit we showed
that all of these three problems are
either tractable or intractable so one
way to gather evidence that they are
intractable is to find more and more
problems for which we also don't know
polynomial time algorithms and connect
them to the problems that we know so
once if we had this huge network of
problems where we say if we find a
polynomial time algorithm for just one
of them all of them would be solvable in
polynomial time but nobody has yet found
such an algorithm that would already be
rather strong evidence that also clique
vertex cover and independent set might
be hard so we might for example end up
with thousands of highly relevant
problems for which no one has so far
found a polynomial time algorithm and if
they're all connected that would be not
a mathematical proof but it would be a
somewhat convincing body of evidence for
these problems hardness and in fact I
will introduce you to such a collection
of problems at the end of this unit and
we'll also have a closer look in the
next units but today actually we're
going to do something that is a little
bolder we're still not going to be able
to achieve a mathematical proof of
intractability
but we're going to do something that I
would say is somewhere in between
gathering evidence and a mathematical
proof and the way we're going to do this
is as follows I'm going to introduce to
you a type of computer that is extremely
powerful so powerful in fact that no one
has ever conceived if it could actually
be built and then what I'll show you is
that if there was a polynomial time
algorithm for vertex cover or clique or
independent set that would be like
having a blueprint for this
super-powerful computer we won't be able
to show that it's impossible to build
such a computer but it is pretty good
evidence that those three problems up
here are very tough problems to solve so
what makes this computer that I'm about
to introduce to you so powerful well
roughly speaking it's so powerful
because it has the capability to guess
things for us and it will guess them
correctly but you're going to see in a
minute what I mean by that first of all
let's have a look once more at the three
problems clique vertex cover and
independent set and have a look at how a
machine that would be capable of
guessing things for us could potentially
make the solution to these problems very
easy and we're going to do this as a
quiz and what I would like you to think
about is what the three problems we have
been talking about so far have in common
and I'm going to give you a number of
choices and I would like you to tell me
which ones of these you think are true
there can be more than one so there's
four possible choices here and again
more than one of these can be true so
what do all of these three problems up
here have in common choice number one we
have not found a polynomial time
algorithm for them yet choice number two
they are not practically relevant choice
number three the simple algorithms that
we have found so far go through an
exponential number of solutions and
finally for those simple algorithms for
any given 0 and 1 assignment with the
vertices so we have already assigned the
values of 0 and 1 to them it is
relatively easy to figure out if that
assignment is a valid solution and if it
is a valid solution how large that
solution is so please check all of these
that are correct</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
