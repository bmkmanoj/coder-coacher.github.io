notebook your code should look something
like this you could also use the
original data set by uncommon ting the
commented lines here now run this piece
of code we can again use the described
function to look at a summary of the
data once that finishes running you will
get a table that looks very similar to
the one we got for Illinois we can then
look at the first 10 lines of the f
underscore California data frame running
that code then gives you this table when
you scroll down you will see the ten
rows we wanted printed and 28 columns so
now we have a new data frame for
California throughout this lesson we'll
show examples with the state of Illinois
data set at some points in quizzes will
ask you to use the California data set
and repeat what we have just shown we're
going to explore the Medicare data set
somewhat further remember we wanted to
see how we can find anomalies in the
data although we wanted to find outliers
the exercise here is not necessarily to
find fraud or outliers note the exercise
here is not necessarily to find outliers
or fraud in the Medicare data but to
walk through the ways we can go about
finding anomalies in data in general so
the next important question we are going
to ask is what are the variables of
interest in the data set let's switch
back to the ipython notebook to
investigate this we had seen from the
summary of the data set that we had 28
different columns of data we had seen
from the summary of the data set that we
had 28 different columns in it let's try
to print the names of the columns to do
so simply execute this line of code the
list of
columns is long if you scroll to the
bottom of it you will see six variables
that may be of interest to us one of
them is called average Medicare allow
amount the other is average submitted
charge amount and another is average
Medicare payment allow the six variables
that may be interesting are the average
and standard deviation of the Medicare
allowed amount the submitted charge
amount and the Medicare payment amount
these are the variables that have
directly some indication of charges
we're going to investigate these
variables further some of the other
columns are very specific to Medicare
and could be useful if we did some more
research on Medicare and the data
however without doing some domain
specific research we can still see that
these variables could be of interest in
detecting unusual charges to keep things
simple we are only going to use the
average Medicare amount we can use the
standard deviation of the Medicare
allowed amount and the submitted charge
amounts and the payments amount as
inherent irreducible variance in the
average charges after looking at the
variables of interest in the data set we
came to the conclusions that the allowed
amount the charged amount and the
payment amounts might be of interest for
our investigation</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
