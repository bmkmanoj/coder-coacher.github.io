basics of linear programming by
examining it in just two dimensions then
we built up some vocabulary and notation
that allows us to extend these notions
to n dimensions now we're ready for the
culmination of all this work in the
fundamental theorem of linear
programming which captures the idea that
optimal solutions should be at the
corners also called extreme points of
the feasible region and it tells us that
we need only consider basic feasible
solutions precisely the theorem states
that given a linear program in this
standard form where a is an M by n
matrix of rank M then if there's a
feasible solution there is a basic
feasible solution and if there is an
optimal feasible solution there is an
optimal basic feasible solution we'll
start by proving the first point Let X
be a feasible solution and we'll
consider only the positive entries
without loss of generality let's assume
that those are the first P then it must
be the case that this linear combination
of the columns a 1 through ap is equal
to B that is after all part of what it
means to be feasible there are two cases
first suppose that the columns a1
through ap are linearly independent then
it's not possible that P should be
greater than M recall that these vectors
are only M elements long if P is equal
to M well then X is basic already and
we're done P could be less than M that
would mean that X is degenerate but then
we can just add columns to form a
linearly independent basis and we would
be alright
so that then covers the case where these
columns are linearly independent next
suppose that those columns are linearly
dependent well that means there are
coefficients y 1 through YP such that
this linear combination of the columns
is equal to 0 with at least one of the
coefficients y i+ then we're going to
choose this parameter Epsilon in a very
clever way so that it's the minimum
of these ratios XII weii among all these
eyes such that y is positive then
multiply in this equation by this
epsilon and subtracting it from this one
we end up with this equation here these
coefficients must represent another
feasible solution but by a choice of
epsilon we've set at least one of these
coefficients to 0 while the others have
remained positive so we've reduced the
number of positive entries in X and we
can repeat this over and over until case
one is reached where a1 through a P are
linearly independent now on to part two
of the theorem this will feel similar to
the first part we want to show that if
there's an optimal feasible solution
there's an optimal basic feasible
solution we let X be an optimal feasible
solution with nonzero entries X 1
through X P well it's feasible so this
linear combination of the columns of a
then must be equal to B and because it's
optimal its objective value C transpose
X must be the maximum over all possible
feasible X again we first consider the
case where the columns a 1 through a P
are linearly independent and the
situation is the same as before
P being greater than M is impossible
equal means that it's a basic solution
and less just means that it's a
degenerate solution this case is simple
if these columns are linearly dependent
then there exists a set of coefficients
y1 through YP such that the linear
combination of the columns is equal to 0
with at least one of the Y's being
positive note however for epsilon
sufficiently close to zero in both the
positive and the negative Direction X
minus epsilon Y is still feasible
multiplied Absalon times this equation
and add it to this equation and we end
up still with a set of coefficients
equal to B thus C transpose Y has to be
equal to 0
if it weren't then C transpose X would
be strictly less than C transpose times
X minus epsilon Y we can choose the
right sign on epsilon so that this
inequality holds but this is impossible
because X is optimal we conclude that C
transpose Y is equal to zero and then we
can choose epsilon to be the same thing
we chose it before it'll still give us
an optimal feasible solution only this
will time that we'll have smaller
support because we're able to choose it
to set one of the coefficients of this
vector here to zero that wasn't a zero
before and we can repeat playing this
game over and over until we reach the
case where a 1 through AP are linearly
independent we've just seen how the
fundamental theorem of linear
programming tells us that we can always
achieve an optimal value for the program
with a basic solution
moreover basic solutions come from the
choice of M linearly independent columns
for the basis remember this key point
