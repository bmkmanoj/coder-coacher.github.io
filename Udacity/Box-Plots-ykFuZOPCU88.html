code that looks very similar to the code
from before we want to create a box plot
to compare the distribution of the
number of friendships initiated for our
male and female users so let's just
remind ourselves what variables we have
in our data frame so for friend request
I think I'll use friendships initiated
that sounds right to make my box plot
I'll pass X the variable gender since
that's my categorical variable and then
I'll pass why friendships initiated now
I need a subset my data frame just like
from before and then I'll need to tell q
plot that I want a box plot so i'll set
the Geo looking at this plot we see that
most users made less than 500 friend
requests so let's set our while amusing
0 as our minimum and 500 as our max so
I'll add the cord Cartesian layer and
set my limits it's really close but it
looks like females have slightly more
friend requests since the meeting black
line is slightly higher for females than
this medium black line for males now
this might be too close to call so I'd
say we should zoom in again this time
will change the upper limit to 150 yeah
it looks like females initiate slightly
more friendships on average let's also
check this with a numerical summary I
can use the by command and split
friendships initiated by gender and then
find their summary so I'll take my
friendships initiated split it by gender
and then run a summary and here's our
output and we can see that the median
for females is 49 whereas the meeting
for males is 44 now you might be
wondering why should we even create this
box plot to begin with if we can answer
our question with a numerical summary
well it's helpful to understand the
distribution of the data so in the case
of the box plot we can see the middle
fifty percent of values for each segment
of our categorical variable our box
plots also let us get a sense of
outliers so in one way they're much more
rich with information than just this
