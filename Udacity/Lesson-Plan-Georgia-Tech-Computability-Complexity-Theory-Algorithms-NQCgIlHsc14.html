this lesson is a familiarity with the
basics of graphs and graphed reversals
you should know what a graph is and the
difference between directed and
undirected graphs you should be familiar
with the common vocabulary surrounding
graphs such as vertex degree the ideas
of neighbors and neighborhoods and paths
in graphs and we will also assume that
you are familiar with the basic graph
traversal algorithms like depth-first
search and breadth-first search and
their running times the plan for the
lesson is this we begin by introducing
the necessary definitions for a flow
Network flow capacities and residual
networks and residual capacities then we
present the ford-fulkerson method and
show that it finds a maximum flow with
the help of a theorem that shows that
the maximum flow non-network is actually
equal to the minimum cut finally we
discussed two variations on the
ford-fulkerson method showing that these
algorithms make it much more efficient
than a naive version would be this
lecture will follow most closely the
treatment in Kleinberg and tar doshas
algorithm design but any reference on
the subject should suffice</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
