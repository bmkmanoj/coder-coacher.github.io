are a lot of data coming out of
healthcare US health care is incredibly
expensive overall spending is three
point eight trillion dollars in US per
year that's more than the value of ten
biggest companies plus ten Beijing
Olympics plus a Warren Buffett and Bill
Gates but does it have to be that way
there's massive waste in health care
unfortunately the estimated waste in US
health care alone is seven hundred sixty
five billion dollars that's equivalent
to the NASA's total budget for the past
fifty years not only the cause is an
issue but also the quality of health
care is poor there are two hundred to
four hundred thousand preventable deaths
per year in the US there's a thousand
people per day for preventable deaths
occurred during this video if we
classify the preventable deaths against
other causes of deaths it will be the
number three causes of deaths in the
United States after only heart disease
and cancer so there are massive problems
presented in modern health care
including high cost high waste and
locality how can big data help the
hopeless big data can lead to better
care and lower cost</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
