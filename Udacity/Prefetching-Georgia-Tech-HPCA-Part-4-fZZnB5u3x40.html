idea to what we did when we increase the
block size to reduce the number of
misses is called prefetching the wave
prefetching works is that we guess which
blocks will be accessed soon in the
future before they're actually accessed
and then we bring those blocks into the
cache ahead of time before they actually
will be accessed so with no prefetching
if time goes to the right we might have
an access here let's say load word a and
then we check quickly whether it's in
our cache and if it is not we will go to
memory and spend a lot of time waiting
for it until it comes back so here we
can supply the data to the processor so
this is what happens with no prefetching
with prefetching assuming that the load
would happen here
sometime before the load we have to
guess that a will be accessed and
request it from memory now what was
memory latency here will be here and at
this point the block is in the cache so
when we try to load it we have a hit so
as you can see with prefetching we are
guessing what will be accessed and start
fetching it from memory into the cache
if we guess correctly instead of a mess
we get a hit if we get incorrectly we
brought something into the cache that
replaced something that might have been
useful so it prefetching we have that
good guesses will eliminate misses but
bad guesses lead to what is called cache
pollution because we are bringing stuff
that is useless into the cache if it
doesn't get access that means that maybe
it would never have been brought into
the cache in the first place and because
of cache pollution because we kick out
something that might have been useful
with useless data not only that we
didn't eliminate the miss here because
we guessed wrongly we also might have
created another miss because we kicked
out something that later might be
accessed and that we don't like
so overall prefetching is about trying
to make good guesses so that we
eliminate misses while trying to
eliminate that guesses because we don't
want to create additional mess
