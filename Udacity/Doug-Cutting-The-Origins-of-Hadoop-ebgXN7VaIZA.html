about 10 years ago in around 2003 I was
working on an open-source web search
engine called nudge and we knew it
needed to be something very scalable
because the web was you know billions of
pages terabytes petabytes of data that
we needed to be able to process and we
said about you know doing the best job
we could and it was tough we got things
up and running on four or five machines
not very well and around that time
Google published some papers about how
they were doing things internally
published a paper about their
distributed file system GFS and about
their processing framework MapReduce so
my partner and I at the time in this
project mike kafir ella said about
trying to re-implement these in open
source so that more people could use
them than just folks at Google took us a
couple years and we had nuts up and
running on instead of four or five
machines on 20 to 40 machines it wasn't
perfect it was it wasn't it wasn't
totally reliable but it worked
and we realized that to get it to the
point where it would scale to thousands
of machines and be as bulletproof as it
needed to be would take more than just
the two of us working part time around
that time Yahoo approached me and said
they were interested in investing in
this so I went to work for Yahoo in
January of 2006 first thing I did there
was we took the parts of nuts that were
a distributed computing platform and put
him into a separate project a new
project christened Hadoop over the next
couple of years with Yahoo's help and
the help of others we took Hadoop and
really got it to the point where it did
scale to petabytes and running on
thousands of processors and doing so
quite reliably it spread to lots of
companies
and mostly in the internet sector and
became quite a success after that we
started to see a bunch of other projects
grow up around it and had oops grown to
be the kernel of a what's pretty much an
operating system for big data we've got
we've got tools that allow you to more
easily do MapReduce programming so you
can develop using SQL or a data flow
language called Pig and we've also got
the beginnings of higher-level tools
we've got an interactive SQL with Impala
we've got search and so we're really
seeing this develop to being a general
purpose platform for data processing
that scales much better and that is much
more flexible than anything
that's that's else that's out there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
