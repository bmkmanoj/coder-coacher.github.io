we're done Michael we're done with the
entire lesson we don't have to do
anything else anymore we know that we're
supposed to look over a subset of data
pickup rules and then combine them so
what else do you need to know in order
to write your first ensemble learning
algorithm so I'm already kind of
uncomfortable with this notion of
combined right so like I can think of
lots of really dumb ways to combine
things like choose one at random or you
know I don't know add them all up and
divide by PI I mean so so presumably
there's got to be some intelligence and
how this combination is taking place yes
you would think so but you're not you're
not at all bothered about how you pick a
subset oh I was imagining you meant
random subsets oh so you'd already made
an assumption about how we were gonna
pick a subset you just want your
everything final well actually let's
explore that for a minute here's kind of
the dumbest thing you can imagine doing
that turns out to work out pretty well
we're gonna pick subsets by I'm gonna
say uniformly just to be specific about
it so we're gonna do the dumbest thing
that we could think of or one of the
dumbest things you could think of or
maybe we should say simplest and not
dumbest so it's not to make a value
judgment that you could think of doing
which would be there just uniformly
randomly choose among some of the data
and say that's the data that I'm gonna
look at and then I'm gonna apply some
learning algorithm to it that is that
what you're thinking of Michael yeah
okay so just pick a subset of the data
apply a learner to it I'll get some
hypotheses out I'll get some rule out
and now I'm gonna combine them so since
we're being simple why don't we try
doing something simple for combining
let's imagine Michael that we're doing
regression what's kind of the simplest
thing you could do if you have ten
different rules which tell you how you
should be predicting some new data point
what's the simplest thing you could
imagine doing with them so okay so each
of them spits out a number I guess if we
kind of equally believe in each of them
a reasonable thing to do would be to
average right so a very simple way of
combining in the case of regression
would be to average them we'll simply
take the mean and by the way why
wouldn't we equally believe in each of
them each one of them learned over a
random subset of the data you have no
reason to have any one's better than the
other there's a couple reasons one is it
could be a bad random subset I don't
know how I would measure that it could
be a good random
subset yeah then we'd wonder if we'd
want that to count more in the mean but
but I guess I was thinking more in terms
of maybe for some of the subsets you
know it gets more error than others or
it uses a more complex rule than others
or something I could imagine that
actually maybe we can explore how this
sort of idea might go wrong let's let's
do that maybe we have with the quiz you
like quizzes right they're important</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
