change of the number of infectious
persons it was a constant times the
number of infectious persons times the
number of susceptible persons if this is
the number of persons per day that move
from susceptible to infectious the same
number has to get lost from the
susceptible compartment so the rate of
change of the number of susceptible
persons has to be minus the same
quantity and then there's the second
effect namely that people recover we've
already looked at that term this is the
increase of the number of recovered
persons per time if this number of
persons is added to the recovered
compartment each day we have to subtract
it from the infectious compartment as
well we have to subtract it from the
infectious compartment because these
persons leave the infectious compartment
and join the recovered compartment this
completes the equations of the SI R
model obviously this is a very rough
model in particular as the numbers that
we are dealing with here are not integer
numbers in real life there should be say
1,000 or 1001 of 1082 persons but with
these equations we dealing with say 1000
point 1 2 3 4 5 persons these equations
can only make sense for large numbers of
persons so that the fractional part can
be ignored but if these numbers are
large the numerical constants that we
are using here may for instance be used
to model influenza</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
