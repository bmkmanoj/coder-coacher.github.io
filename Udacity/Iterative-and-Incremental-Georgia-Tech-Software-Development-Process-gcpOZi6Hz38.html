distinguishing aspects of the rational
unified process the fact that it is use
case driven and the fact that it is
architecture centric the third and final
distinguished aspect of RUP is that it
is iterative and incremental so let's
see what that means by considering the
lifetime of a software project basically
the lifetime of a rational unified
process consists of a series of cycles
such as the ones done representing here
cycle one cycle two through cycle N and
as you can see these cycles can also be
called increments and each one of these
cycles involves all of the main phases
of software development in addition each
cycle results in a product release which
can be internal or external more
precisely each cycle terminates with the
product release that includes a complete
set of artifacts for the project that
means code manuals use cases
non-functional specification test cases
and so on so I just said that each cycle
involves all of the main phases of
software development specifically each
cycle is further divided in four phases
inception elaboration construction and
transition in a minute we will look at
each one of these phases in detail and
see how they relate to the traditional
activities of software development
before that I want to mention the last
level of these iterations which happens
within these individual phases more
precisely inside each of these phases
there might be multiple iterations so
what are these iterations
well basically each iteration
corresponds to a group of use cases that
are selected so as to deal with the most
important risks first so if you have a
set of use cases that you're considering
which means that you have a set of
features that you need to implement you
will select for each iteration the most
risky ones that you still haven't
realized and realize them in that
iteration and then continuing the
following iterations with less and less
risky ones so basically what happens in
the end is that essentially each
iteration extend functionality beyond
the previous iteration</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
