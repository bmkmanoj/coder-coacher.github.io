an analogical reasoning that are the
subject of current research first the
cause analogical reasoning entails cross
domain transfer does it mean if we
necessarily need a common vocabulary
across all the domains consider the
example of the atomic structure is solar
system once again suppose I were to use
this term revolves to say the electron
revolves around the nucleus but use it
and rotate to say the planet rotates in
an orbit around the Sun i have used two
different terms how then can I do
alignment between these two situations
should I use the same vocabulary if I
don't use the same vocabulary what
alternative is their second analogical
reasoning entails problem of instruction
and transformation so far we have talked
as if the Apollo remains fixed a source
case is retrieved and transfer occurs
but often the agent needs to abstract
and transcribe the problem in order to
be able to retrieve the sausage a third
issue an analogical reasoning concerns
compound and compositional analogies so
far we have talked at given a problem we
can grieve a case and transfer some
knowledge from that case to the problem
but often we retrieve not one case and
we transfer knowledge from not one case
but from several cases if you're
designing a car you may design the
engine biology to one vehicle the chasis
biology to some other vehicle this is an
example of compound analogy but how can
we make companion ology work in
compositional analogy and a logic works
at several levels abstraction supposing
we were to make an analogy between your
business organization and some of the
business organization we might make this
computational analogy first of the level
of people next to the level of processes
third of the level of the organization
as a whole this is an example of
compositional analogy we're mapping at
one level support transfer the next
level how do we do compositional analogy
in AI agents fourth visual spatial
analogies so far we have talked about
analogies in which the transferred
necessarily engages causal knowledge
there are large number of analogies in
which
causalities at most implicit will
consider this visual spatial analogies
later in the class fifth conceptual
combination a powerful learning
mechanism is learning a new concept but
combining parts of familiar concepts
analogical reasoning is one mechanism
for conceptual combination I have a one
concept the problem concept that are the
atomic structure another concept the
solution concept the concept of the
solar system I take some part of the
solar system knowledge combined it with
my concept of the atom to get a new
concept of the atom if you are
interested in any of these issues and
where you to join the ph.d program in
computer science</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
