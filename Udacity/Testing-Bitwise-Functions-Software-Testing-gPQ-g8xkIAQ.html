of bitwise functions and so what we're
going to want to do is write to Python
functions called PI common bits and low
common bits given two inputs a and B
which are integers that are the same
size let's say 32 or 64-bit integers
return an integer with the same bit
width with a high order bits that the
two inputs have in common are included
in the return value the first bit where
the two inputs differ at a bit position
starting from those starting for the
high end is set and all remaining bits
are cleared okay so that's probably
completely unclear just as a list of
requirements so let me do an example so
if a is 1 0 1 0 1 and b is 1 0 0 1 1
then the output is going to be the high
order bits that they have in common so
the one is in common it's set in both
inputs so we return that the 0 is in
common so we copy that to the output
this bit is different the third bit is
different so we want to set that bit and
clear all remaining bits so hopefully
that's clear so we copy bits that are in
common until we find the difference we
set that bit and everything else is
clear now we also want to implement a
function called low common bits that
does the same thing except starting from
the bottom and so if you take the same
example and we do the low common bits
we'd start at the bottom and see that
one is common so we copied it between
the two the next bit the second it from
the bottom is different so we set that
bit and we clear all the rest and so
what you might be saying to yourself at
this point is these functions look
really silly that this looks like a
contrived example that a professor would
come up with just a mess with students
but that's not actually the case these
functions come from an optimized try
implementation what a try is is a kind
of a balanced ordered tree not
incredibly unlike display tree the way
you look that we already looked at and
some of its friends but tries rely on
bitwise operations to find the
descendants of nodes in order to get
really high performance and really low
memory footprints</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
