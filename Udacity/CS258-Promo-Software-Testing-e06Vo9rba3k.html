software fail this June I'll be teaching
CS 258 which is a course on applied
software testing what that means is the
focus of the course is going to be on
trying to make real software fail as
opposed to learning software engineering
theory the reason I wanted to create
this course is because computer science
educators like me often haven't done a
very good job in teaching CS students to
become really strong testers and I'd
like to help try to fix that one of the
things you'll do in this class is
participate in some tournaments that
we've set up where you're gonna try to
break software that other students have
wrote and they're gonna try to break
software that you wrote and I think this
will be really fun I've spent the last
12 years as a computer science
researcher mainly working on ways to
improve the quality of software
including reporting about 450 bugs to
people who develop C compilers this
class is for you if you're interested in
increasing the quality of software that
you write and in increasing the quality
of software that other people write
you're ready for this class if you have
a reasonable working knowledge of
algorithms and data structures and if
you're an intermediate level Python
programmer who could put together the
basic control flow constructs and data
types in order to solve small problems
see you in class</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
