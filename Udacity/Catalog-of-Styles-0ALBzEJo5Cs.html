big long list and I'm not going to go
into all them but I will make some make
some comments that are appropriate to a
few of them the idea for throwing these
at you is that as I said the key to
software design is having experience
experience means being aware of possible
solutions and here's a catalogue of
solutions that have been applied in
certain circumstances in the past in the
kwi see quick exercise that you
undertook you saw the abstract data type
architectural style as did the as you
did the batch sequential one blackboard
architecture is one in which the various
components post their results and the
requests on some kind of common data
repository and the other components look
at the repository and see if there's
anything they can react to the fourth
one here the big ball of mud is not
really an architectural style it's an
absence of one it usually arises because
of the process of architectural erosion
or because the team didn't even have an
architectural design process in the
first place we also already have
mentioned client server will talk about
components component based systems later
in the in the course this use of the
term component is somewhat different
than the one we've been using in this
particular lesson but we'll make that
clear when we get to it you may not have
heard about co routines so I want two
men take it take a second to mention
that with subprograms or subroutines we
mentioned that there's this asymmetric
relationship there's a caller and a
colleague with co routines it's a
symmetric relation ok a can call B &amp;amp; B
can call a ok moreover if a calls be for
second time b continues from the point
that was last at when it returned from
the first call these are called co
routines a primary example of co
routines think about printing out
formatted data with printing out
formatted data such as with printf
typically you have
a list of formatting information and a
list of data items and you the
implementation proceeds by taking a
first formatting information and the
first data item and connecting them
together then getting the second
formatting information and the second
data item and there may be some loops
involved some formatting information may
allow for multiple occurrences moreover
the data provided may be in the form of
a loop so we're really going back and
forth between these two streams of
information and occur with chain is a
perfect perfect style for dealing with
that kind of situation if you've got a
sequel database and you've got some
experience with this you know that you
can include in your standard sequel some
other functions that you've written if
you do that sometimes the architectural
style is called data centric that is
you're using stored database procedures
in this course we won't be getting into
domain modeling very much but there is a
architectural style called domain driven
design and here buy a domain we mean a
kind of application program so think
about for example tax processing
software with tax processing software
there's certain vocabulary that
everybody's familiar with such as
deductions and there are typical ways of
solving problems so if you've ever used
your turbo tax or other tax preparation
software you know if you change
something over here other things will
get changed automatically for you that
style of data flow updates is inherently
part of the tax preparation software
application domain and so by organizing
your tax preparation software using this
particular domain architectural style
once again you can save yourself effort
we're going to be looking more
extensively at implicit invocation and
also in the garland and Shaw book that's
listed on the resources page there's a
very nice section that talks about all
the possible options
for implicit invocation architectural
styles another very popular one is
layered architectures in which each
layer in the system acts as a virtual
machine providing capabilities to the
layers above it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
