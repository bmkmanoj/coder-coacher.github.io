two questions were actually a technique
that's called the door in the face
technique here a person will ask for a
larger request that is most likely a bit
over the top and then when the result is
no they ask for a smaller request here
is an example that I experienced
personally when I was in graduate school
and on a limited budget I received a
phone call from a firefighters
association looking to raise money for
firefighters and their families I was a
big supporter of the firefighters
however the person asked if I could
donate one hundred dollars and I
actually did not have one hundred
dollars available to donate and I told
him sorry that that was too much and
immediately the person said oh well can
you perhaps give fifteen dollars and
right away I said sure I can get $15 and
the idea here again is that this was a
technique called the door in the face
it's actually quite effective asking for
something that is large and maybe not
typical a purse is likely to say no when
you follow up with a more reasonable
request a person typically is more
likely to respond positively can you
think of any personal experiences with
these two techniques that we discussed
perhaps you can share them on the forum</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
