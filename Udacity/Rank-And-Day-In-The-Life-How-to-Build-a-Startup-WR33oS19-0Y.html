your customer segment hypotheses is rank
each job according to what you believe
is its significance to the customer and
you get to guess on day one is it
crucial or trivial and take a guess
about how frequently it occurs and
outline what specific context a job gets
done I call this the day in the life of
a customer that is you ultimately ought
to be able to go up to a whiteboard and
diagram for me or anybody else here's
what a customer does from the moment
they get up to when they go to work or
when they're at school or something else
and here the products they use in the
car they drive and what they read it
cetera and if you really don't have a
deep understanding of that customer and
where your product fits you're really
going to have a hard time understanding
them now just remember on day one all
you're mostly doing is guessing but the
whole objective of getting out of the
building is trying to fill in this day
in the life so you actually when you say
something about here's how we ought to
go advertise to them or reach them or
use get Google AdWords to them that
you're just not saying it's because I
think so it's because you're saying I've
spoken to a ton of these people and
they'd love to buy our stuff but here's
how we reach them or hers the key
message we need to deliver</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
