the first one says we want to have a
fixed number of clusters well actually
the first thing I note about that it
since we gonna have a fixed number of
clusters it doesn't have the richness
property good point because richness
would allow for one cluster or could
have n clusters or could have in over
three clusters or could have been over
two clusters but here you forced it
always have n over two clusters so it
can't represent all possible clusterings
agreed however you'll notice that
there's nothing in here that cares about
distances in the sense that if I took
all of the coins and I multiplied their
distances by two I would still get the
same clusters in exactly the same order
that's the important thing that it cares
about distances but it only cares about
the order not the scale exactly so that
means they're scale invariance very good
and then by the same argument this
algorithm has consistency because the
points that were clustered together if
they got closer together they would
still be picked up and the ones that
were farther apart well they'd still get
picked up by each other and it doesn't
matter so they're definitely consistent
that's right and that's a nice little
property of singling clustering let's
move on to the second clustering
algorithm nice okay so clusters that are
data units apart well since theta can
change even if they just fixed the the
points that I get could be various kinds
of distances so let's imagine that theta
was 10 feet if all the points are within
10 feet of one another then they would
be one cluster yep if on the other hand
all the points were more than 10 feet
apart you would have in different
clusters and you could do any of them in
between so this is rich it is indeed
that's right we can always muck with the
units or muck with data for that matter
so that we can group we can make any
number of clusters in any combination
that we want yeah but for exactly the
same argument that they're rich they are
not scale invariant yeah because I could
just take everything and multiply it by
theta multiplied the distance by theta
and now I will suddenly have in and if I
had in to begin with i could divide by
theta and then I would have one so
there's not scale invariant agreed but
the consistency argument still works
because all the points that got
clustered together because they were
within theta of each other if I made
them closer would still be within theta
of each other and the ones that weren't
closer together because they were more
than theta part would now be even more
than theta apartment so you do get
consistency agreed excellent
okay all right last example clusters
that are theta W units apart where I'm
sorry theta Omega units apart theta
where theta divided babe I think we're
omega equals the the maximum distance
well that's just a way of normalizing
distance in much the same way that I
argued for richness for the second
algorithm the same argument applies here
it is rich it is rich because I can keep
just shrinking and moving the points
around it and it'll work out just fine
so it's definitely rich we don't control
Omega because that's determined by the
distances but we can change the theta so
that things are too close to depart yeah
okay and that's sort of the last thing
you said for the second algorithm to so
you do get richness now what's
interesting to me here is that unlike in
the second algorithm where you didn't
have scale invariance you do get scale
invariance here because if I try to make
things bigger I'm also going to make the
maximum distance bigger by exactly the
same amount and so I will always end up
back where I was before yeah so whatever
you do to scale this it's going to get
undone yeah right exactly anything I do
to make it make them farther apart will
just make them the same distance but at
least by Omega agreed okay and and if we
have consistency to we've got a trifecta
we do except we don't have consistency
what because if I make the the clusters
that are farther apart farther apart I
also change Omega and that could
actually change the cluster it would
because in fact imagine that I made the
points of the set of clusters much
closer together but then I move that
cluster you know sort of infinitely far
apart from the rest of the clusters then
suddenly my theta divided by infinity or
near infinity would make the radius of
allowable cluster so small that no
points would be able to cluster with any
other point and so that would screw up
whatever you had before assuming you had
clusters before at all and so I can
construct the world where consistency
would be wrong oh that's nice it made a
little diagonal of excess and I win
three in a row well done Michael so what
little tweak do we have to do one of
these algorithms in order to give me a
trifecta yeah it would be great wouldn't
it and that's the final algorithm that
will talk about great</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
