we will discuss is the law of
diminishing returns let's say that we
had an original processor which we'll
call Gen one in which our execution time
can roughly be divided into a purple
phase and a blue phase each of them
takes about half the execution time
let's say that in the generation 2
processor we decided to speed up the
blue phase by a factor of 2 what we got
now is that the purple part is not
affected and the blue part is now half
as long the overall speed-up of the Gen
2 processor over Gen 1 is equal to 1
over half is not enhanced half is sped
up by a factor of 2 and we get the
speed-up of 133 which is a sizable
speed-up now let's say that we have a
generation 3 processor where we again
get the blue part and speed it up by a
factor of 2 relative to the gen 2
processors now we have that the purple
part is still the same and the blue part
is half of what it was the speed-up of
the gen 3 processor over a Gentoo
processor is 1 over and now we have to
be careful the unaffected part is now
2/3 of the execution time the affected
part is only 1/3 and that part is still
affected by a factor of 2 so the overall
speed-up
is 1.2 over Gen 2 if we keep improving
the blue part over the generations
eventually we will get 2 almost no
speed-up why because we are improving
what amounts to less and less of the
execution time furthermore usually it is
the case that improving something
initially is not very hard but after you
exhaust the easy methods for improvement
it becomes very very difficult to get
new speed ups on a thing that has been
already enhanced hugely so eventually
the solutions that will improve the
purple part will be cheaper than the
solutions that further improve the blue
part just because all of the easy stuff
on improving the blue part we have
already done so not only do we get lower
speed ups by improving
the blue part it's actually becoming
more difficult to do so this is sort of
a lesson to computer architects to not
go overboard improving the same thing
because the things they have already
improved are now a smaller percentage of
the new execution time and we need to
reassess what is now the dominant part
in the execution time in other words
once you have applied one improvement
you need to reconsider what is now the
new dominant part in the execution time
and definitely when applying Ambrose law
we need to consider what is now the
fraction enhanced and the fraction
unenhanced</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
