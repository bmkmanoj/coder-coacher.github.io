going to look a little more complicated
and you can skip this section if you'd
like it's not essential to the rest of
the lecture the idea is that at each
layer of your covenant you can make a
choice have a pulling operation have a
convolution and then you need to decide
is it a one by one convolution or three
by three or a five by five all of these
are actually beneficial to the modeling
power of your network so why choose
let's use them all here is what an
inception module looks like instead of
having a single convolution you have a
composition of average tooling followed
by one by one then one by one
convolution then a one by one followed
by a three by three then a one by one
fold by a five by five and at the top
you simply concatenate the output of
each of them it looks complicated but
what's interesting is that you can
choose these parameters in such a way
that the total number of parameters in
your model is very small yet the model
performs better than if you had a simple
convolution</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
