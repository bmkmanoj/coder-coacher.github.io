climbing me too it's certainly not
simulated annealing because there's no
annealing yep simulated otherwise you
might think its genetic algorithms
because you've got all of these centers
they're all moving around at once but
they're all a part of the ultimate
answer they're not populations so it's
really hill climbing you just take a
step towards a configuration that's a
better than the configuration you had
before that's right except what we
haven't said yet is the way we defined
hill climbing it actually evaluated the
score and chose a neighbor that
maximized the score and we didn't show
that these steps actually do that we
just define them in a particular way
here's the wicked cool thing it really
does do hill climbing it really does
find the neighbor that maximizes the
score minimizes the error in this case
so let's show that because it's kind of
neat every time I see this I'm always
surprised and delighted oh I'm looking
forward to being delighted</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
