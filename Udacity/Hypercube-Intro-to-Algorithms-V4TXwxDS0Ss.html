look at is called a hypercube and the
graph is almost but not quite as cool as
the name so we're going to define a
hypercube for any number of nodes as
long as that number of nodes is a power
of two so here we have four nodes that's
a power of two two squared and what
we're going to do is we're going to
connect edges up in a particular way and
this is how we're going to do it we're
going to imagine that every node has a
label and that label is a bit pattern in
particular and we imagine that we're
going to number each of the nodes
basically from 0 up to n minus 1 and
we're going to connect two nodes if
their bit patterns differ in exactly one
place so we see this example here if we
label the nodes these are now binary
numbers 0 1 2 3 we connect these two
nodes because they differ just in the
first bit 1 1 0 1 we connect these two
because they differ in the second bit 1
0 1 1 we connect these two because they
differ in the second place 0 0 0 1 and
we connect these two because they differ
in the first place 0 0 1 0 we can
generalize this to larger graphs so
here's a hypercube on 8 nodes can we
number the nodes from 0 to 7 in their
binary bit patterns and then we connect
to nodes if they differ in exactly one
bit place now we perhaps you can see why
these are called hyper cubes this is a
cube previous one was a square what's
the next one going to be so to generate
the hypercube for n equals 16 and do
this with a very very interesting little
trick we're going to do is we're going
to take two hyper cubes of size 8 and 8
now 8 and 8 is going to be 16 let's look
what we can do we can leave these bit
patterns the way that they are and then
we can extend them
everybody in this hypercube is going to
get a 0 out in front remember what that
means in terms of the binary numbers is
they stay the same a leading 0 doesn't
change anything but this second
hypercube everyone's going to get a 1
out in front again thinking about your
binary numbers what is that doing it's
adding 8 to all of the numbers of these
nodes giving unique bit patterns that we
haven't seen before and now if we
connect the corresponding corners of
these two cubes which is going to be a
little bit messy and I can draw them
deeper but it start to make the picture
a little distracting that is a 4
dimensional cube also known as a
hypercube we can keep extending this
over and over again
5 bit pattern 6 bit pattern 7 2 patterns
and each time what we're doing is
connecting two hyper cubes of the
previous size
standing them and then connecting the
corresponding vertices</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
