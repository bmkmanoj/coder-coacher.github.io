interesting processor today we'll start
with technology trends why the world has
gone parallel and first we'll start with
some good news
modern processors are made from
transistors and each year those
transistors get smaller and smaller this
graph is from Stanford CPU DB project
thanks guys
what it shows is the feature size of
processors over time where the feature
size is the minimum size of a transistor
or wire on a chip so what we're seeing
is this is time going in this direction
so that's a long time ago and that's
today and this is the feature size so
how big transistors are and notice that
it's getting smaller and smaller every
generation so when you hear talk about a
45 nanometer process or 22 nanometer
that's what we're referring to the
feature size so we see that it's
consistently going down over time as the
feature size decreases transistors get
smaller run faster use less power and we
can put more of them on a chip and the
consequence is that we have more and
more resources for computation every
single year however we've also got some
bad news
historically as transistors improved
processor designers would then increase
the clock rates of processors running
them faster and faster every year let's
take a look at this diagram of clock
speeds over the years so again we have
time going on this axis okay so a long
time ago today and here we have clock
frequency how fast were clocking these
transistors historically one of the
primary drivers of clock performance has
been clock speed increases we see over
many years we see clock speeds continue
to go up however over the last decade we
see that clock speeds have essentially
remained constant</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
