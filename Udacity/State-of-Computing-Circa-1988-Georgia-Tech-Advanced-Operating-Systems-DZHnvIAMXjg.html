AFS is the CMU campus and the user
community can access file servers using
workstations connected to a local area
network and as I mentioned local disks
on the workstation served as efficient
caches and the vision of the designers
of the Andrew file system and the coder
file system both of which were built at
CMU for enabling the student community
to access a central file system is as
follows a user walks up to any
workstation and logs into the
workstation and your content magically
appears on this workstation from the
central server as soon as you log in in
other words in the CMU experiment what
they wanted to afford the users to be
able to do is have this ability to walk
up to any workstation spread out
throughout the campus and be able to
access their personal information that
is stored in servers that are central to
the entire campus isn't that what
today's cloud computing and mobile
devices are trying to do to your content
in some sense you'll see that many of
the technologies that we take for
granted today had their modest
beginnings in experiments such as the
Andrew file system and the coda file
system at CMU</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
