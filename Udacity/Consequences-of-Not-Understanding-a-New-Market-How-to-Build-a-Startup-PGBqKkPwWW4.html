new market our essential first startup
this was a startup killer for decades in
a new market there are no customers
so revenues might extend out for years
in fact if you think about what happened
during the dot-com bubble in the
beginning of the 21st century is every
startup executed like they were in an
existing market they hired salespeople
they spent marketing dollars in in scale
of tens of millions of dollars trying to
create and user demand for a market that
didn't exist just imagine what would
have happened if those startups would
have parked their capital in a bank
getting interest and doing guerrilla
activities to help start the market
because the market wasn't there there is
no way any individual startup can
accelerate technology diffusion so for a
new market to take off lots of things
external to your startup need to happen
regulation needs to change platforms
need to become cheaper customer tastes
need to change etc the dot-com bubble
was actually predicated on all of these
things happening all at once and they
didn't and therefore all that money that
got raised got spent trying to acquire
customers whether there were none the
test for whether you're in a new market
is not whether 30 people in your
regional cluster or in Silicon Valley or
New York have heard about your
technology that the real test is whether
your grandmother in Omaha or Berlin or
in Uganda actually have heard about the
technology or the product or the market
if the market doesn't exist there you
might be spending a lot of money trying
to create a market where there is not
premature spending is the killer for
startups</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
