and how learning physically changes our
brain I was trying to find a really good
example of that and then I came across
the example you used in your book about
lending cab drivers can you give us a
bit about that that we got to so yeah
neuroscientists decided to study this
one group that really is intensively
involved in learning they can't use any
other map they can't use a physical map
that can't use GPS so they really truly
have to learn this very complicated
network of streets and it takes a months
and months and they have to pass a very
difficult exam and then for comparison
group they chose another group that did
a lot of driving so they didn't want to
explain any differences by driving alone
so they picked bus drivers now the thing
about bus drivers is they don't really
have to learn a whole lot they take the
same route every day and so on so then
when they look at the hippocampus of
these two groups brain region involved
in learning and memory the hippocampus
of the cab drivers was a lot more
complex and rich and bigger actually
than the bus drivers so this is just
another great example then of how
learning really does change the brain
I'm really glad that you mentioned the
hippocampus and learning because we're
actually going to go into talking about
the brain structures now so thank you a
lot for giving us an example</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
