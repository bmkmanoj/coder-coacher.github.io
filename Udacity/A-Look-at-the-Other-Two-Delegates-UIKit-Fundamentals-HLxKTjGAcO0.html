field any existing text clears so one
could guess that it happens where text
field did begin editing is called both
the emoji text field and the colorizer
text field are manipulating user
generated text so we can guess that
their delegates both implement should
change characters in range we also know
that in the colorizer the keyboard
dismisses upon pressing return so we can
guess that the color is our delegate
implements text field should return
let's take a look at the emoji delegate
if we look inside the text field did
begin editing method down here at the
end of the file we can see in this line
of code that as soon as the user clicks
into the text field the text is cleared
so what about the rest of the emoji
delegates functionality let's scroll up
to the top of the file up here we can
see a dictionary that map's animal words
to emoji symbols to replace those words
with by the way don't worry if you've
never seen a dictionary before we're
going to discuss Swift dictionaries in
the next lesson most of the action is
happening in this should change
characters in range method whenever the
text changes the delegate is told then
it proceeds through these steps it
constructs a new string it looks for
each emoji string and then replaces
emoji strings with emoji characters if
we replaced a string with an emoji we
return false here and if not we return
true and let the text field modify the
text now let's see how the colorizer
works remember the color eyes are closed
to the keyboard on pressing return which
is probably the user experience we're
after so let's take a look at how this
was done you'll want to scroll down to
where the text field should return
method is and here in the text field
should return method you can see this
call to text field resign first
responder any time a keyboard starts
editing we say that it becomes the first
responder that's why I touches to the
keyboard only show up in the current
text view instead of all of them
resigning this first responder status
dismisses the keyboard so what else is
going on in this delegate if we scroll
up to the top we can see that just like
the emoji delegate this colorizer
delegate also has a dick
canary this dictionary maps color
strings to you I color objects whenever
the text changes this loop finds all of
the color words in the new string it
creates an array of color objects
corresponding to the color strings and
then passes that array into a helper
method which blends the colors you can
see this blend color array helper method
down here and here you can see the text
color of the text field is being set to
the blended color</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
