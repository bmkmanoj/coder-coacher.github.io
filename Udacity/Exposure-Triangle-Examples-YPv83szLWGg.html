of help us think through this i'm going
to show you a whole lot of examples to
cover the space of what it means to go
from different values of the exposure
triangle let's take f-number 5.6 and i
will start off with a shutter speed of 1
over 10 this is the same scene and of
course because of the fact that the
aperture is open for a while and I'm
also keeping the shutter speed there is
a lot of light entering the sensor this
image might be referred to as
overexposed same aperture value I've now
basically gotten the shutter to work at
120th twice the speed of this twice as
fast of course here you can start seeing
that image is less overexposed then this
one and going down again doubling the
shutter speed doubling it more and now
you can start seeing that this image
actually seems to have less overexposure
than any one of them but I keep on going
there 2 1 160th same aperture value now
it might start getting darker more
darker even more darker and at now we're
getting into the range of underexposed
for those of you interested and you may
actually now start thinking about what
would the histograms of these images
would look like based on the lecture we
looked at before much darker image
nothing like this this would be
overexposed underexposed extremely
underexposed and because now we really
can't see any details let's now actually
move up and down this axis too so now
I'm actually going to take this speed
one or one hundredth of a second and
then I'm going to go in and actually
give it an F number of four point oh f 5
point oh this was 5.6 7.19 point 0 13
point 0 and 20 again you can see what
the impact was at which these of course
the images are much smaller so you can't
details of the depth of field kinds of
stuff here but this seems to be a nicely
exposed image little overexposed but
fine but as you go on increasing the
aperture size I'm sorry decree
using the aperture size we notice that
now we're getting a lot less light in
there so here we went this direction and
we basically make the shutter speed
faster and here we went down this way
and basically made the aperture smaller
these two are under exposed these two
are overexposed we can imagine actually
filling this complete matrix out but
that would have been a too crowded of a
slide I just wanted to show you the
impact of all of this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
