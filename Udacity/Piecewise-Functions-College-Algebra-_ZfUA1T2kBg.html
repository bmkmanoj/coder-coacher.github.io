what we get is actually a function we
can tell since it passes the vertical
line test this kind of function is
called a piecewise function because well
it's defined in different pieces since
different functions are defined in
different parts of the domain there have
to be at least two different equations
defined in different parts of the domain
for a function to be considered a
piecewise function what I'd like to know
is what part of the domain each of these
functions occupies I'm going to switch
over to piecewise function notation
right now so you can get an idea of what
that looks like so this is what typical
piecewise function notation looks like
you can see that instead of separate
equations for each part of the line over
here we've effectively merged them into
one using this brace this curly thing
right here this shows that all of these
different function pieces are part of a
single function f of X now the other
important feature of piecewise function
notation is this section over here to
the right this is where we show the
domain that each part of the function
occupies often you'll see a comma used
between the equations for the different
parts of the functions and their domain
but sometimes you'll see the word for
written here instead like this to save
space i'm going to use commas right now
but either way is acceptable now looking
at the graph and thinking back to what
you learned about grants tax brackets
before please fill in the different
numbers that belong in these boxes to
show what the domain of each piece of
the function is now I've been nice and
I've already filled in the inequality
signs for you so all we need here are
the numbers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
