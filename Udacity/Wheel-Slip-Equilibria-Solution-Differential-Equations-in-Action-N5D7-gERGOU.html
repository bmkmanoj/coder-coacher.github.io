equilibrium and one unstable equilibrium
and now they discuss the details let's
take this equation and put it in this
form so it's easier to see what has to
be balanced the force divided by the
mass has to balance the deceleration by
the break the fast can be expressed with
the help of the friction coefficient the
mass of one quarter of the car and the
gravitational acceleration so this
equation bolts down to the following
that the coefficient of friction has to
equal the deceleration of the wheel over
the gravitational acceleration times the
ratio of the masses and now we can check
with our diagram what this means if you
break with an intensity slightly below
the optimum the coefficient of friction
has to be on such a line slightly below
its maximum value this has to be the
value of our coefficient of friction and
hence of the right hand side we have two
options to satisfy this equality and
hence two possible equilibria this value
of s and this value of s the lower one
is stable the upper one is unstable I'll
just illustrate one part of the argument
for that imagine s was a little lower
than the value of the equilibrium then
we would have less friction because the
coefficient of friction decreases but if
we have less friction the brake X
stronger on the wheel which means it's
going to increase we'd slip we're moving
in that blocking direction which means
upwards so from the left side this
equilibrium is stable so when we are
slightly below this equilibrium point if
you're moving up and you can argue in a
similar fashion that we are slightly
below that point if you are moving down
for this point it's the other way around
if we are slightly below we keep on
moving down if you're slightly above we
keep on moving up so once we have passed
that point we inevitably run into
locking a wheel slip of one and strictly
speaking there's a third equilibrium
which is stable again when the wheel
slip is one that means when the wheel is
locked the deceleration by the break
always superseded
the force applied through friction we
are going to stay in that locked state
there's a practical consequence of this
if you push the bag too hard you're
inevitably going to lock the wheels
which is far less than optimal if we
really strong on the brakes there is no
equilibrium below as equals one at all
no matter what we are going to end up
with locked wheels</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
