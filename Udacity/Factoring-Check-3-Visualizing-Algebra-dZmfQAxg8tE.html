multiplying 5 and 2 which equals 10 7 is
the x term so that goes into the bottom
we want to find a factor pair of 10 that
sums to seven that must be two and five
we can rewrite the 7x as positive two x
and positive 5x now we use factoring by
grouping to finish out our problem from
the first two terms I can factor out an
X leaving me with 5x plus two the second
two terms are a little bit tricky they
don't share a factor of 5 of X or two
but they do share a factor of 1 we can
always factor out a 1 if it appears that
two terms do not have common factors our
final factored form is X plus 1 times 5x
plus 2 I want to acknowledge that
there's other ways to factor this you
might have switched the 5x and the 2x
and then continued factoring by grouping
that would work as well as a quick check
on the end we can do some mental math to
make sure this factored form is equal to
this polynomial x x 5 x is 5x squared 1
x 5 x is 5x + x times 2 is 2x if i add
5x and 2x together i'll get 7x and
finally 1 times 2 is positive 2</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
