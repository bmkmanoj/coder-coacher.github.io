screen density for devices a designer
might create a pixel perfect logo or
other graphic in Photoshop now that was
fine until more screen densities started
coming along like hdpi and xhdpi you'd
need to redraw the pixels in the graphic
at a larger size to ensure it was the
same physical size but looks perfectly
crisp on that higher density screen with
four or five popular density buckets
these days this practice can get really
tedious really really quickly designers
who don't want to repeat themselves
should use a graphics app that can work
with an export vector graphics apps like
Photoshop and GIMP are geared primarily
to working with raster graphics that
means they store the actual color
information for each pixel in the
resulting image those raster images can
be scaled down with no problem but you
start to see blurring and other bad
artifacts when you enlarge them vector
graphics apps like Inkscape illustrator
and sketch instead store information
about the individual shapes in the image
for example the center and the radius of
a circle so you can scale the image up
or down without any loss of quality the
shapes will just be drawn at a larger
size while Photoshop lets you work with
vector graphics - illustrator and sketch
actually let you export your graphics to
vector formats like SVG or scalable
vector graphics in newer versions of
Android you can directly use vector
images in your app using a format
similar to basic SVG sure beats
exporting a whole bunch of PNG files
over and over again right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
