numbers for a long division are we only
concerned about the answer well no math
is about reasoning and we can use that
reasoning and new situations like here
we'll use our understanding of dividing
numbers to divide polynomials to divide
X plus 5 into x squared plus 7x plus 10
we're going to start with these first
two terms I want to think about the
expression that I could put here to
multiply by X to get x squared in other
words I'm taking x squared and dividing
it by X that variable must be ex next we
multiply X by X and positive 5 and we
get x squared plus 5x this step was very
similar to multiplying 2 times 4 to get
the eight now that we're here we want to
subtract so i want to subtract this
entire amount or expression this is
really a negative 1 times each of these
quantities so we want to make sure that
we change both of the signs when i
subtract the amount i'll have negative x
squared and negative 5x both of the
signs change x squared minus x squared
equals 0 + 7 x minus 5x equals 2x next
we bring down the 10 to continue the
next step of our long division problem
now I want you to try that same process
again you're going to divide X plus 5
into 2 X plus 10 what number would go
here and then when you multiply this
number by X plus 5 what two expressions
do you get here then you're going to
subtract this quantity and put in your
final answers down here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
