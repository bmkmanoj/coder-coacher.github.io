talk about the problem we're going to
focus on for the rest of this class
we're going to look at a certain period
of data trainer models over that period
and then make forecasts and trade over
some other period so here's our
historical data we're going to use the
period of 2009 as our data to train our
model you'll be implementing several
machine learning algorithms to create
different models and we'll be comparing
them one against the other then we'll
test over the years 2010 and 2011
so those testing values will become our
X which will push through the model to
create a Y or a forecast and using this
forecasts you'll generate on orders that
text file which you can push through
your market simulator
we'll see how that strategy performs
measure its Sharpe ratio and its total
return and so on and that way we'll be
able to compare different machine
learning algorithms that generate these
orders that's it for this lesson our
introduction to machine learning and how
it works at hedge funds and other
financial institutions I will see you
online again soon bye-bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
