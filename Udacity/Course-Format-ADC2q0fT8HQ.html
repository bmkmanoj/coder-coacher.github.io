this first lesson we'll be giving you an
overview of what a/b testing is and what
it can and can't be used for we'll also
go over an example a t-test from start
to finish so that you can see what the
whole process looks like in that example
we'll first choose a metric for an
experiment then review some necessary
statistics then we'll design our
experiment and finally we'll analyze the
results then each subsequent lesson of
the course we'll dive into more detail
on a particular part of the process in
lesson 2 you'll be learning about how to
protect the participants of your
experiment and what questions you should
be asking yourself regarding the
ethicality of experiments in lesson 3
we'll go into more detail on choosing
and characterizing metrics to use when
evaluating your experiment in lesson 4
we'll talk more about designing your
experiment which includes choosing which
users go in your control group and your
experiment group and in lesson 5 will go
over lots of examples of what your
results could look like how to analyze
those results and how to draw valid
conclusions now you won't need any prior
experience with a/b testing in order to
take this course because we'll be
covering it from the ground up and he
will need any programming experience
either because this course won't cover
how to implement an a/b testing
framework it's about how to design and
analyze experiments introductory
knowledge of statistics on the other
hand will be required so if you need to
brush up check out the links in the
instructors notes now throughout the
course I'll be going over lots of
examples and giving you opportunities to
practice what you're learning
I'll also be having conversations with
Diane and Cary about their experiences
in a/b testing let's do that now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
