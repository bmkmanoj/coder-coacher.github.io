of different equations to this new form
which is really helpful for us in
certain ways but there are a lot of
different equations for parabolas that
don't look just like these two in
particular what if our equation doesn't
have a leading coefficient of one
leading coefficient here refers to the
coefficient in front of the x squared
term the term with the highest power in
both of these situations that
coefficient is one which we know makes
factoring a lot simpler and presumably
also changes how we complete the square
in fact recall the equation that we came
up with as our final equation for
calculating grants profit based on the
price that he charges per glasses wiper
set last lesson we had p equals negative
200 c squared plus 18,400 c minus 130
3200 here our leading coefficient is
negative 200 that's certainly not equal
to 1 if we want to find out exactly
where the vertex of this equation is
we're going to need to get this in that
new form using completing the square
well we'll get to solving this
eventually but for now I'd like us to
start out with an equation similar to
this and that its leading coefficient is
not 1 and then we'll work through that
to eventually be able to deal with grant
situation here I've graphed the
equations y equals x squared that parent
probably seen so many times and then a
second parabola y equals 3x squared this
green one right here so judging from the
relationship between these two graphs
how does multiplying the leading
coefficient of a parabola change the
shape of the parabola does it shift it
vertically shift it horizontally make it
wider or make it more narrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
