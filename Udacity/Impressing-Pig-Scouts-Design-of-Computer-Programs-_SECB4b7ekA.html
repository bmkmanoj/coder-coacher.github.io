define a set of strategies the clueless
strategy we expect to do the worst
strategies that try to solve the problem
in in four chunks and three chunks and
two chunks and to solve it all in one
win and then the max wind strategy now
we play tournament with these strategies
and here's the results we get back so
you can see the clueless strategy does
very poorly only run wins 23 games out
of five hundred the max win strategy
does the best of all wins 325 but
there's some competitors that are pretty
close so hold at 20 wins 314 not that
much worse off than the optimal strategy
and that holds up if we play a
tournament with more games just to get a
little bit more accuracy you wouldn't be
able to hit the Run button and do this
because it would timeout but if you
bring it into your own development
environment you can do that and here we
see max wins gets 13,000 100 wins and
hold at 20 is 12900 so only a couple
percent better for max wins over hold at
20 but still it's nice to know that no
strategy can do better and it turns out
that if we increase the goal made a
longer game than just playing to 40
points that the advantage for max wins
over any of these other strategies would
only increase now in the betting game we
had different utility functions we tried
out the linear utility and we try it out
the logarithmic utility what about here
well we defined our utility as a
probability of winning and the way the
games defined that's really the only
sensible one if if you're trying to win
the game you should maximize the
probability of winning but may be your
only goal isn't just to maximize the
probability of winning so maybe you're
in a big pig tournament and you're
seated at the pig table rolling the dice
and in the stands are lots of spectators
watching the game with excitement and
you know that somewhere in the stands
there's a scout from the NPA the
national pig Association and what you
want to do is not just win the game
because lots of people are going to win
the
means but you really want to get the
attention of that NP a scout so that you
can move on and have a professional
career so maybe what your utility
function would be would not just be to
win the game maybe your utility would be
to maximize the differential to say you
know if I just won the game by a couple
points nobody's going to notice but if I
won by a lot if I really clobbered my
opponent then maybe this guy would take
notice and that would be worth more to
me so you'd give up on the goal of just
winning and try to go for the maximizing
your differential</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
