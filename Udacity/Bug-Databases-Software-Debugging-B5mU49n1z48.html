product you will get many of these bug
reports and you must make sure that no
bug report ever gets lost and also that
all these bug reports eventually get
handled in finite time but before that
you'd have to store these problem
reports somewhere that you can classify
them mark them and evaluate them and
this is the task of a problem database
simply speaking a problem database holds
all problems that ever occurred with
some product whenever somebody reports a
problem either through an automatic
means or as a regular user all of these
problems get stored in the problem
database you may wonder how many of
these bug reports end up with large
companies over time actually this
problem databases are huge I don't know
how this is for Apple but I've been the
first non-microsoft researcher ever to
peek into the problem database of
Microsoft I can't tell you the exact
number of bug reports that are in there
but if you consider that Microsoft has
sold 450 million of windows seven
licenses and if every user just
experiences one such crash per month
that's more than 37 million bug reports
each year and this is only from people
who actually click on the send button I
guess there's a number of people who run
Microsoft but don't have a proper
license and prefer not to tell Microsoft
about their problems</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
