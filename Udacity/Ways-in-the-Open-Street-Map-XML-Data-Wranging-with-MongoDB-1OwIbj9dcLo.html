study so far what I'd like to do here is
set us up for the portion of the case
study where you're going to be cleaning
your data now before we dive into the
code what I'd like to do is just remind
you where the documentation is for the
OpenStreetMap data set the easiest place
to find it is through the wiki and I
purposely kept this page a little small
just so positionally you'll remember
where to find the documentation so what
we're looking for here is the OSM XML
link okay and I'll just make the page
big enough so you can actually read the
documentation now what I'm interested in
you seeing is the way in which the XML
file is organized into nodes and ways
and also relations now the thing to note
here is that our data is set up so that
nodes can be tagged as can ways all
right
and the semantics of this type of
structure here is that these tags
because they're nested within this node
actually tag this particular node here
and the same is true with way tags that
we find so here we're seeing tags that
are actually describing this particular
way here okay so it's actually pretty
straightforward but in terms of parsing
it we have to remember that in order to
understand exactly what a given tag tag
describes okay so what I'd like to do in
this example is talk a little bit about
cleaning street names now back in lesson
3 we actually looked quickly at an
example of auditing street names we're
going to take that example a little bit
further and here we're actually going to
apply it two ways now ways in this data
set are streets they're essentially
paths through a city of one kind or
another
so avenues squares Commons other sorts
of areas that are a way of getting from
one place to another is essentially how
Way is defined in this data set</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
