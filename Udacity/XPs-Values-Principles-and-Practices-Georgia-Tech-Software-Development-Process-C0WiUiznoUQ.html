XPS values and principles that I just
hinted on earlier in the lesson the
first one the first important value is
communication there is no good project
without good communication and XP tries
to keep the right communication flowing
and is using several practices to do
that
it's got practices based on and required
communication and in general shared
information for example pair programming
and we're going to say more about that
user stories customer involvement all
activities that help communication that
foster communication another important
principle that we already saw its
simplicity and the model here is live
for today without worrying too much
about the future when you have to do
something look for the simplest thing
that works and the emphasis here is on
that works we want to build something
simple but not something stupid feedback
that's extremely important in XP and it
occurs at different levels and it is
used to drive changes for example
developers write test cases and that's
immediate feedback if your test cases
fail there's something wrong with the
code or there's something that you still
haven't developed developers also
estimate new stories right away as soon
as they get them from the customer and
that's immediate feedback to the
customer and finally on a slightly
longer timeframe customers and testers
developed together functional sips and
test cases to assess the overall system
and also in this case that's a great way
to provide feedback and by the way also
to help communication and finally
courage the courage to throw away code
if it doesn't work to change it if you
find a way to improve it to fix it if
you find a problem to try out new things
if you think that they might work better
than what you have right now now that we
can build and test systems very quickly
we can be much braver than what we were
before so how do we accomplish all that
and what are XP practices that are going
to help us follow these principles and
ideal to those values these are some of
XP practices there are more but those
are the ones that I'd like to discuss in
a little more depth individually
incremental planning small releases
simple design test first
refactoring we will actually have a
whole lesson next on refactoring pair
programming continuous integration and
on-site customer so let's start with
incremental planning</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
