with some funny answers and so depending
on your thinking you might have picked
any of these answers I personally though
think that the best answer is the third
one to count them if the teacher counts
our students before they leave and then
counts them at different points during
their time at the zoo she can know
pretty easily whether or not they are
all sticking together congratulations on
completing your first quiz of the class
whether you pick the same answer as I
did or not you'll encounter many quizzes
like this throughout the rest of the
course although they probably won't all
be as silly as this one but please
remember that even as we dig deeper into
algebra the point of all of these
quizzes will be for you to check if you
understand the material just give each
question some thought and if you're
having trouble choosing an answer
re-watch the video or a couple of videos
preceding the quiz if you get a question
right that's awesome and if you miss one
that's not a big deal at all just try it
again and submit your new answer you can
redo each question as many times as you
need to we want you to do whatever you
need to do to really understand the
material</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
