it has several steps the first is to
take the name of your algorithm and head
on to Google to do some research get a
general understanding of what the
algorithm does if you can explain the
algorithm to a friend for example then
you probably understand it well enough
that you're ready to move on to the next
step then what I suggest you do is find
the SK learn documentation for this
algorithm exactly the way we've been
doing all throughout this course
remember that the SK learn documentation
also usually has examples this will be a
huge help for you in the next step step
number three which is to deploy the
algorithm get your hands dirty try to
get it running at least that's of course
the first thing that you need before you
can go on to step number four which is
using it to make some predictions about
the test set and then of course you use
those predictions to evaluate it what's
the accuracy on the test set I've given
you a set of starter code that has all
the training and testing data ready to
go there's also a function in there that
allows you to plot it so you can
visualize the decision boundary which is
always something that's really nice to
do at the time you've completed this
process you will be a real machine
learning expert in the sense that maybe
you don't know everything yet but very
few machine learning experts would say
they know everything the thing that
separates the good ones from the great
ones is very often that they're able to
go out and learn something new and this
is your chance to do that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
