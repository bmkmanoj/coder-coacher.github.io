manual transmission and you've ever let
the battery die
well there's a good chance you've had to
push your car let's talk about the
forces involved in pushing a car so
let's say we're lucky enough to have
three people pushing this car our green
and purple haired doctors and oh I don't
know Albert Einstein and let's say we're
looking at this car from above so here's
our bird's-eye view of the car from
above and the mass of this car is 1,000
kilograms and let's say Einstein is
pushing from directly behind here's the
top of Einstein's head and there's arms
the green hair doctor is pushing from
the side add a small angle you'll notice
purple hair doctor is pushing from the
other side also at a small angle and
let's say an interesting fact about this
group of friends is that they can all
push with exactly the same force and
when they all push from this car at the
same time with this exact same force the
acceleration of the car is 0.5 meters
per second squared the angle that the
green and purple haired doctors are
pushing with will call alpha and for
this problem
alpha is thirty degrees so they're
pushing at a 30-degree angle ayan Stein
here is pushing directly up on the back
of the car but these guys are doing it
at a 30-degree angle I want you to tell
me with what force is each person push
