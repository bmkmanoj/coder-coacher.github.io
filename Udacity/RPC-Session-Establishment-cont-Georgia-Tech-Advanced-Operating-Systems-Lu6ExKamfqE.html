genuine and the server is genuine now
what once again we go back to the
principle of not over exposing any ID or
password for too long on unsecure links
remember that the login session used the
username and password exactly once
now the RPC session you may be
establishing multiple RPC sessions or
the lifetime of the login session once a
login session has been established then
you are establishing the RPC session now
within this RPC session you may be
making a number of file system calls and
for all of those file system calls you
don't want to over expose the use of
this handshake key and therefore what
the server does in the Andrew file
system is use this handshake key only
for establishing an RPC session let's
say within a login session you have
three or four different RPC sessions
with the server three or four unique RPC
sessions for each one of those unique
RPC sessions you have to use the
handshake key to establish the RPC
session but within an RPC session what
you're doing is you're making a whole
bunch of secure RPC calls to the server
for opening files and retrieving new
files writing files and so on and for
all of those we don't want to overuse
this handshake key and that's the reason
what the server does once it validates
the identity of the client it generates
a session key which is for this
particular RPC session now it's going to
send this new session key I generated
for this particular RPC session as an
encrypted cipher to the client using the
handshake key as the private key for
encrypting this message and now Venis
can
extract the session key using HKC to
decrypt this message and this SK is the
session key for use for this particular
RPC session for the rest of this RPC
session anytime the client wants to open
a file or close a file or write a file
or read a file all of those file system
operations is going to use a session key
as the handshake key for the rest of the
RPC session with the server for a second
field num is the starting sequence
number that Venus will use on behalf of
the client for all the file system
related RPC calls that are going to be
made as part of this particular session
for this session
eske is going to be the handshake key
and the sequence number is going to
start here this is again a safeguard
against replay attacks on the server by
someone masquerading as a client and
generating packets with certain sequence
numbers so let's recap what we went over
for session establishment the first
message coming from the client to the
server tells the server that a client is
wanting to establish a new or PC session
the server has to authenticate whether
that particular session establishment
request is genuine or not and the client
has to know that it is really talking to
a genuine server and that's this pair of
communication that you're seeing here
want to establish to the client that the
server is genuine the second to
established to the server that the
client is genuine and once the
genuineness of the client and the server
has been established the services for
this particular RPC session we will not
use this handshake key anymore for the
rest of the communication that we want
to do for file system operations I will
generate a new session key SK give it to
you along with the sequence number to
use as a starting sequence number
for RPC calls during this session that's
the whole exchange that we're seeing
here now it is time for a quiz</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
