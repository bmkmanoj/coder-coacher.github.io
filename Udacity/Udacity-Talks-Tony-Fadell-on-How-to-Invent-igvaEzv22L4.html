helps you Tony to constantly invent well
I think it's two things I think it's a
great question the first one is about
curiosity it's being curious and the
other one is being frustrated when
you're frustrated then you're curious as
to why am I frustrated and you clue into
those things so you can figure out
what's wrong and then fix it most people
that i know of frustrated just grumpy
grumpy little man well you know me very
well I I know you're really well Tony
but I want to tell our students what's
the difference between just being
frustrated and what do you do well the
difference is is being frustrated
recognizing that and then taking that
emotion and turning to the positive
light to then go why is it this way so
you could always just run around and
complain about everything right but you
have to take it harness that energy turn
it into positive be curious learn why it
is and sometimes you'll find out the
reason why it is is because of the
constraints at the time and so if you
look a lot of things in the world they
were designed 10 20 30 years ago they
are not a modern design and that's where
you can actually figure out where you
can innovate and create a new business
or a new product or what have you to
make the world a better place</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
