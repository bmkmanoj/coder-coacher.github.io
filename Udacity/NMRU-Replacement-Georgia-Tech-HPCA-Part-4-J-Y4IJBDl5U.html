so-called LRU approximation algorithms
which this one is called NMR you or not
most recently used and it's trying to
approximate the performance of LRU but
with less activity on hits so again NMR
U stands for not most recently used the
way it would work is that we would track
which one block in the set is the most
recently used one at any given time and
then when we need to replace something
we pick a block that is not the block
that is the most recently used so for
example we can pick randomly among the
other blocks but we save the most
recently used block from eviction from
the cache so how do we track which block
is mru let's say we have an N way set
associative cache and we want to track
the meu block for each set we need only
one mru pointer per set we only need to
know which block has been the most
recently accessed one in the set so for
example if we have a 2-way
set-associative cache we only need one
bit to tell us which of the two is the
most recently accessed if we have a
4-way set associative cache we will have
a two bit pointer that tells us which of
the four has been the most recently
accessed and so on compare this to an
LRU counters that we need per set in a
4-way set associative cache we would
need a two bit pointer for NMR you we
would need four two-bit LRU counters to
maintain LRU so this policy keeps n
times less State for an N wasted
associative cache then the true LRU
policy it turns out that this policy
works reasonably well it does have a hit
rate that is slightly lower than a true
LRU but if this is what it takes to make
our cache go from two cycles hit time to
one cycle hit time it might be worth it
a disadvantage of this policy is that
although it prevents the most recently
accessed line from being evicted
know what the order is among the rest of
them so there is a truly least recently
used block among these three for example
but we don't know which one so we'll
pick one of these three and might select
something that is not the least recently
used so although this works well because
the most frequently existing will be
saved in the cache it is slightly weaker
than through all of you because of this
because it doesn't know which one is the
really least recently used so what we
might want to have is a policy that is
still simpler than LRU but keeps more
track about what's less recently used
than the mru</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
