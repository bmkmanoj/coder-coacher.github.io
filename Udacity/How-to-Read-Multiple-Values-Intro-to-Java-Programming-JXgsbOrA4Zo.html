many inputs here when you look at these
adorable kittens of course you want to
pet them all but if you're a vet you
might also need to know that their
weight the average weight which one's
the largest which one it's the smallest
and so on so a program that processes
data like that needs to read in all of
that information it needs to
specifically in this case to read in the
weight of every kitten so we might want
a prompt to enter the first weight the
user enters first kitten weighs 100
grams we get the prompt for the second
weight the user interests prompt for the
third weight and so on but when do we
stop maybe we could have asked the user
how many values are you going to enter
but that's a little clumsy particularly
when there's lots of values there's a
common solution to this problem and that
is to ask the user to enter some input
that definitely can't be the right value
in this case here we might ask the user
to enter zero because no kitten can
weigh zero grams such a value is called
a sentinel value</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
