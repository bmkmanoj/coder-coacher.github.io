we're defining a procedure giving it the
name find second it has two inputs one
name for the input would be search and
target the names could be anything you
want but it makes sense to give them
names that tell us what we're doing and
then the first thing we need to do is
find the first occurrence so we're going
to use search dot find passing and
target to find the first occurrence and
now we're going to store them in a
variable to find the position of the
second occurrence we have to do search
again so we're going to call search dot
find this time we need to have the
second input which is first plus one to
say find the first occurrence after this
position we'll store that in the
variable second and we'll return second
and so that was the implementation that
was used in the test we could make this
a little simpler so one way to make this
simpler we don't need to actually have
the variable second we could return
second right away and so now we only
have two lines and we'll run the same
test just to show that it still works we
could even make it simpler than this we
don't even really need the variable
first right we could replace first here
with the search to find the first
occurrence then we don't need the
variable first we only need one line
it's a good question which of these is
the best I think probably the one before
this was actually better than this this
is a complicated enough expression that
it's hard to read we're separating it
into the variable first and then using
first here has exactly the same meaning
produces the same result this is a
little bit easier to understand what's
going on so I think I'd prefer this
version I was the procedure but either
one certainly is okay and either one
works well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
