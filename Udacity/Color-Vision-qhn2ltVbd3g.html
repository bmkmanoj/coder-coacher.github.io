really doing is assembling an array of
colors if you've ever looked at your
computer monitor under a magnifying
glass you've probably noticed that each
pixel is actually three vertical
rectangles one red one green and one
blue and yet when you take away the
magnifying glass the pixel can look like
any color at all pretty weird right this
works because the human eye isn't as
good at distinguishing colors as you
might think our eyes can't actually tell
the exact energy of an incoming photon
so here is our eyeball and here's the
cornea and here's the retina and here's
the optic nerve now the actual sensors
in the eye are three types of cone cells
and each of these type of cone cells
collects photons of a particular range
of wavelengths if a photon falls in the
range of the L or long wavelength cone
sell our brain perceives it as read if
the wavelength is a little shorter and
falls into an M or medium cone cell then
it looks green and if the photon has a
super short wavelength and stimulates
the S cone it appears blue all other
colors are just how our brain interprets
photons that stimulate multiple types of
cone cells at once since red green and
blue light each directly stimulate one
of the types of cone cells this means we
can simulate any other color by
replicating how that color would
stimulate the cone cells for instance
the color yellow is the result of
stimulating both the L and the am cones
but it doesn't matter to our brain
exactly what photons were involved it
could be a yellow laser where every
photon has exactly the same energy or it
could be an even combination of green
and red light the response of the LNM
cones is the same either way so to our
brain it's the same color the
unintuitive result is that any visible
color can be generated by a combination
of red green and blue human color vision
is a crazy topic and you can check out
