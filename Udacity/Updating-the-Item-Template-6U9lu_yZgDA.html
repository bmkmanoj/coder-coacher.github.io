each of the menu items these files are
in the instructor notes the process to
get a menu items data is almost exactly
the same as what we just did with menu
when the URL is item / some item name
ember calls the item round again we use
the model hook to fetch the data but how
will ever know which item to get the
item will be stored an item underscore
name the model hook is passed the params
object and we can get the item name off
of that object now let's update the item
template just like updating the menu
template we need to replace the static
info with the dynamic data provided by
the JSON file remember that the data
returned from the model hook is stored
in a model variable and now we can
finally see the other menu items awesome
have you noticed that clicking back and
forth though shows us a blank page for a
few seconds let's fix that the problem
is that we're using an anchor tag to
linked to specific URLs instead of
letting ember manage the URLs for us
ember provides us a template helper
called link to the link to help our
needs to know which route it should link
to we want this link to link to the item
round so item should go here the item
route it needs to have an item so we
need to give one to the link to helper
one thing that would trip me up in the
beginning is that this one needs quotes
but this one doesn't says it's using the
local item variable using link to with
nested routes is very similar because
the nutrition route is nested inside
item the right we need to reference in
the link to helper is item nutrition we
don't need to worry about which item to
use because to display the nutrition
template will already be on this item
page ember knows that and handles that
for us for more information on the link
to helper check the link in the
instructor notes now there are no page
refreshes in all transitions are smooth
and instantaneous in what's cool is that
the back button works with all this to</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
