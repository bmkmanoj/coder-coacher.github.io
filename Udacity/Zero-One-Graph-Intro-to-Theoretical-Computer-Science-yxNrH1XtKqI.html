graphs in this course we need to find a
way to efficiently represent them in a
program there are a lot of different
ways of doing this and they're really
based on certain trade-offs such as
memory requirements speed of certain
operations modifying the graph
determining the neighbors of a vertex
etc and what you want to do and how you
want to represent them and really
depends on the specific problem you're
talking about but let's take a look at a
fairly simple way of representing a
graph and that's called an adjacency
matrix an adjacency matrix specifies
which vertices are connected to which
other vertices so let's go ahead and
explain by building this adjacency
matrix for this graph so let's look at a
a well a isn't connected to a and we're
going to represent that by writing down
a 0 a however is connected to B and
we're going to specify that by putting a
1 in this location similarly a is
connected to C and a is not connected to
D at least not directly and that's
really what an adjacency matrix cares
about all right so an adjacency matrix
is really pretty simple you just put a 0
everywhere where one of the vertices the
row vertice is not connected to the
column vertice and vice versa since
there's no direction here and you put a
1 everywhere where the row vertice is
connected to the column vertice and so
you see that the matrix is symmetric
that is it's mirrored right about the
diagonal here so a is connected B which
means that well B is also connected to a
it's not necessarily the case if you
have a direction on each of these arrows
but we're not going to worry about that
right now now what I'd like you to do is
give me the best possible o notation
running time for each operation below
we're going to assume a graph with n
vertices represented as an adjacency
matrix we're also going to assume that
the time it takes to access any
particular element is constant and that
the memory needed to represent a list of
n elements is ordering
so give me the big o-notation
of the time it takes to represent all of
these</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
