but if you thought ring that was true
for a little while and if you thought
hypercube that was true pretty much for
the same amount of time and I actually
thought the answer was hypercube until I
drew out a picture and discovered that
it wasn't so here's why again in the
case where N equals one it's just a
single node the case of N equals 2 it's
one single node that's half the graph
and one single no that's the other half
of the graph and then individual sub
graphs have their nodes randomly ordered
but there's just one of them so there's
only one order and then we connect up
the corresponding nodes but there's just
one of them so it's just that okay in
the end equals 4 case we have two equals
two graphs and then the algorithm
arbitrarily orders the two nodes and the
two sub graphs but it looks the same
either way if we flip this around it
still looks the same so let's pretend I
flip this one around and then we connect
up the corresponding nodes and now we
get something that is a ring it's also a
hypercube actually all these have been
hyper cube so far all right let's move
up to N equals 8 so in the end equals 8
case we first generate to N equals four
graphs which we know what they look like
from before then we arbitrarily order
these nodes in the two different graphs
and connect up the corresponding nodes
so this is where it gets sort of weird
so in a normal hyper to but we would
connect this corner this corner this
corner let's start off that way because
the nodes are randomly ordered we could
actually get something like this where
the top is nice and parallel when the
bottom is Crossy this is not a hypercube
but is sort of hypercube ish and as we
grow this to larger and larger n we get
tangler and tangler structures and so
the nice thing about these structures is
they do kind of have an essence of
looking like real social network graphs
they have some complexity to them
there's not quite what we're looking for
but let's do an analysis of this graph
then call it a day so we can express the
number of edges in the tangled hypercube
again using a recurrence relation so now
the recurrence relation has this form
for an end node graph we generate two
and over to note graphs connect up the
kind of parallel nodes and that
introduces an new edges once again we
can think about this is happening in a
kind of recursion tree we first consider
generating and graph with n nodes we do
that by generating two graphs and over
to each of those actually requires two
graphs of size n over for each of these
levels we're going to be generating and
new edges at this top level and over to
for this sub graph and then over to for
this sub graph which adds up to n and
for for this one and over for for this
one n over 4 for this one and over for
for this one which adds up to N and I
don't know if you can see what's going
to happen here but we get n edge
contributions at each of these levels
and you may recall that there are log
and levels to this tree the end of the
day the total number of edges that are
created is n times the logarithm of n or
n log in this basic structure comes up a
lot in algorithm analysis which is one
of the reasons that I was generating the
graph this way what we're going to get
into next time is actually running some
algorithms on graphs of various sorts
and trying to analyze the algorithms to
see how long they actually take to run</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
