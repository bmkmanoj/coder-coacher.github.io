use the concept of learning zones to
help me map out my new journey as a new
programmer I always reflected on the
skills I was learning and tracked
whether i was in my safe zone where
concepts are familiar and where we don't
need to take any risks stretch zone
where we were introduced to new concepts
and we're making new discoveries or
strain zone where learning becomes
difficult and is often blocked by a
sense of frustration the border between
the stretch and the strain zone is the
points of maximum learning our goal is
to keep you between your stretch and
your strain zone so you are always
learning whenever you learn something
new you may feel like you're learning
zones are fluctuating one moment you
could be in your safe zone and the next
minute you're in your strain zone this
should be totally expected learning
something new especially programming can
be a winding journey with many highs and
lows let's read a little bit more about
your learning zones</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
