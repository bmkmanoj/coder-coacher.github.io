that 95% of sample means will be within
2 standard deviations from the mean most
likely this sample mean here is one of
the 95% that will fall within two
standard deviations of the new sampling
distribution if everyone used the Bieber
tweeter so in other words we have this
new predicted population mean we'll call
it mu sub BT for Bieber tweeter our best
guess for this is 40 but it'll be within
an interval around 40 most likely and we
know that 95% of sample means just of
people who use the Bieber tweeter will
be within this interval well most likely
this is one of those 95% let's assume
that this is in that interval if this
sample mean is indeed within this
interval then what could the population
mean B well if 40 is in this interval we
know 40 has to be greater than this but
smaller than this do you remember how to
solve inequalities like this so we're
trying to solve for the population mean
so let's subtract it from all three
sides of this inequality if we do that
then these cancel and these cancel so
we're left with negative 2 times the
standard error is less than 40 minus the
population mean is less than positive 2
times a standard error
now I'll subtract 40 from all three
sides of the equation so here we get
negative 40 and now the last thing we
need to do is to make this positive so
we'll multiply by negative one on all
three sides when we multiply or divide
by a negative number these inequalities
go the opposite way when we multiply
this by negative one we get positive 40
plus two
I'm Sigma over root n is greater then
positive the population mean is greater
than positive 40 my
two times the standard error and now we
have this gorgeous interval so let's
recap really quick we know that 95% of
sample means will fall within two
standard errors of the population mean
we're guessing that the sample mean we
have is one of those ninety-five percent
that falls within this interval and if
that's the case we're pretty sure that
the population mean then is between this
sample mean plus or minus two times the
standard error</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
