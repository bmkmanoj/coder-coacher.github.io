let's assume that F is a failure rate
for a single disc a failure rate is
really how many failures do we expect
for a single working this to have in a
second obviously this number will be
extremely small usually we can assume
that the failure rate is constant over
time that is every second if the disc is
working at the beginning of the second
it has the same failure rate during that
second for a single disc then the MTTF
the mean time to failure will be 1 over
F so for example if the disc has one
millionth of a failure per second then
the MTTF will be 1 million seconds four
discs the MTTF is also sometimes called
mean time to data loss or how long until
we lose some date on this disc and for a
single disc the meantime to data loss is
the same as the MTTF of one disc now
let's look at what happens when we have
end such discs in a raid 0 configuration
it turns out that the failure rate when
we have n working disks is equal to n
times the failure rate of one disc this
is because for example if we can expect
one millionth of a failure / working
disk per second then we can expect one
failure per million working disks per
second so if we start the second with a
million working disks chances are that
one of them will fail during the second
if we start the second with half a
million working disks on average half of
what single disc will fail per second
and so on it also turns out that the
mean time to the first failure among n
working disks has the same distribution
as the first failure for the single disc
so we get the MTTF for n disks in raid 0
configuration where MTTF is really the
meantime to data loss in this case
is equal to the MTTF of one disc divided
by n so if you have two discs the MTTF
of the raid 0 array with two discs will
be half of the FTT f of a single disc a
single disc typical will have the MTTF
on the order of 10 ish years to maybe a
hundred years so if we have too many
disks in raid 0 configuration we can
reduce the MTTF so the average disc will
not fail in the five or six years that
we actually end up using it but if we
have two or three or four such discs
then we can expect the array to fail at
least once until we actually get rid of
it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
