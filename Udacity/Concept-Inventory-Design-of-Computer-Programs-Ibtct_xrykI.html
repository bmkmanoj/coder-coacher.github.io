any of these see if there's any
difficulties any areas that we think
might be hard to implement so the board
can be some kind of two-dimensional
array maybe a list of lists is one
possibility and one thing I'm not quite
clear on now is do I need one board or
two it's clear I need one board to hold
all the letters but then there's also
these onus squares should that be part
of the same bored or should that be a
separate board you know and the letters
are layered on top of this background
bonus squares I'm not quite sure yet but
I'm not too worried about it because I
can make either approach work a letter
can be one character string a word can
be a string a hand can also be a string
it could also be a list of letters
either one would be fine so any
collection of letters would be ok note
that a set would not work for the hand
this the hand can't be a set of letters
because we might have duplicates and
sets don't allow duplicates now for the
notion of the logo of a legal play we'll
have some function that generates legal
plays given a board position and a hand
and then the plays himself will need
some representation maybe they can be
something like a tuple of SE starting
position so for example ritzy starts in
this location the direction in which
they're going are they going across or
down are the two allowable directions
the word itself in this case ritzy so
that seems like a good representation
for a legal play not quite sure yet what
the representation of a position or a
direction should be but that's easy
enough a score will have some function
to compute the score for letters we can
have a dictionary that says the value of
Z is 10 and 4 plays will need some
function to compute that and for the
bonus squares will need some mapping
from a position on the board to double
word or triple letter or whatever a
dictionary is a set of words the blank
letter well we said letters were strings
so that's probably ok you know we could
use the string space or the string under
bar
present the blank and then it's dealing
with it what that will be an issue later
on now I'm a little bit worried about
blanks because in poker Joker's were
easy we just said replace them by any
car and just deal with all the
possibilities and our routines are fast
enough that we can probably deal with
them all here I'm pretty confident we
can make it fast enough that that
approach will work but it doesn't quite
work because not only do we have to try
all possibilities for the letters but
the scoring rules are actually different
so when you use a blank instead of a
letter you don't get the letter scores
for that blank and so I'll have to have
scoring know about blanks and not just
know about filling things in so that'll
be a complication but overall I went
through all the concepts I've got an
implementation for both some of them are
functions that I don't quite know how to
do but I don't see anything that looks
like a showstopper so I think I can go
ahead and the difficulty then is not
that I have to invent something new in
order to solve one of the problems the
difficulty is just that there's so much
when faced with the problem of this size
or problems can be much longer much
larger the notion of pacing is an
important one what do I mean by that it
means I want to attack this and i know
i'm not going to solve it all at once
I'm not just going to sit down for 20
minutes and knock out the whole problem
it's going to be a lot longer than that
so I want to have pacing in that I have
sort of intermediate goals along the way
where I can say okay now I'm going to
focus on one part of the problem and I'm
going to get that done and then when I'm
done with that part then I can move on
to the next part if you don't have that
pacing you can lose your focus you can
get discouraged that there's so much
left to do but if you break it up into
bite-sized pieces then you can say okay
I'm almost there I just have to finish a
little bit more and now this piece will
be done and then I can move on to the
next piece so the first piece I'm going
to look at is finding words from a hand
in other words i'm going to ignore the
whole board i'm going to say pretend the
board isn't there and pretend all we
have is the hand and we have the
dictionary a set of legal words and i
want to know out of that hand what words
in the dictionary can i make</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
