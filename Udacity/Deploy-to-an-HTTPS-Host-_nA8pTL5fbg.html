tampering with the communication between
your progressive web app and your users
browser it's also a strict requirement
to use service workers your app must be
served over HTTPS in order to register a
service worker and many older ap is that
may reveal sensitive data are being
updated to require HTTPS such as the
geolocation API and get user media for
deploying your weather app there are a
number of options you can add HTTPS to
your own server there's a great source
for free certificates in the instructor
notes or you can use one of the hosting
providers that offer HTTPS by default
github pages and firebase both support
static hosting over HTTPS and the Google
cloud platform offers App Engine which
can support HTTPS and is useful if you
need any back-end logic one thing I
really like about firebase is hosting is
that it redirects all requests to https
even if a user types in HTTP colon
forward slash forward slash it will
automatically redirect to the secure URL
let's walk through the steps to deploy a
firebase I've already created my account
and added a new project and I've already
installed the firebase command line
tools if you haven't worked with
firebase before check out the link to
the hosting dots in the instructor notes
for a quick getting started guide first
I need to authenticate to the firebase
command line tool using firebase log in
next I need to initialize my firebase
app by running firebase in it I'll give
it the app name that it should deploy to
the directory I want it to upload and so
forth finally I can run firebase deploy
and it'll upload everything to firebase
let's give it a try if you haven't
worked with firebase before check the
link to the hosting dogs and the
instructor notes for a quick getting
started guide first I need to
authenticate the firebase
and line using firebase login great
success next I need to initialize my
firebase up by running firebase in it
I'll give it the name of the app it
should use the directory I want it to
upload and so forth finally I can run
firebase deploy and it'll upload
everything let's give it a try looks
perfect perfect seems like everything
worked exactly as I expect</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
