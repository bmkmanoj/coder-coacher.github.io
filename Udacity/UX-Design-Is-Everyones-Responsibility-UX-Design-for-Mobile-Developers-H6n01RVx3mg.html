we showed you guys the example of a
Porsche to illustrate you good user
experience design it's because we want
to explain that good user experience
should make your users happy it should
make you happy that's kind of the whole
point and UX design is about all of
these tons of different things coming
together so if every person that made
the Porsche
if anyone dropped the ball the UX of the
Porsche wouldn't be awesome it's all
these things coming together that really
makes user experience design because
design is everyone's responsibility no
exactly and I think one of the important
things for for us as developers to
remember is that all the things that
made that Porsche amazing can actually
port it directly into the software world
so let's bring it from the Porsche world
into the software world now when we're
in the software world as developers we
think in terms of code so let's look at
all the code that we write as something
that goes in this box and let's say that
all the code contributes to what's
called the user experience off a
particular application so now if you
take a little bit closer to look at the
chunks of code that we write let's say
that you have code that essentially puts
pixels on a screen or interacts with the
user in any way this could be through
audio input or audio output let's say
that that is your UI code that's it the
rest of the code that you write stuff
for your back-end and so on the non
visual code that actually does not have
an impact on the UI but it does have a
direct and strong impact on the UX and
that's something that we should always
keep in mind so this is basically the
difference between UI and UX they're not
synonyms but they get thrown around a
lot so I think it's important to kind of
disambiguate these two terms yeah
exactly the visual and non-visual code
come together to deliver the user
experience for your application whereas
the visual code almost exclusively
delivers to user interface but the most
important thing is that the overall UX
should make your users feel happy yeah
so think about an application that's
made you happy what has blown your mind
by delivering an awesome user experience
keep that app in mind because we're
going to be using that later on this
