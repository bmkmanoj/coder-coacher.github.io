this test case that we've already talked
about is it possible that I can conclude
without trying it but this test case
will succeed and what this test case
does is in q7 sleeps for a while
DQ's an element and in checks if it was
seven and the answer again is yes and
again it depends on making an argument
about the actual form of the code for
our q and so if you recall that code the
code didn't contain any dependencies on
the time at which Q requests arrived
just to be clear we're trying to make
arguments that a single test case is
representative of a whole class of
actual executions of the system that
we're testing and in the general case we
can't make those arguments we can only
make these arguments for the specific Q
code that we're talking about because we
know that for example it doesn't depend
on the integer value that we're adding
it doesn't depend on the time at which
operations are made and that's why these
arguments actually work and so we're
actually getting at here is a fairly
deep idea and the idea is you have a
single test case represents a point in
the input space for the system that
we're testing by running the code we map
that point in the input space to a
single point in the output space but the
problem is there's a extremely large
input space and we can't test at all and
so we're trying to do here is build up
an intuition for when we can make an
argument that in fact we haven't made an
argument about the mapping of a single
input to a single output but rather some
class of inputs that are closely related
that are somehow equivalent for purposes
of the system under test and that if the
system executes correctly for the single
input that we've tried that's going to
execute correctly for all of the inputs
in this particular little bit of the
input space let's look at a few ways in
which the arguments that we've made here
could have gone wrong so is it ever the
case that our Q could work for some
integer but not work for general
integers and certainly it is the case
for example if the Python runtime
contains some sort of a bug where large
integers were truncated that it would
obviously be the case that if we put one
of those large integers into our Q it
would get truncated somewhere in the Q
processing here and what would come out
wouldn't be what we had tried to put in
similarly if the Python runtime contains
some sort of a garbage collection bug
the corrupted heap memory it might be
the case that sleeping would give the PI
on interpreter time to corrupt our value
time to corrupt our cue and we wouldn't
get something out but in both of these
cases here we're making arguments about
the broader runtime system and not the
actual code under test and remember that
the arguments that we made here really
only applied they're really only about
the actual code that we were testing so
in summary we can make these kind of
arguments but we have to be extremely
careful that the assumptions that those
arguments are based on are good ones
what I'd like to do now is give you a
little quiz about these concepts</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
