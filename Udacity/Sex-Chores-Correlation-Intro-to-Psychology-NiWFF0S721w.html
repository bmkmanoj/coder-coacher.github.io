misrepresents studies for example here
are some recent headlines based on a
real scientific study husbands who do
more housework may have less sex want to
have more sex men stop doing chores men
not doing chores having a lot of sex
these media headlines are based on a
correlational study that measured the
time and type of chores masculine versus
feminine and the amount of sexual
encounters in this study they found that
couples who split the type of household
chore masculine versus feminine reported
five sexual encounters per month however
when men completed approximately 17
hours of masculine type chores and women
completed approximately 35 hours of
feminine type chores they had nearly two
more sexual encounters per month chores
or types of chores masculine versus
feminine and sexual encounters in this
example a variable is any characteristic
that can vary across individuals or
across time within the same individuals
and this is a correlational study
because we are not manipulating any
variables instead we are just simply
observing a mathematical relationship
between two variables in this case
chores the number and type masculine
versus feminine and the amount of sexual
encounters an important distinction in
correlational studies is that they do
not manipulate any variables instead
we're just measuring to see whether the
variables are related this differs from
experimental studies or in researchers
actually manipulate an independent
variable and measure the effect on the
dependent variable we will cover these
types of studies after looking at
correlations</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
