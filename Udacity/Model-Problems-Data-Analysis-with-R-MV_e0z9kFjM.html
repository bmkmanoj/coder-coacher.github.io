here and if you have any ideas that I
don't mention please share them in the
form to start our doubters from 2008 so
not only do we need to account for
inflation but the diamond market is
quite different now than it was in fact
when I fit models to this data and
predicted the price of diamonds that I
found at the market I kept getting
predictions that were way too low after
some additional digging I found the
global diamonds report it turns out that
prices plummeted in 2008 due to the
global financial crisis and since then
prices at least for wholesale polished
diamonds have grown at about six percent
per year compound annual rate the
rapidly growing number of couples in
China buying diamond engagement rings
might also explain this increase you can
click on the links in the instructor
notes to learn more about that and
finally after looking at the data on
price scope I realized that diamond
prices grew unevenly across different
carat sizes since 2008 meaning that the
model I initially estimated couldn't
simply be adjusted by inflation</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
