visual of why the distributive property
works the way that it works so let's go
back to drawing our beautiful circles so
let's say we have a group of two circles
and also a group of ten circles and
according to this equation what we're
going to want to do is both add them
together and then triple them so if we
were to solve this problem the first way
that we talked about they would do this
addition inside the parentheses first
and then our multiplication so we would
take these two groups the two and the 10
circles and merge them into one group
great so now we have 12 circles in one
big group and then the next thing we
want to do is multiply this group by 3
so that means we want three sets of this
group of circles so right now we have
one set and I can add one more which
makes two sets and that I can add a
third one remember multiplication is
just repeated addition so now i have
three groups of these twelve circles
together and that's it I can count these
up and if i decide you that right now
which I won't because I'm lazy we would
see that we have 36 circles okay great
so that's the first method for solving
this problem however we also have that
second method of solving problems like
this and that's using the distributive
property so if we want to use the
distributive property then the first
step is going to be to multiply each of
the terms that's inside the parentheses
by the three so let's write down method
to first we're going to say three times
two and then we're going to add that to
three times ten just like we saw in the
last quiz starting with a group of two
circles I want to triple this like we
see in this first term and then as we
see in the second term I want to triple
this group as well great so now I have
two groups one group of six circles
which is three times two and one group
of thirty circles which is three times
ten and then I want to add those two
groups together so we need to merge the
set of circles with this set of circles
and we end up with the exact same
picture that we got using the first
method once again we have 36 circles all
in one group I hope this has given you
some insight into why we're allowed to
distribute multiplication to terms that
are added together inside parentheses</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
