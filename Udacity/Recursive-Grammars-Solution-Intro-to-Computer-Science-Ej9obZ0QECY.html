if the given grammar generates
infinitely many strings starting from
the non-terminal word so we can start
from either substitution rule if we
start from the first one then we end up
with one possible word if we start from
the second word then we get the letter A
and then we can insert another word this
can be Udacity so then we end up with
you audacity we can do the same thing
but twice so we have a then instead of
going the Udacity we do a again and then
we do you dasa T and the way this is
breaking down kind of looks like this
and it should be pretty clear that we
can can you continue this forever and
eventually end with Udacity so we can
have an arbitrary number of a is
followed by Udacity this indicates that
this grammar generates an infinite
number of possible words in this grammar
we can see that every word begins with a
root and then a tail so what we're going
to do to see how many strings this
generates is go through every possible
route there can be and then every tale
there can be so a root can be udah and
also boda tail can go directly to CS and
city but we should also look at this
substitution rule that has root going
directly to tail so you could have a
word that's really the same as tail tail
which adds two more possible
combinations to what group can be this
gives us four possibilities for root and
two possibilities for tail which means
eight possibilities all together this
grammar can generate eight different
words we know that 8 is less than
infinity so this grammar does not
generate an infinite number of words so
here we have a grammar that looks a lot
like our first one however it would
still work it out to see if there's an
infinite number of words so according to
problem we start with word and there's
only one substitution roll forward from
predaceous we have two options we could
go to super you Dacia's which gives us
one complete word or we can do pre-super
you dashes and you might have already
noticed that we can keep substituting
the pre with pre-super
we can keep doing this forever and
stopping at any point and ending with
some number of supers followed by you
Dacia's this grammar generates an
infinite number of strengths</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
