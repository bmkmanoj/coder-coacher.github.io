so we're gonna make a procedure using
death it takes one input we'll use the
name n for our input that's the number
that we go up to now to do the loop we
need to have a new variable that keeps
track of the loop iterations
we'll use I for that and we start with
one that's the first number to print out
we need the loop now so we have the
while and the test that we want is we
want to keep going up to and including
the number n so we want to print the
numbers all the way from 1 up to and
including n so our test will now be a
less than or equal to test we want to
keep going as long as I is less than or
equal to n once I gets bigger than n
that's when we should stop what we do in
loop body is print the value of I and
add 1 to I we don't need to return
anything the only point of the procedure
as we were asked to write it was to
print out the numbers so now let's do a
test we'll print the numbers up to 3 and
there we get the output printing the
numbers 1 2 3 there are lots of other
ways we could have written this another
approach would be to start with I equals
0 make the test condition I is less than
n so now we're stopping as soon as I is
equal to n for this to print out the
correct numbers though now we need to
move the print we want to print to be
after we added 1 to I so the first
number we print is supposed to be a 1
which will be the case here and the
final number we print should be n which
is the case here once the value of I is
n this test will be false and we don't
go through the loop anymore so when we
run this we get the same result printing
1 2 3 so as another test let's see what
happens when we pass in 0 and when we
run this it doesn't print anything and
that's because when I is 0 I less than n
evaluates to false 0 is not less than 0
so we don't go through the loop at all
and don't print anything which seems
like a pretty sensible thing since we
said print the numbers between 1 and the
target number if the target number is 0
not putting anything sort of makes sense</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
