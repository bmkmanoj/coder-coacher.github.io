between cooperating and defecting in
this first column it's minus one versus
zero right which number is bigger zero
right if I look at it in this column
it's minus nine or minus six which
number is bigger negative six right in
both cases defecting is better than
cooperating so in fact this choice this
strategy dominates the other in other
words it is always better for me to
defect than cooperate so I will never
cooperate ever because it's always
better for me to defect so fine so I'll
never cooperate ever that'll show you by
exactly the same argument minus one
versus zero minus nine versus minus six
defecting is always better B will never
cooperate what's the only thing that's
left pane pane this is called the
prisoner's dilemma huh you said it was
simple but it seems kind of evil I
didn't say it wasn't even those things
are an opposite of one another it's not
like perfect versus hidden or pure
versus mixed it's not easy versus evil
evil is often actually easier it's easy
and evil so we're in a little depressing
place here Michael you claimed in the
beginning and I agreed with you that
this is sort of the best option you want
everyone to cooperate because that's
sort of what's best for the group but
because defecting dominates cooperating
both for a and B you're going to end up
here at least if you reason about it
that way yeah I see that
hence prisoner's dilemma the only way to
break this is if somehow we could
communicate and collude with one another
so that we could guarantee that we would
both choose to cooperate at the same
time so that's that that wall what if
you put us like a Skype connection
between it or a Google hangout well if
you were forced to say what you're gonna
say at the same time or somehow be able
to punish someone maybe for you know not
doing the right thing then you might be
able to make a different decision but
for this very simple version where I'm
going to do it once even if I could hear
what you had to say if one of us
whichever one of us went first the
second one would always be able to take
advantage of that I do find this kind of
depressing yes
it's a dilemma it's a true dilemma so
this brings us to a more general sort of
strategy this whole notion of strict
dominance works in this case but you can
imagine very complicated large matrices
where it may not work but it turns out
there's a generalization of this notion
of dominance that works remarkably well
and that's what people tend to use to
try to solve these kinds of games to
find out what the true value of a game
is so let me describe that for you okay
okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
