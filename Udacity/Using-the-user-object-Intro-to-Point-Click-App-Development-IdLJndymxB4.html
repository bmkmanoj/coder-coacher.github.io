right yep the quick access menu used in
min a while it's nice okay a new field
exactly because the object already
exists it's a relationship it's a
relationship and it's going to be a
lookup and mainly because you can't
actually do a master-detail to a user
object that's just one of the
requirements and salesforce but also we
already have all of those records
created so we couldn't even do a master
detail if we wanted to ok so it's
related to user right and of course the
next ritual so we want to change that to
say stage manager instead of user ok
that makes sense ok so we've added our
user field right there yeah sweet stage
manager look up to the user great so
let's go back to the Udacity stage and
make you the manager yeah ok Udacity
stage so there's the stage manager field
you can just double-click it ok so i can
double click here use my magnifying
glass friend sweet and it already knows
i'm a user that's that's creepy Sam I
don't like when sales for screws to me
how do I know that well you're the
logged in user right now and you're the
only user in your organization because
you just created it today ok and I don't
have a role but presumably I could ok
safe yep and we even could have created
a filter to only show people by certain
roles to show up in this look up cool ok
so we've done it great managing stages
you're the manager of the stages now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
