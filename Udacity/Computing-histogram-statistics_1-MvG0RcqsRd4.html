deviation we call the function mean and
STD on our data frame to get the values
let's go ahead and check the mean and
the standard deviation for the daily
returns of the s py stock so we get the
mean and the standard deviation happy
with just knowing the mean and standard
deviation value but I am NOT I want to
see it on the plot just like professor
did so let's learn how to add mean and
standard deviation line on plotter
matplotlib library has a function ax V
line looking at the substring V line we
can guess it will give vertical line
let's check out its parameters first we
pass the mean value then just for
beautification and so that we can
differentiate the mean line from the
rest histogram we add a color which is
white make it a dash style line and
increase the line width to two now let's
check our output so this is a mean and
this is how it is plotted on the
histogram now let's go ahead and plot
standard deviation to plot the standard
deviation line it is similar to the mean
but as we want the standard deviation
line on both side of the mean we plot it
twice one with the positive value and
one with the negative value to show
standard deviation line on either side
of the mean tada
we have a standard deviation lines on
our graph to give the standard deviation
a red color I have just replaced the
parameter color of white with red now
I'm happy with the graph and I hope you
two are let's move ahead to kurtosis we
can expect that data frame would have a
function for calculating kurtosis as
well so that's it
this line will give you ketosis of the
daily returns we get a positive value
for the s py stock which means we have
fat tails just for your information you
can also get bin counts using numpy dot
histogram function check instructors
notes for more information over to you
