this time we're going to start sort of
on some of the small technical details
of doing recognition I remember we said
that recognition is mostly going to be
some form of a classification problem
and we're going to look at some methods
and some representations so today we're
going to start with what we talked about
supervised classification in fact almost
everything we're going to do is going to
be in the supervised domain so in the
supervised world basically I give you a
set of labeled training examples and the
goal is to come up with some function
that if you give it a new example it'll
generate the correct label so using the
handwritten digit recognition as a
example so here we have some training
examples right we've got a bunch of
fours and a bunch of nines and you'll
notice they're not it's not trivial
right because these these fours you know
could have been a nine but no they're
actually fours so what I want to do is I
want to come up with a function such
that if I give it some novel input I
give it something looks like this it's
gonna say what is it gonna say four or
99 very good very nine meg has been
paying attention</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
