debugger caught inside the plot points
callback function which gets called
after our data gets loaded there
represents our attendance data for all
the games and just as a sanity check if
we use the console that table function
to display the first 10 rows of our data
set you can see here that it looks the
same even though some of the columns are
smushed but we have a game ID attendance
team one team two goals tie and so forth
so it appears our data is loaded
correctly stepping once more through to
the key function if we inspect what D is
we can see here that it's game ID 1
which represents the first game italy vs
the US and so forth with all the other
data of our first row if we call the get
UTC full-year function on our date
object we can see here there are turns
correctly 1934 stepping through to our
roll-up function we can see here that
leaves represents an array and here we
can see there's an array of 17 objects
if we inspect each of these we can see
that as one game in this case from the
tournament in 1934 the second one is
another game from the year nineteen
thirty-four so what gets passed to the
roll-up is one group at a time of the
grouping specified in the key function
and it is the job of the roll-up
function to distill in this case the 17
objects or games into a single value or
a single aggregate going back to our
editor to fix up our roll-up aggregate
function we need three things from each
of these groups the first of which is
the sum of all the games attendances for
a given year the second is the longitude
of where to draw the circle on our map
and the third is the latitude of water
draw this to get the sum of the
attendances we'll be using the d3 some
method which takes bow
some array or list lick object in our
case leaves and an accessor function
that defines what to actually some</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
