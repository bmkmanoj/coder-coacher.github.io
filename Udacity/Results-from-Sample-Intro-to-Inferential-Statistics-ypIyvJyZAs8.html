intervals for this now we don't know the
results yet because I'm just giving you
this poll but let's pretend that we get
an average of seven point five for how
engaged you are and an average of eight
point two for how much you think you're
learning so these are hypothetical
population parameters mu sub e for
engagement and use of L for learning
let's say The Associated standard
deviations are point six four and point
seven three now let's say our
distributions look like this for each
measure so they're negatively skewed and
let's say I want to get these means up
I'm going to try to do this by writing a
song about the concepts in the next
lesson and then singing it maybe it'll
help you stay engaged because hearing a
song can be entertaining maybe it'll
help you learn because hearing a song
can help you remember the concept and
what it is however I'm not totally sure
at this point that it might actually
help rather than hurt your learning so
instead of giving everybody this lesson
without a clue as to whether or not it's
going to help I'm just going to give
this lesson to a random sample of twenty
students then I have them anonymously
take the same poll you just did let's
say we get the following sample means</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
