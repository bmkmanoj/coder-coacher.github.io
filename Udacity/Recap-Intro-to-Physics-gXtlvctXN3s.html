learned last time while we talked about
Aristotle and Galileo and they each had
different thoughts on how objects move
when they're in freefall remember
Aristotle thought that the velocity of
an object is proportional to its mass
and then it falls with constant velocity
Galileo thought that the distance and
object covers is proportional to the
square of the time it's been falling or
in the case of experiments rolling in
order to distinguish between these two
viewpoints we had to do an experiment
and we found out that data is really
power in physics and how did we
distinguish between these two viewpoints
we did an experiment because in the
world of science evidence rules not the
ideas of brilliant thinkers we also
learned some of the equations of motion
for example the equation which describes
how far an object travels in a certain
time given an initial velocity and an
acceleration so all of these together
gave us the ability to predict how an
object will move or to quantify its
motion the goal for this unit is to
explain the cause of motion we already
know how to quantify and predict an
object's motion but we still don't know
why an object is moving the way it is to
do this we have to understand what it
means for an object to be at rest seems
like a straightforward concept but
actually a lot to learn here we'll also
have to learn Newton's three laws of
motion and these are the same laws of
motion that you can use to send a rocket
into space or put a person on the moon
will also be able to answer the feather
problem by the end of this unit and
what's the feather problem well one
problem with feathers is that they're
very hard to draw so I apologize but the
problem I'm referring to is that when
you drop a feather it actually does fall
it more or less constant speed which
seems to align with Aristotle's view
point so we need to figure out what's
going on there finally we'll learn about
gravity and I'll teach you how you can
use your physics knowledge to lift
enormous objects before we get started
let's go to Cambridge University in
England and talk to dr. Patricia Farah
who's an expert in Isaac Newton and his
book the principia mathematica Isaac
Newton symbolizes two great changes in
the way that science was done in
particular in the way that physics was
done he didn't do this single-handedly
he was just one of many people who did
it particularly Galileo so there's two
main reasons why his book the Principia
the mathematical principles of natural
philosophy why it's important</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
