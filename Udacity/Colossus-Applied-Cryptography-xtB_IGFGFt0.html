do this was called the Heath Robinson it
was named after this British cartoonist
who drew cartoons of crazy machines to
do operations this one was for peeling
potatoes and the timeline of this is
quite interesting so the first operator
mistake the retransmission with
abbreviations happened in August 1941
that was intercepted over the next year
that was enough to learn from the two
intercepted messages the structure of
the machine then to understand it well
enough to develop this technique the
double Delta technique for finding the
correct configuration and to break
messages by December 1942 they decided
to build a machine and put the resources
necessary to design and build the
machine it was requested to be done by
June of 1943 it was actually delivered
three months early by April 1943 they
had the first machine delivered and
operational and it could process
messages about 2,000 characters per
second so it was able to do seven XOR
operations in half a millisecond running
this paper taped through at twenty
kilometres per hour this was not quite
fast enough a lot of the value in
decrypting messages especially in
wartime is being able to decrypt them
before what the message is describing
actually happened so they built a faster
machine and the faster machine was
called Colossus this was operational by
January 1944 and the big change that
made Colossus much faster and more
useful than the heath robinson machines
was that they replaced the
configurations which were previously on
a tape with an electronic key text
generator the logic is doing all the xor
x' and Counting the number that are zero
and then it's printing out those tallies
so you can go back and find the right
configuration and the ciphertext is
still on a paper tape this is spinning
through about 50 kilometers an hour it's
a pretty impressive sight when it was
operating processing 5,000 characters
per second and what made this arguably
the first computer was because of the
electronic key Tex this logic was a
little bit programmable it didn't do
always exactly the same thing there were
ways to program it to do slightly
different operations depending on what
the analysts thought was the most you
whole thing to deal with that
intercepted cipher texts so this was
arguably the first programmable digital
electronic computer it wasn't fully
programmable it wasn't a general-purpose
computer but it could be programmed to
change its behavior slightly you can see
what this looks like during World War
two there very few pictures of it this
was a very secretive operation and the
machines were actually all destroyed
after the war a lot of the value in
breaking a cipher is to make sure that
no one else knows that you've broken it
this is different from academic
cryptography where people like to
publicize when they break ciphers in
military cryptography the whole value of
breaking a cipher is that your enemy
keeps using it so you want to keep it
very secretive that you've done that a
lot of the work on Colossus was not
Declassified until the mid 90s today if
you visit Bletchley Park you can see a
replica a rebuilt version of Colossus
this is my picture of it from 2004 does
look very similar to the black-and-white
picture from World War 2 unfortunately
they don't operate it frequently so you
won't get to see the tape spinning
through at 50 kilometers an hour and all
the crunching going on unless you're
very lucky to go one of the few few days
a year that they might actually operate
so these Colossus machines had a huge
impact on the world war 2 by the end of
the war there were ten of them
continuously operating at Bletchley Park
decrypting all the traffic that they
could intercept they decoded over 63
million letters of messages in access
communications among the things they
learn from them were the troop locations
of access sudden d-day this was very
helpful for planning the operation so
why did I tell you this story well first
of all it is an important story in the
history of both the world as well as
computing but this isn't meant to be a
history class although I certainly like
to have historical excursions when I can
but it's also very relevant to modern
crypt analysis modern ciphers are much
better than the Lorenz cipher and the
main reason for that is we can use
computing power to do the encryption but
the basic ideas are actually quite
similar so the goal of the cipher is to
hide all the statistical properties that
are inherent in the message and they're
present in the key at least the
generated key that
actual key we hope is perfectly random
finding perfect randomness and getting
it in computing is quite challenging but
let's assume we have a perfectly random
key what we learned from the perfect
cipher analysis is that the key must be
shorter than the message that means in
order for the cipher to work we need to
generate more key bits than we actually
have and so even if the original key and
you can think of that in the case of
colossus is the configuration of the
machine that comes from some code book
that could be perfectly randomly
generated and shared between the
endpoints that is only the starting
configuration there's some larger key
that has to be generated to produce the
cipher text and so both the key and the
message have some statistical properties
the goal of the ciphers to hide all
those properties the goal of the analyst
is to find statistical properties in the
ciphertext and then to use those to
break the key or the message in the case
of Bletchley Park breaking the Lorenz
cipher
they found that Cystic alert ease when
you looked across channels at subsequent
letters there were some statistical
properties that were not hidden by the
cipher and that was because of a
mechanical weakness that all the s
wheels either all moved or didn't move
and that meant that instead of having
the long period with no repetition of 19
million letters that the users of the
Lorenz machine thought it had the Allies
could break that down and find a pattern
that was only 1271 letters long with
much fewer configurations to try to have
a good guess if the cipher with many
fewer guesses needed in a modern cipher
we think of that as a mathematical
weakness there's some problem in the
mathematics of the cipher that leaves
some statistical property that a crypt
analyst could exploit the other
relevance to modern crypt analysis is
it's really lots of hard work to do that
I find it quite amazing what Bletchley
Park was able to do with Colossus it
still took six months of effort looking
at those two messages to figure out the
key and interpret the key structure from
that that requires an awful lot of trial
and error and
a lot of creativity but also a lot of
tedious work in modern analysis we try
to do as much of the tedious work as
possible by computers but there's still
lots of hard work that goes into
breaking a cipher and motivation
certainly helps a lot for that in the
case of watch Li Park the fear that your
country was under attack is a pretty
strong motivation</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
