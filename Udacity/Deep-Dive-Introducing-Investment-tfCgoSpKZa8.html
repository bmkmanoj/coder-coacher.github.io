to consider investment for your business
let's look at what investing is then go
over some of the benefits and downsides
of choosing this option for your startup
first what is investing investing is the
process of putting money into something
in hope of financial or material gain so
when you're looking for investors you'll
be dealing with people who want to give
you money upfront in exchange for later
returns on this initial investment the
motivations of each individual investor
may vary but keeping their incentives in
mind will help you better understand the
benefits and downsides of dealing with
investors so why might you consider
working with these investors let's
overview three of them funding context
and motivation first funding an obvious
benefit of dealing with investors is
that they have money available to help
you jump-start your business with
investment you can expand more quickly
and allocate some of the risk to your
investors next contacts and advice many
investors have groups of other investors
entrepreneurs and advisors they
associate with you can use their
contacts to seek more funding it's in an
investor's best interest to help you get
the resources you need and the right
investor will be able to provide them
and finally motivation an investment is
in some ways like a marriage if you
marry the wrong person working with them
will be miserable and they may end up
sinking the business but finding the
right investor means both monetary
investment and personal investment
they'll be there through many of the
obstacles you face and will give a
second set of eyes on what you're
spending your money on if having someone
else around helps provide the motivation
you need then an investor can be a great
asset to your company so those are some
of the benefits of working with
investors but what are some of the
downsides let's look at three rate of
return communication and control first
rate of return above all else investors
are trying to make money and they expect
a higher rate of return than what
traditional investments can provide what
is important to an investor is how your
plan ends up with more money in their
pockets it can be difficult to balance
this pressure from investors with your
original vision because of this you'll
end up needing to communicate your
decisions with investors you'll spend
more time explaining your ideas
and dealing with the political aspects
of your company and finally control
sometimes the decisions you make won't
be well accepted and can even scare away
potential investors even though it is
your company once an investor is
involved you've given up some of the
control you had over the direction you
take does reaching out to an investor
seem like a good option to you take some
time to consider each of the benefits
and downsides of working with investors
for your startup</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
