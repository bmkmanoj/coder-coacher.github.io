will cover the basics of get so for
example how to introduce yourself to get
how to create a repository how to commit
changes and get changes from the
repository and so on so after you
install Gita you should have the get
tool available on the command line so
you can run the command get and if you
just execute gate you will get the usage
information forget with the most
commonly used git commands and to find
information on any command you can
simply type get help in the name of the
command for example let's try to write
get help in it and that brings up the
get manual page for git init which
describes the command the synopsis and
so on now let's get started with using
it by introducing ourselves to get it
which is the first thing we need to do
to do that we use the git config command
in particular we're going to write a git
config - - global username which means
that we are telling it our username
we'll specify our username which in this
case is George P Burdell
and you can also provide your email
address in the same way so you still use
the git config - - global command but in
this case you will write user dot email
as the property and then you'll specify
a suitable email address in this case
the email address of George P Burdell we
will now look at some commonly used
commands that to create and maintain a
local repository let's first create a
new project and call it my project so to
do that we are simply going to create a
directory then we're going to move into
that directory now if we try to call the
git status command at this point to see
what the state of my project of course
git doesn't know anything about this
project right so you will get an error
it will tell you that basically we are
not in a git repository so how do we
create a git repos well do we make this
a git repository what we do it by
calling get in it and the output will
tell you that the reporter was
initialized if we check the status again
you will see that now it recognizes the
repository and will tell you that
there's nothing to commit because of
course the repository is completely
empty so let's just create a new empty
file which we're going to call them
readme so now if you run git status as
you can see git will tell you that there
is a file is called readme but it's
untracked
now
that means is that the file is not
staged if you remember our lesson so
what we need to do we first need to tell
git that you know this file needs to be
considered and the way we do that is by
calling the git add command and then we
specify with me as the argument for the
command if we call again git status now
as you can see it knows that there is a
new file called readme because the file
is staged so git is aware of the fact
that this file has to be committed so to
commit the file we simply execute git
commit which will open a text editor
which can be different depending on what
is your environment and here we need to
add a comment to be added to the commit
so here we simply write in added readme
file then we can close and save and this
will add the file to the git repository
the local git repository of course so at
this point if we run git status again to
see where we are you can see that gate
tells you that there is nothing to
commit because of course the only file
that we have is committed to the
repository now let's make some changes
to our readme file I'm just going to add
some text here once more we can run git
status and at this point get knows about
this file so you will know that readme
file has been modified remember that
before he was telling you it was a new
file now it knows that there is a
different version in the repository so
something we can do at this point for
example is to check the differences
between this file and the committed one
by executing git diff readme and if you
look at the output of the git diff
command here you can see that this line
readme file content was added and you
will see that it's added because there
is a plus sign before that line in case
of deletion of lines you will see a
minus sign there so at this point if we
want to commit our file remember they
will always have to tell git that we
want to stage the file before committing
it otherwise it will be ignored by the
committee operation so to tailgate that
this file has to be staged we can use
the usual git add commander but if you
remember the lesson we can also use a
shortcut so you we don't really have to
do this in two steps we can simply say
git commit minus a and this will tell
gate to commit all of the files that get
knows about which in this case is only
the readme file of course something else
that we can do is that we can also
provide the right away a message for the
commit without having to open an editor
so to do that we can specify the -
option and at this point we can just put
in double quotes our content we press
ENTER and as you can see it will notify
us that one file was changed at any
particular also tell you that there was
an insertion again if we run git status
you will see that there is nothing else
to commit so now let's imagine that you
want to see the version history for your
repository you can do that by running
the gate log command so if you run that
it will show you all the different
commits for your repository and each
committees got a commit ID as you can
see here and the one done down here is
the first commit whereas the one above
is this second commit and as you can see
will also show you the comments
associated with each commit and in case
you wanted to see the changes introduced
by a commit you can use the git show
command and you can provide the commit
ID for the commit that you're interested
in and you don't really need to provide
the whole ID you can provide the first
four or more characters so that's what
we're going to do here so we're going to
specify the second commit and when we
execute the command you will show us
that changes introduced by that commit
to fetch a repository from a remote
server you can use the git clone command
so you will write git clone and then
specify the URL for the remote
repository here we're using the SSH
protocol and there's no different other
protocols that can be used so the remote
repository can be made available in
different ways as you can see when you
clone the project the project is cloned
into the local directory and if you
wanted to import the project under a
different name
you could just specify the name that you
want for the local directory for example
in this case my project - and so here we
will get the project in my local
workspace with the name that I specified
so let's go inside one of this two
projects that have the same content
because they're coming from the same
repository if you want to see the
details of the server you can use the
git remote command and specify the flag
- V and here we'll show you what is the
remote repository now let's go ahead and
make some changes to the project for
example let's add a file so I'm going to
just create this empty file so I'm gonna
call new file I'm going to add it to my
index so that it gets committed later on
and then I'm going to run git commit to
actually commit it to the local
repository and I'm going to specify the
comment
for the commit right away here from the
command line so when I do that the file
gets added to my local repository and if
we want to double check that we can run
a git log and if you look at the last
committee at the top you can see that
it's telling me that the new file was
added to the repository showing the
comment that I added but this is just
for the local repository so I need to
use the git push command to push it to
the remote repository and at this point
when I run that my local changes will be
committed to the remote repository so
now let's go to the other copy of the
project that we created the one under
directory my project - if you remember
this project was linked to the same
remote project but of course if we run
git log here we don't see this latest
changes we made because we didn't
synchronize this local copy with the
remote copy and so we just have these
files readme and file they were there
before so what we need to do is that we
need to pull the changes from the remote
repository using it pull and when we do
that they will actually pull these
changes and therefore create the new
files that we created in the other
directory and if we run git log now you
can see that now we have the new entry
the commit at the top that says that
this new file was added and of course
this is just an example so we had two
copies of the project on the same
machine and for the same user so the
normal usage scenario for this it will
be that each user will have their local
copy but this should have given you the
idea of how git allows you to work on
some local file commit them and push
them to a remote repository and other
users to get your changes do further
changes push them as well and then you
know they will allow you to get their
changes and so on and so forth so really
allows this collaboration between
different users and keeping track of all
the changes made by the different users
so now let's look at some more advanced
concept which are the concept of
branching and merging so what branching
means is basically it is to make a copy
to create a branch of the current
project so that we can work on that copy
independently from the other copy from
the other branch and then we can decide
whether we want to keep both branches or
we want to merge them at some point and
you can of course have multiple branches
not just two and the reason why this is
particularly useful is because in many
cases if you think about the way we
develop software or in general we work
with artifacts we might have the need to
create kind of a separate copy of your
workspace to do some experiments for
example so you want to
change something in the code your
knowledge sure is going to work out you
don't want to touch your main coffee so
that's the perfect application for
branching if you want to do a something
like that you want experiment or do some
unit modification that you're not sure
about you will branch your code you will
do the changes and then if you're happy
with the changes you will merge that
branch with the original one or whereas
if you're not happy with the changes you
will just throw away dead branch so this
is just one possible user branch but
it's one of the main uses of that so now
let's see how that can be done with git
so first of all if you want to see which
branches are currently present in your
project you can simply execute git
branch and in this case you can see that
there's only one branch which is called
master and the star there indicates that
this is our current branch so how do we
create a new branch so we simply run the
command git branch and specify a name
for the new branch for example we call
it new branch to make it very explicit
at this point if we run git branch of
course we will have a new branch but
master will still be our current branch
so if you want to switch to the new
branch we will use the git checkout
command and specify the name of the
branch that we want to become our
current branch so when we run that git
will tell us that we switched to the new
branch and if we run git branch you'll
see that now the star is next to new
branch because that's our current branch
there is a shortcut for these two
commands if you run the command git
checkout specify the minus B flag and
then the name of the new branch it will
do both things at the same time it will
create the new branch called testing in
this case and then we will switch to the
new branch and it will tell you after
executing the command so now if we look
at the git branch output you can see
that there's three branches and we are
currently on the testing branch so now
let's create a new file just call it
test file put some content there save it
we add it and commit it
and as you can see now in this current
branch we have our test file so now
let's switch to a different branch so
let's go back to the master branch using
the usual git checkout command so now if
we do unless if we check the content of
the current directory we can see that
the test file is not there because of
course it's not in this branch so now
let's assume that we are happy with the
test file that we created with the
modification that we made on the branch
and so we want to merge that branch with
our master branch to do that we can call
the gate merge command and we'll specify
the branch that we want to merge with
the current one so we will specify
testing in this case that will merge the
testing branch with the current branch
which is the master which means that now
the test file is in my current working
directory is in my current branch and if
I run git branch you will see that the
testing branch is obviously still there
so let's assume that we want to delete
the testing branch at this point because
we don't need it anymore we could simply
execute git branch minus D which stands
for - delete specify the name of the
branch and this will eliminate that
branch as confirmed by running the
command git branch where the testing
branch no longer shows up so something
that might happen when you merge
branches is that you may have conflicts
for example in case you change the same
file into different branches so let's
see an example of that so we're going to
check which branches we have so we have
two branches in this case master and new
branch our current branch is master
let's open this file called new file and
add some content there so now let's
commit these changes so they get to the
local repository now let's switch to the
other branch and if you remember we do
this by running git checkout and the
name of the branch and at this point we
do the same operation here so we take
this file and we change it here - in
this case we add content that reflects
the fact that we are in the new branch
just for convenience ok at this point we
also commit the file here the comment
here is of course that this is the new
file in the new branch so at this point
what we have here is that we have this
file called new file that has been
modified independently both in the
master branch in in the new branch so we
have a conflict right so now let's
switch back to the master branch so now
let's say that we want to merge the two
branches so since we are in master we
want to say
you want to merge the new branch into
the current one and when we run that we
get an auto merging conflict so at this
point what we can do is that we can
manually fix the conflict by opening the
new file so the file that we're showing
the conflict so here you can see the
kind of information that you get in the
conflicted file so it's telling you
basically that there is in the head
which is the master this content which
is new file in master which is the
content that we added of course and then
you know under you know this separator
you can see the content that was added
in the new branch which is the contents
a new file a new branch so basically
what this is showing you is the parts of
the file that are conflicting in this
case is we have only one line is
basically the whole file in the two
versions and you can decide which
version you want to keep or how you want
to merge in general the two pieces so
here let's assume that we want to keep
the content from the master so what
we're going to do is we're going to
eliminate the annotations and we're
going to eliminate the additional
content we save this file so at this
point what we need to do is simply to
commit the modified file the merge file
and we do that in the normal way we call
get add specifying the file so git add
new file then we run git commit new file
and we specify in the comment for
clarity that this is the merged file so
that we performed a merge and at this
point we are done with our merge</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
