work if you found this number will start
with the right triangle with side links
18 inches and 24 inches we'll use X for
the length of the hypotenuse since
that's what we're finding now we just
plug into the Pythagorean theorem
squaring the legs and squaring our
unknown hypotenuse length when we square
18 we get 324 and when we square 24 we
get 576 the sum of these equals nine
hundred and now we can take the square
root of both sides to solve for x here
we'll keep the positive root only since
we're talking about distance the length
of this hypotenuse is 30 inches this
triangle is actually a special right
triangle with side links in the ratio of
three to four to five so we can actually
use this to help us solve for x without
using the Pythagorean theorem if we
multiply 3 by 6 we'll get 18 and if we
multiply 4 by 6 will get 24 this means
to find this unknown hypotenuse we would
multiply the hypotenuse of 5 by our same
multiplier 6 we multiply 5 times 6 will
get 30 now not every right triangle will
be so special in this case it was since
these side links were in the ratio of
three to four to five this is why we
looked at those Pythagorean triples
earlier sometimes they can help us
problem solve more quickly but either
way we solve we'll still get a
hypotenuse of 30</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
