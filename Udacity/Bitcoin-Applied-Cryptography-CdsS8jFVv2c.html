about this unit is Bitcoin which is a
way to do digital cash in a completely
decentralized way this means that
there's no bank there's no trusted
Authority but everyone who participates
in the protocol is considered a peer and
they all have an equal say as to what's
valued and what's not
Bitcoin combines lots of ideas from
previous protocols but the but the
particular way the Bitcoin does it was
proposed by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009 the
way it avoids needing a centralized bank
is to keep track of every single
transaction that ever happens so in
order to track transactions we have a
chain of signatures so here's how that
works some coin comes in and we'll have
to talk about how that value gets
created next for Alice to transfer that
coin what she'll do is to create a
message that includes the coin includes
that she's transferring it to Bob and
she'll sign that with her key so then
she sends that to Bob Bob can verify the
signature for Bob to transfer the coin
he'll add transfer to Kathy to that and
then sign the whole thing with his
private key and now Kathy would do the
same thing take everything that Bob sent
add a transfer message to it and signed
the whole thing with her private key and
then she can transfer it onto Doug and
every link in this chain as long as they
have all the public keys they need can
verify the entire history of
transactions so Kathy can verify the
signature of Bob opened that up verify
the signature of Alice inside it and
verify that the original coin so this is
a way to use public key cryptography to
keep track of an entire history of
transactions does it provide enough to
provide digital cash so how many times
can Bob spend the coin</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
