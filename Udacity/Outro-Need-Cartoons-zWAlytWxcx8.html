something that we've just got to live
with what's more when we design
applications we have to take into
account that failures can happen and
that's important at all different levels
at the application level as well as at
the network level here's a story from a
system I used to work on several years
before coming to Udacity i'm going to
leave off the names and numbers to
protect the not so innocent my team
system was a back-end data service that
a number of other services depended on
he was also really busy it got thousands
of requests every second and almost all
of them it handled just fine but when I
got overloaded our system would fail
some requests that sometimes the best
thing a system can do to shed load and
make sure I can stay up at all
unfortunately one of the services that
used ours responded to failures by
retrying each request up to three times
so when things started to get overloaded
and our system dropped a few requests
that other service started sending more
and more requests making the overload
problem very much worse very quickly
fortunately it didn't take us very long
to track down the owners of other
service and politely inform them that
they would be stopping this little retry
behavior now please in the next lesson
you'll see a bit about how I CP handles
heavy network load without falling over
but don't forget the network can't save
you from buggy applications design your
error handling with care</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
