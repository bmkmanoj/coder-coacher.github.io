practices of XP are I want to go back
for a minute to discussion of
requirements engineering in XP in XP
user requirements are expressed as
scenarios or user stories as we already
discussed these are written by customers
on cards and what the development team
does is to take these cards take these
user stories and break them down into
implementation tasks and those
implementation tasks are then used as a
basis for schedule and cost estimates so
given these estimates and based on their
priorities the customer will choose the
stories that will be included in the
next release in the next iteration and
at this point the corresponding cards
will be taken by the developers and the
task will be performed and the relative
and the corresponding code will be
developed and just to give an idea of
the order of magnitude if you consider a
few months project there might be 50 to
100 user stories for a project of that
duration so now let me give you an
example of what the story card might
look like and I'm gonna do it using a
story card for document downloading and
you can really doll is basically saying
what the scenario is downloading and
printing an article and then it
describes basically what happens when
you do that what is the scenario first
you select the article that you want
from a display list
you then have to tell the system how you
will pay for it this can either be
through a subscription through a company
account or by credit card and so on so
what developers do they take this story
card and they break it down into
development tasks so here I'm showing
you some examples of tasks cards for the
user story that we just saw in
particular I'm showing three test cards
and if you look at the third one there
is a name for the task which is
implement p.m. and collection so this is
the development test that we have to
perform and here there is a description
of what that developed code should do
and notice that you know the task card
can even be more explicit than this more
specific than this and talk about actual
development tasks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
