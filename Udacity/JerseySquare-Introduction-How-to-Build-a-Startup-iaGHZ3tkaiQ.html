course let's take a look at what a team
actually could accomplish at the end of
this process now imagine you had ten
weeks or months or a year to go do this
you'd actually be able to do a lot but
what if we gave you five days I want to
give you an example of a team from one
of our classes that decided they were
going to provide a rental service for
professional sports jerseys and in five
days five days they personally got out
of the building and spoke to a hundred
and sixty nine customers and had 190
people come to their website and
actually sold two things during the
class let's take a look at what their
business model canvas started with and
evolved to so on day one these were
their initial hypotheses coming into the
class they thought that their customer
segments was going to be professional
sports game attendees we're going to be
male adult less than $100,000 income and
attend 10 games per year that is they
were beginning with a series of
hypotheses about their customer
archetype and they thought their value
proposition was going to provide a
cheaper way to officially-licensed
sports jerseys to a game eliminate the
risk of opening a player whose jersey is
traded and to provide alternatives to
purchasing counterfeit jerseys and their
sales channel is going to be web sites
or stadium shops or ticket websites or
direct mail and how they were going to
create demand was through search ads
social media stadium promotions and
their revenue stream is going to be
through us annual subscription model and
on the left-hand side kind of the
backstage of the business model canvas
their activities we're going to be
rental tracking shipping dry-cleaning
marketing customer service and they were
going to have to have his resources
inventory of jerseys warehouses logistic
systems and their key partners might be
the professional sports league and the
suppliers and the dry cleaners and the
shop vendors and envelope suppliers and
UPS and FedEx and the Postal Service and
their cost structure was going to be for
warehousing shipping cleaning logistics
tracking website development and
maintenance and this sounds particularly
reasonable we look at this and go
absolutely why do I even need to be in
class but they got out of the building
and spoke to 60 people 60 people by
going to Yankee Stadium and actually
meeting a bunch of customers on the
first day and look what happened they
realized that actually women for sports
jerseys as well and there was no way you
could have convinced them of that until
they stood in front of customers
at Yankee Stadium and said hey it's a
50/50 split and that it was actually
young adults 18th of 30 and they
actually were casual sports fans and now
they started to get a better
understanding of our customer
relationships were about getting
customers keeping them and growing them
and they realized that people would
maybe also be interested in a paper
rental model as well as an annual
subscription next they got out of the
building again and now they started
expanding who their customer segment
ones and they actually split the segment
into two they realized there were two
different archetypes sports Jersey
owners who were male 13 to 35 but there
was also another archetype which were
people who attended a single game and
they were male and female 18 to 30 and
they were casual fans and so now they
actually were able to take their revenue
stream and match it to their archetype
so for sports Jersey owners an annual
subscription made sense but for single
game attendees paper rental made sense
and their value prop differed for again
those two different archetypes as you'll
see later what we need is every time we
have a unique archetype we need at
minimum a matching value proposition and
a matching revenue model for each
archetype the fourth day they learn some
more things most importantly they
learned how much would some of those
sports Jersey owners actually pay in an
annual subscription they actually
started asking some serious solid
numbers and the answer they got back was
$200 and they also understood that
social media would be a big component in
customer acquisition the next day they
learned some more they actually learned
that another alternative for sports
Jersey owners
be a monthly subscription and also a
one-time rental and they start thinking
about how would you keep those customers
that is how would you eliminate churn
and increase loyalty and they start to
think about seniority loyalty programs
and how they would grow those customers
by cross-selling and upselling them with
premiums of subscriptions and family
plans so you could see after five days
just five days after talking to a
hundred and sixty customers you could
see how the business model evolved
dramatically from something that looked
like this on day one to something that
looked like this on day five day one a
series of untested hypotheses a faith
based enterprise on day five the faith
has turned into facts and this startup
is on the road to actually building
something that customers might want so
in the rest of these lectures we're
going to take you through each one of
the business model components and hoping
you'll get out of the building
choose to like this team to test each
one of your hypotheses</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
