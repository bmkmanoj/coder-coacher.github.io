about correlation and causation we
briefly discussed this in Lesson one
with the golden arches theory of
conflict resolution which has since been
disproven but still it's kind of funny
to think that McDonald's might cause
World Peace we found this really cute
cartoon online the link is at the bottom
it's a little joke that illustrates the
difference between correlation and
causation but we're leaving out the last
line cuz that's the punchline first
we're going to discuss correlation
versus causation causation means that
one variable caused another to happen
for example the fact that it was raining
caused a bunch of people to bring their
umbrellas to work but correlation just
means that there's a relationship for
example do happy people have more
friends is it just because they're happy
that they have more friends or does them
being happy cause them to act a certain
way which then causes them to have more
friends we never know there are always
lurking variables we might have two
variables x and y and they have a
relationship but only because both of
them are influenced by variable a or
maybe X influences Y through variable a
a is called a mediating variable by just
looking at scatter plots and the
correlation we don't know what the case
is we can just see some kind of
relationship in order to make causal
statements for one thing the independent
variable would have to occur before the
dependent variable and we have to be
able to rule out any lurking variables
with age and pets this one's kind of
easy because we know that having more
pets doesn't cause you to age but others
like happiness and number of friends are
kind of ambiguous maybe having more
friends causes you to be happy or maybe
being happy causes you to have more
friends we don't know even if one comes
before the other this doesn't
necessarily mean that the first variable
caused the second I'm sure you can think
of all sorts of examples where that
wouldn't be true</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
