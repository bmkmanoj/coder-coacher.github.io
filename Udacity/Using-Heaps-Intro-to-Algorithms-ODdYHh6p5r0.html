the algorithm so what's the running time
of Dykstra in terms of the number of
nodes and edges em when heaps are used
the kinds of heaps we've been talking
about to be able to find the shortest
distance so far so we can lock that down
and n move on so here's here's the
sketch of the algorithm again for each
node we find the shortest distance so
far remove it from the set because that
one's now done we actually know the
distance to that node then we check each
of its neighbors possibly reducing the
distance which wasn't a really big deal
before but it actually matters in the
heap implementation because once we've
reduced the value associated with the
node it needs to maybe be someplace
different in the heap so in your
implementation the thing you're going to
have to really watch out for is making
sure that when you update the value of a
neighbor you can find it in the heap
update the heap so that it be give the
heap property is restored and all of
this information is communicated back
and forth all right but let's imagine
that we can do that and in fact reducing
the distance of a value turns out to be
you can use a peep of Phi to do that
because the value here let me draw if we
have some value in a heap and we know
that the heap property is satisfied and
what does that mean that means that this
node has to have a bigger value or no
smaller value than its parent and it has
to itself be smaller than both of its
children let's take a closer look at the
issues that arise in a heap if one of
the values let's say we have this one is
suddenly reduced it gets smaller so
let's just use a concrete example if the
heap property is satisfied that means
that whatever value this guy has let's
say it's 10 has to be smaller than both
of its children but bigger or no smaller
than its parent so what can happen if
this node has its value reduced well
let's say it gets reduced a lot lets it
gets reduced all the way down to one the
heap property is no longer necessarily
satisfied it's actually fine from this
node down so this is fine the problem is
that this node to its parent might no
longer satisfy the heap property but the
good news is we talked about an
operation that fixes exactly this
problem so if this is node I if we run
up heapify on this heap with the pointer
to I what it's going to do is bubble
this small value up as high
as it needs to be in the tree it's going
to take big theta of log n time and then
the heat property will be restored and
all will be well so that's actually not
a big problem this you already have
implemented the thing that makes this
tricky is when you're talking about some
particular node let's say node are you
need to be able to find out very quickly
in constant time where node are is in
the heap and as things get moved around
in the heap we have to keep that
information updated so that's that's
really the just that bookkeeping is
actually the the main thing that makes
this challenging but let's take a look
at the running time given that we can do
this distance reduction operation in
logarithmic time so for each node we
find the shortest distance and then for
each node in each of its neighbors that
is to say for each edge we possibly
reduce its distance of a note so what
does that give us for a running time for
this entire algorithm so I want you to
think it through and when you think you
understand what the running time is find
it in this list and check it off</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
