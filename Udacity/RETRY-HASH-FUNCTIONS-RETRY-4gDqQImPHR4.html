algorithms is hash functions hash
functions don't use keys a hash function
computes the hash or the message digest
of data of any size the hash or the
message digest is a fixed length output
typically in the range of 128 to 512
bits hash functions are typically useful
authentication and protection of message
authenticity and integrity in order to
provide these services hash functions
must satisfy these following properties
first it should be relatively easy to
compute a hash of a given message M this
would make hardware and software
implementations practical in other words
we want to be able to compute hash very
efficiently second for given hash value
it should be conditionally infeasible to
find the original message m such that
the hash of M is this given hash value
this so-called one-way poverty is very
important for example suppose Alice
wants to authenticate herself to Bob
Alice would hatch a secret that she
shares with Bob as with the current time
stamp together for example she can
concatenate the secret s with the
current timestamp together and their
hash over the concatenated value and
send a hash value over to Bob Bob will
know that this must be Alice because he
can check the current timestamp and he
has the share secret s in other words
bug can take the current timestamp
concatenated with the share secret s and
compile his own hash and compare with a
hash value with a received hash value if
they match then he knows that he's been
communicating with Alice now because the
hash value is transmitted over the
Internet and we must assume that an
attacker can obtain any value that's
transmitted over the Internet that is
the attacker may be able to obtain this
hash value if the hash function is not
one way that means the attacker can
reverse the
function and find out the input to the
hash function which includes the share
secret s if the attacker knows the share
secret s then the attacker can
impersonate Alice to Bob above to Alice
so this is an example that demonstrates
that the one-way property of hash
function is essential another property
of hash function is that given a message
m1 it should be computationally
infeasible to find a different message
m2 such that they have the exact same
hash value this is the weak
collision-resistant property this is an
essential property for message
authenticity and integrity protection
imagine the following situation Alice
wants to send a message M to Bob and she
wants to make sure that Bob knows that
Alice is the real author of M so Alice
is gonna send em along with a sign hash
of M meaning that Alice would hatch M
and then sign the hash using her private
key now an attacker can look at the
traffic on internet and find that alice
is sending m and ensign hash to Bob
if the weak collision-resistant property
is not there then the attacker may be
able to find a different message m pipe
such that the hash of M pi will be the
same as the hash of M therefore although
the attacker has changed the message
from M to M pipe the signature will
still match and therefore when Bob
receives M pipe and the original
signature of hash of M but will not know
that the message has been changed from M
to M pipe this is a simple example to
show that the weak collision resistant
property is essential to protect message
authenticity and integrity there is a
stronger version of the collision
resistant property it says that it
should be computationally infeasible to
find different messages m1 m2 such that
they have exactly the same hash value
this is a stronger poverty because it
prevents the attacker from coming up
with two different messages they had the
same hash value again this
is essential for protecting message
authenticity and integrity for example
suppose Bob can write a IOU message and
send it to Alice to sign again the way
that Alice was sign it is to hash the
message first and then sign the hash
using a private key if Bob can find two
different messages that had the same
hash value one of which requires Alice
to pay a small amount and the other
requires her to pay a very large amount
and the two different messages have
exactly the same hash suppose Bob sends
the message with a small amount for
Alice to sign after Bob receives Alice's
signature on the message with a small
amount Bob can then go around and claim
that Alice owes her a larger amount
because the two different messages have
the same hash and the signatures would
then be the same it should be obvious
that if a hash function satisfies the
strong collision-resistant property it
automatically satisfies the weak
collision-resistant poverty</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
