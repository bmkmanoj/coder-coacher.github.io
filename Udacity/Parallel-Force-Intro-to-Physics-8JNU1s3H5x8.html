let's think of Peter pulling his sister
Annie in a car Scott this rope here and
it's connected to the cart and the Rope
actually makes an angle of 30 degrees
well let me give you some other
information the mass of the cart and
Annie together is 25 kilograms the force
that Peters pulling with is 10 Newtons
and I want to know if Peter pulls Annie
for 15 meters how much work does he do
we might be tempted to say while work
it's just force times distance he's
pulling with a force of 10 Newtons over
a distance of 50 meters shouldn't it be
a hundred and fifty joules the answer is
no we shouldn't be using this entire
force of 10 Newtons just the parallel
component and let me show you what I
mean I'm going to have to erase Peter
and Annie now because this drawing is
just getting too cluttered
instead Annie's going to become a box
Peters pulling with a force will call F
P and as always there's going to be some
normal force now I know the direction of
motion of this car is going to be along
the street this way that means I want to
break this force into components and
this is something we know how to do here
I've broken it into what we can call a
parallel component because this line is
parallel to the direction of motion and
there's a perpendicular component and I
remember that this angle is 30 degrees
now can you tell me if Peter pulls an e
for 15 meters how much work to see to
and to your answer here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
