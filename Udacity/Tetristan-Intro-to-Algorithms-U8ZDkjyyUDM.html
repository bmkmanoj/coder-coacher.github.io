beginning of unit 6 which is going to
cover the hardness of network problems
all right I made another magic trick and
I'm going to share with you now so this
is a map of a country that used to be
part of the old Soviet Union called
Tetris dam and it consists of eight
counties which I've labeled a b c d e f
g and h and what i'd like you to do is
color the map each one with one of three
colors so that no two counties that are
touching share the same color and then I
want you to number those colors zero one
and two and then depending on which
numbers you assign to which colors and
which colors you assigned to which
counties I want you to calculate the
color of county D plus the color of
county F plus the color of county C
times the color of County G minus the
color of County A plus the color of
County H I want you to work out what
that number is and then write it in this
block but before you write it let me see
if I can guess what it's going to be yes
yes I have a very good guess as to what
it's going to be but you write it in and
let me make sure I'm right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
