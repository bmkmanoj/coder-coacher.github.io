value of hashing s 98 times the hash
chain is going backwards we can only
verify hashes in one direction the hash
is hard to compute in one direction
that's the valuable property the hash
function gives us and so we have to go
backwards if we want to use it for
authentication and here we're using a
10k Dallas if someone just knows X if
someone intercepts P knows the previous
password value well they could compute
any of these other values those are easy
to compute once you have P well this was
P this one is just computing the hash of
P and this one is computing the hash of
the hash of P the only one that would be
hard to compute is this one the server
can check that that's correct using the
same process at this point the value of
x is hash 99 of s so when the value of P
that's sent is hash to the 98th power of
s doing hash 98 times well then this
equation will be true only if the value
sent was correct so what I've described
as what's known as the S key password
system and the way s key would work the
server would generate the hash chain
let's say they're a hundred entries
Alice would print these out in a list
and they would be turned into strings
that are easier to type than pure bit
sequences the server would store the
last entry in that hash chain and
nothing else and so what's stored in the
server could not be used to log in the
list that Alice has could be used and I
should correct this that if Alice starts
with H 100 is the first thing in her
list what the server should actually
store would be H 101 this has a pretty
big downside that it requires Alice to
carry around with her a list of
passwords and instead of remembering
something that becomes easier and easier
to type well she'd have to look at that
list type the password correctly cross
that one off and use the next one next
time and at some point she's gonna run
out she's gonna need to get on a secure
connection again to generate a new hash
chain to be able to keep doing this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
