running time for Givens input size is no
longer than the best measured time for
each algorithm this is true to think
about this all you really need to do is
realize that by definition the best case
running time is better than all other
possible running times so if there's one
smaller than it well it's not really the
best is it and you can think of the same
thing for the worst-case running time
for the second one which is also true
the worst-case running time for given
input size is at least the worst
measured time for each algorithm because
if there is a worst or a worse or a
longer measured time than the worst-case
running time well then it's not worst is
it now for the third question algorithm
beta is the fastest for all inputs this
is actually false and even though it's
actually true for all of the inputs that
we tested it might not be true for much
smaller inputs for example N equals one
or two we can't say that it's the
fastest for all inputs because well we
haven't tested it on all inputs it might
very well be the case but in order to
say that we actually would need to test
it and that's not really feasible and
the for the final question we're asking
for small inputs the algorithm with
exponential behavior is faster than the
algorithm with polynomial behavior and
this is actually true if you look at
alpha and gamma alpha being the
exponential algorithm and gamma being
the polynomial one actually is faster 25
minutes is quite a bit faster than 500
so this is actually true it's
interesting see that sometimes for small
inputs an exponential algorithm isn't
really that big of a deal</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
