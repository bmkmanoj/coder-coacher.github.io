you're clear on when the MapReduce
programming model is appropriate and
when it isn't people use the term big
data a lot but often data isn't actually
that big in the grand scheme of things
some people might tell you that big data
is anything too large to deal with
easily in Excel that's definitely not
the case it's generally safe to say that
your data is quote unquote big if it's
too large to fit onto one disk a
reasonable size at which to set the
lower bound for big data at this point
in time is probably about five terabytes
for example say Google was trying to
catalog and index all of the books in
the world to find out which words have
appeared most often it'd be impossible
to load the text from all the books in
the world onto a single disk it's simply
too much data this is when we should
look to the MapReduce programming model
beyond this first constraint because of
the specifics of the MapReduce
programming model MapReduce only works
for tasks where you hope to employ many
workers simultaneously who do not have
knowledge of each other's actions why is
that MapReduce splits a large job up
into several smaller chunks that each
fit onto one machine and occur
simultaneously these machines do not
communicate with each other while
performing their computations certain
tasks that would be very easy to do
using a sequel like database or a simple
Python script can become very complex
when attempting to do them using
MapReduce because of this the smartest
thing to do is to only use MapReduce
when your data is truly big</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
