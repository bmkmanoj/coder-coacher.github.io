about Kate's family we should know that
fourth answer represents the pedigree of
lactose intolerance for Kate's family
remember kate is lactose intolerant but
not our brother so when we look at these
five options down here we should be
looking for a pedigree that has a female
symbol or circle that shaded in meaning
that they are affected by lactose
intolerance this pedigree here has an
unaffected female and an affected
brother so that's not what we want all
of the other four pedigrees have an
affected female with an unaffected
brother so now we go up a generation and
look at the parents we see that based on
information neither of Kate's parents
are lactose intolerant well if neither
of our pantry lactose intolerant they
shouldn't be shaded at all this one is a
shaded parent so that can't be right and
this one has a shaded parent so an
effective parent so that can't be right
only these two pedigree show parents
that are unaffected unshaded and the
last piece of information is that the
maternal grandfather and paternal aunt
are intolerant like k so we need to find
where the mother's grandfather is
affected which is right here over here
it's the paternal grandfather right
there's the grandfather but it's on the
father side based on the square male
symbol although the paternal and is
preserved in both of these pedigrees
where you see the sister of the father
here the unaffected father the sister is
affected but because this is the
paternal grandfather and not the
maternal grandfather we know that's not
right and it leaves us with this one
pedigree here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
