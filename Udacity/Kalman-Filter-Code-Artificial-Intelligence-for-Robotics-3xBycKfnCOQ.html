let's write a main program that takes
these two functions update and predict
and feeds it into a sequence of
measurements and motions the example
I've chosen years the measurements are
five six seven nine and ten the motions
are 1 1 2 1 1 this all would work out
very well if the initial put estimate
was 5 while we're setting it to 0 with a
very large uncertainty of 10,000 let's
assume the measurement uncertainty is
constant 4 and the motion uncertain is
constant 2 and when you run this your
first estimate for position should
basically become 5 4.99 and the reason
is the initial uncertainty is so large
the estimate is dominated by your first
measurement you uncertainty shrinks to
3.9 9 which is slightly better than the
measurement uncertainty you then predict
that you add 1 but the uncertainty
increases do 5.99 which is the motion
uncertainty of 2 you update again based
on the measurement 6 you get your
estimate of 5.99 which is almost 6 you
move one again you measure 7 you move to
you measure 9 you move one you made a 10
and you move a final one and out comes
as the final result a prediction of
10.99 for the position which is your
tenth position moved by 1 and the
uncertainty residual uncertainty of 4
can you implement this so you get
exactly the same outputs as I've gotten
