to look for a couple of things in the
results these can tell us how solid the
model is what factors are most important
and possibly changes to the model to
rerun the first thing to look for is
something called the out of the bag
error rate this explains how well the
model performed with the
cross-validation set in the estimation
sample this gives us a good
understanding of how solid the model
performs with just the estimation data
you can think of it in the same terms as
an r-squared value what we also look for
is the confusion matrix this shows again
how well the model performed on the
original estimation data compared to the
out of the bag error rate the confusion
matrix does a better job of representing
where errors occurred in classifying the
data as you've learned when we run a
forest model we're using an ensemble of
decision trees this can be
computationally intensive so let's have
a look at the percentage error for the
different number of trees graph we can
use this to help us see what the correct
number of trees is to use so we can
avoid over computing what we are looking
for is the number of trees it takes to
minimize the error of each of the items
so basically where it is a flat line
after we determine this number we can
change the subsequent force models to
run this data to this smaller number of
decision trees finally we need to look
for which predictor variables matter the
most in this relation to the model this
is very helpful in determining which
variables are most associated with our
data and we can focus on this for future
analysis let's examine these things over
in all tricks now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
