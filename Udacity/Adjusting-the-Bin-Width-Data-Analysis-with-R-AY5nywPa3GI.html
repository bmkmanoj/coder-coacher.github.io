benefits of altering the bin width let's
try it for ourselves looking at the
histogram we created earlier we can see
that it's skewed we've just zoomed in on
the left side of the graph from the
histogram from before working from this
new histogram let's add some better
labels and some bidding to adjust the
bin width I can pass the bin width
parameter to cue plot and for this data
I'm gonna choose a value of 25 that
seems pretty reasonable since we're
going from zero to a thousand the other
thing I want to do is break up this
x-axis every say 50 units to do that I'm
gonna pass the breaks parameter to our
scale X continuous layer breaks is gonna
take a sequence that has a starting
point an ending point and the step or
the interval space we want on our axis
so in this case I'm going from zero to a
thousand and I want to step every 50
units you can learn more about how to
manipulate the scale and the brakes on
the X or Y axis by reading the link in
the instructor note when I run the code
I can see that to get a completely
different histogram taking a closer look
it's easy to see that many users have
less than 25 friends these users are
probably new now let's ask a more
interesting question which gender group
on average has more friends men or women
to answer this question we need to split
this histogram into two plots for males
and females let's see if you can do that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
