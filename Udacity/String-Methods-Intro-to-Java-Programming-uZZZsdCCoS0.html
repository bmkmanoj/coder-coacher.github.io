objects is to use lots of them here we
will look at strings and we will do it
in three ways with bluej objects with
Java code and with another nifty tool
called the code pad in the code pad as
you'll see in a minute I can type in
code and have it executed right away
without having to compile anything or
without having to click on the bubbles
the code pad is so nifty that it's a
shame that it's hidden to reveal it
select view and show code pad and then
they make it so small which is also a
shame let's make it much much bigger in
the code pad I can write a regular Java
statements here I declare a variable
here I have a print statement and as
soon as I hit the enter key it gets
executed you see a window pops up that
has the output but what's even better
any value that a type in here gets
displayed right away let me show you
I type River dot length and the answer
11 is displayed as soon as I hit the
enter key it's important that you don't
type a semicolon because otherwise the
code pad thinks that you have a
statement leg up here no semicolon tells
it that it should immediately print the
value off the code that you're right
here I type the name of the variable
without a semicolon and it's printed the
string Mississippi and to the left I
have a little blob that I can drag into
the workbench here it goes I drop it in
the workbench now I'm supposed to give
it a name I'll give it the same name
that the variable has the river and over
here I have a familiar bluej blob that I
can manipulate in the usual way I can
right click on it and now the string
class has many many methods but I want
to call length when I selected the
length method I get the answer 11 so I
can get the same answer in two different
ways which one is better
it really depends sometimes I prefer to
use the Blue Jay bubbles for quick
experimentation because you can't really
make any typos sometimes I prefer to use
the code pad because it's just easier to
type in maybe to copy and paste in what
you want both of those are great for
experimenting with classes and objects
and to just find out what happens when
you call a particular method you should
try them both and see which one you like
better of course for more hardcore
programming for writing a program that
gets repeated over and over again one
wants to write an actual java class with
a main method in that case as you know
you right-click on the empty space make
a new class right-click open the editor
and start typing then you put your code
into the main method here I wrote a
couple of lines of code that let me
compute the length of this string you
compile you run and you get the answer
that's more work at first and it'll pay
off when you write a longer program for
short explorations the object bubbles
and the code pad are hard to beat so go
ahead fire up bluejay and work along
with Sarah to explore the string class
and its methods</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
