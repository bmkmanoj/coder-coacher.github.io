so 2 to the power of n 1.73 3 to the
power of n hmm doesn't sound too good
but there's two things to keep in mind
here first of all this is a worst-case
analysis so in practice we might be
doing actually better and the second
thing is even in a worst-case analysis
because we're dealing with exponential
time this improvement here is actually
huge so let's say that we're looking at
an input of size 50 then 2 to the power
of n assignments would be 10 to the
power of 15 about 1.1 3 times 10 to the
power of 50 so this is almost infeasible
I mean maybe with a very very very very
very powerful computer but probably
wouldn't want to do this and probably
also wouldn't want to do this for more
than a single graph if however you have
the smarter search tree then you have
1.73 3 to the power of n which is 1.73 3
to the power of 50 and that is about 8.7
1 times 10 to 11 and the difference here
is a speed-up of over 1,000 that speed
up will become larger as n grows larger
and the other thing is again that this
down here is only a worst-case analysis
in many practical cases the search tree
will be much smaller because first of
all as we saw it's often the case that
you assign more than just two vertices
and in that case the tree doesn't become
as high and also you can apply various
other optimizations some of which we're
soon going to talk about to make this
search tree even smaller both in
practical cases and in the worst case
now should Alice be happy about this
well probably not yet because already
for n equal to 50 the running time of
the algorithm here gets rather large so
if she is solving the problem for a
telecommunications network with say 500
vs. it'll still be out of the question
to find an optimal solution using the
search tree but of course there's a
little help already because we haven't
really fully explored search trees yet
maybe it's going to get even better for
her but before we continue helping Ellis
let's have a look at Bob and Carol and
see if we can apply smart search trees
also for their problems independent set
and clique</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
