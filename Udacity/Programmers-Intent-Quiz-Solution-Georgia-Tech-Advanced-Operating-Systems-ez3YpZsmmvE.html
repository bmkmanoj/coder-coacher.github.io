on the same wavelength and the next few
panels I'm going to show you how this
particular programming construct that a
multi-threaded program may execute in
terms of producer and a consumer can
actually be a clown accomplished with
simple read/write atomic operations
available in the instruction set of a
processor the solution it turns out is
surprisingly very simple the idea is
that between p1 and p2 i'm going to
introduce a new variable a shared
variable and that variable i'll call it
a flag and I'll initiate initialize this
flag to be 0 to start with and the
agreement between these two producers
and consumer is that the producer will
modify the data structure that he wants
to modify and once he's done with the
modification he will set this flag to be
a one and that's the signal to 2p to
that that this guy is done with the
modification now what is p2 doing well
p2 is basically waiting for this flag
which unleash initially the flag was
initially 0 and and basically the
process of p2 is waiting for this flag
to change from the 0 to 1 now once p 1
is done with its modification it's going
to set this flag to 0 to a 1 and that's
the signal that this guy waiting for and
as soon as this flag changes to a 1 then
he'll break out of this spin loop here
and he's now ready to use the data
structure and once he's done using the
data structure you can flip it back to
zero to indicate that he is that he's
done using it so that the next time if
the producer wants to modify it again
you can do that so that's sort of the
solution now let's analyze the solution
and see why it works it was just atomic
reads and writes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
