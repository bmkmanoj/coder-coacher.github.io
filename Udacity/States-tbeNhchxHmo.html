states and events both of these are
abstract but nevertheless useful in
describing system behavior a state is an
abstract description of a set of system
values at a given point of time for
example it's raining outside this is
actually some estimation or abstraction
over the amount of precipitation in the
air at a given point in time let's
imagine a slightly more complex
situation in the imaginary town of
Descartes Iowa that has ten streets and
eighth avenues laid out in orthogonal
grid and let's say we were trying to
imagine the state of the town that had
one car in it the position of that car
in this imaginary scenario is at third
Street and Fifth Avenue the number of
possible states it could be in is a t10
streets eighth avenues for two cars
though the number of possible states
goes up with a square that is 80 times
80 or 6,400 possible states the state
space of a system is the set of all
possible States and its size goes up
multiplicatively with a number of
different attributes that we're trying
to capture and the number of
possibilities that each attribute has
this is called the state explosion
