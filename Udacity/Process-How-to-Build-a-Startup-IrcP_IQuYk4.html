physically built a started what was the
process we used we used to build
startups by managing processes we said
well hey we understand how to build
products we built them exactly like we
build them in large companies we hire
product managers and we do something
called waterfall engineering which I'll
explain in a second which basically are
step by step by step in fact what we
used to do is we used to draw this
diagram on napkins we used to say well
you come up with a concept then you
raise some seed funding and then you go
into product development and then you
have alpha test beta test and first
customership
what can be wrong with that that's in
fact for 30-40 years this was the
canonical model for how to build
startups and we'd say marketing well we
understand while engineering is
developing the product marketing is
creating all the marketing
communications material and you know
hiring a PR agency and creating early
buzz and then for marketing the world's
most fun job was have the party you get
to create demand by having a launch
event and you think about branding and
your job really was to create end-user
demand and drive it into the potential
sales channel for sales what that meant
is unless the VP of Sales was a founder
you tended to hire them around the time
engineering was saying we're in alpha
and beta test and they were going out
and starting to hire their first sales
staff and they were looking at your
five-year revenue plan and since it was
obviously came from a burning bush and
it was the Word of God they were just
going to execute that plan why cuz it
said so and you know and you said so and
if you had investors they said so there
might not be any facts behind it but
there it was it was the spreadsheet and
so they were building the sales
organization so again and at first
customership
if marketing was going to drive demand
they were just going to have a sales
curve that took off because the revenue
plan said so the next piece was the biz
dev group and business development used
to mean the group that put together all
the deals to create the whole product wh
o le the whole product meant startups
just because of their size are incapable
of creating all the features and and
services etc that a mainstream customer
need so why don't we hire business
development people to do partnerships so
at first customership
we could look like a large company for
mainstream customers
the only fallacy in this is that you
assume that your first customers are
going to be in the mainstream it turns
out for most startups your first
customers are actually crazy people like
you and so therefore creating this
entire cloud of deals are actually
useful a year after first customership
but in fact just get in your way on day
one the other piece is engineering and
engineering how simple could that be it
was understood we did exactly what we
did in large corporations you wrote a
market requirements document then
engineering shut their doors rolled up
their sleeves and went into waterfall
engineering which will describe a little
later you hired a QA department then at
the end finally when it was all done you
hired a tech pubs department and all the
product was ready to go in version 100
all the features at one time at first
customership
and this for 30 or 40 years was the way
we thought about startups there can be
no other way this is how we manage the
process we now know this is just simply
wrong and I'll explain to you what we're
going to do instead</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
