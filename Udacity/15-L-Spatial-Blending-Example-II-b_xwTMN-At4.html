there are two data inputs one is t4
target these are the trade areas for the
stores the other is you for universe and
these are the customer locations the
spatial object field for the target is
the trade area for the universe it's the
centroid of the customers the customer
points next we select how we want the
target to interact with the universe in
this scenario we can choose either
intersect or contains and it will return
the same result the trade area surface
can both intersect the point locations
and the trade area surface can also
contain the point locations either of
these options work for this interaction
I'll stick with intersects you can see
below then when you do a spatial match
there is essentially a joint happening
as the fields of the two files can be
output for each record let's run the
workflow we can see that for each store
we have a list of customers that fall
within the five-mile radius of that
store if we want to count up the
customers that fall in each stores trade
area we can simply add in a summarized
tool we group by on the store ID and
simply count the number of customers
what we see is that there are four store
locations and here are the customers the
fall within those five mile trade areas
around the stores however you may have
noticed that there are actually six
store locations that were brought into
this operation and so we actually find
two records that had no customers fall
within the five-mile trade area so these
come out the unmatched side so store
five and six did not have any customers
fall within their five-mile radio</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
