the entire cluster has the mapping for
the UID saying what is the physical
frame number that corresponds to it if
it happens to be on that node or it's on
the disk that information is contained
in some PFD in the entire cluster so if
I have a page fault I convert my viedo
UID then which PFD will I go and look up
I could broadcast it to everybody and
say hey do you have it that'll be very
inefficient we don't want to do that all
we can say that there's some way of
magically mapping given a UID which node
will have the PFD for me to look up and
find out the backing physical page but
we don't want to do a static binding of
UID to the node that manages that UID
because if we make a static mapping then
it pushes the burden on one node to take
that if some page has become really hot
and everybody wants to use that so what
we want to do is distribute this
management function also just like the
Age management we did not want to
concentrate it on a single node we want
to distribute the management of giving
this mapping between UID and which road
has the PFD that can tell me information
about the missing page and that data
structure is this global cache directory
GCD so GCD is a hash table it's a
cluster wine hash table so it's a
distributed data structure and the role
that GCD performs is given a UID it'll
tell you which node has the PFD that
corresponds to this UID that's the role
of this data structure it's a
partitioned hash table so given a UID I
can say well I go to the GCD and the GCD
will say what is the PFD that has his
UID because it is a partition hash table
even though a part of the GCD is on
every node every node may not be locally
able to determine where the PFDs
given u ID
it can go it has to know which GCD it
has to consult in order to know which
node has the PFD that corresponds to
this UID so we need another leader
structure that tells us given a UID
which node has the GCD that corresponds
to this UID and that is the page
ownership directory so the page
ownership directory says given a UID
which node has the GCD that corresponds
to this UID and this data structure the
page ownership directory is is
replicated on all the nodes it's an
identical replica that is on all the
nodes so when I have a page fault first
thing that I'm going to do is go to my P
OD and that is a replicated data
structure it's complete information
up-to-date information so I go to this P
OD and ask this question given this UID
how do I find out the global cache
directory that has the information about
the PFD that can help me to map my
virtual address to a physical address
remember that we could have simply gone
from here to here but that would have
been a static mapping and this one level
of indirection is giving a way by which
we don't have to statically map a PFD to
a UID but this intermediate step allows
us to move the responsibility of hosting
a particular PFD to different nodes
using this intermediary which is a
distributed hash table I said that this
page ownership directory is a replicated
data structure can it change well it
can't change over time because what this
page ownership directory is saying is
the following the UID space is something
that spans the entire cluster if you
take the virtual addresses of all the
processes in the entire cluster that
universe of all the virtual addresses is
this UID space because it has been
mapped from a virtual address of a
single process to this UID space and
this spans the whole cluster and what
we've done is we've partitioned that UID
space into cell
of regions of ownership and that's what
is called the page ownership so every
node is responsible for a portion of the
UID space and that is this global cache
directory now if the land never evolves
or in other words the set of nodes on
the land is fixed then the page
ownership directory also remains the
same but if nodes if new nodes are added
and deleted and so on that's when the
page ownership directory is going to
change and if that happens then we have
to replicate again we have to
redistribute the page ownership
directory but this is not something
that's going to happen too often
it's very there that node is going to
come down or new node is going to be
inserted into a LAN and therefore the
space ownership directly does not change
very often and that's where it's a
replicated data structure that you can
believe at every node but if it changes
there is also a way of handling that
we'll see that in a minute
so the path for page fault handling is
if you have a page fault you convert
u-v-a to UID and once you have this UID
then you can go to your page ownership
directory that's on your known and ask
the question please tell me who has the
PFD that corresponds to this UID and GCD
is going to tell me oh here is the node
that contains the PFD for the UID that
you're looking for then I can go to that
PFD and from that PFT I can get the page
that I'm looking for which might be in
that node or it might say well it's not
in mine or anymore it's on the disk so
this is the path for page fault handling</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
