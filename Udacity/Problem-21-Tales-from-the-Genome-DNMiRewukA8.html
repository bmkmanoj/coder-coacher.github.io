of a pair of chromosomes one version has
two genes that are very close together
on the chromosome different alleles of
these genes are on each chromosome and
another version of this pair is where
these two genes are really far apart
from one another and the question wants
to know which of these would result in
the maximum number of genotype
combinations and gametes so the closer
two genes on a chromosome the less
likely crossing over can occur which
means that a plus B minus you're going
to be linked they're always going to
travel together because they're on the
same chromosome and they're really close
together but if they're far apart then
recombination can occur and then a plus
can sometimes get with B minus or B plus
depending on if the recombination occurs
or not and so this scenario is the one
that's most likely to result in the
maximum number of genotype combinations
what's the maximum number for any two
genes it's for we could have a plus with
B plus we could have a plus with B minus
a minus with B plus and a minus with B
minus that's the maximum number of
genotype combinations we could have
obviously if we add more genes to this
list depending on how far they're spaced
out we get a different number of maximum
genotype combinations</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
