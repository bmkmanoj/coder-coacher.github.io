of how an individual site that hosts
computational resources and handles a
whole bunch of incoming client requests
may handle these incoming client
requests in terms of load management
this brings us to the DQ principle the
server has all the data that is required
for dealing with incoming client queries
so this is a full data set or DF as a
full data set that is required for
handling any incoming queries to the
server now clients come in with their
queries and we will call q0 as the
offered load to the server meaning this
is the amount of requests that are
hitting the server per unit time even
though the offered load is q0 maybe the
server could only manage to serve a
portion of this incoming requests and
that portion of the incoming requests
that is completed by the server is QC
these are the completed requests we
define the yield queue as a ratio q c /
qø that is the ratio of completed
requests to the offered load so q is
going to be a fraction between 0 and 1
ideally you want it to be 1 so that all
the clients requests are serviced but if
the server is not able to deal with the
offered load entirely then the yield is
going to be less than 1 now each query
that is coming into the server may
require processing all of the data
that's available in the server to answer
this particular query for instance if
there's a google search and the search
requires looking at all the corpus of
data that the server has to answer the
query then you want to look at the full
data set DF however it may be that
because of either failures of some of
the data servers or the load on the
server it is only able to process the
query using a portion of the total data
set
so DV is the available data that is used
in processing the query in that case the
harvest d is defined as the ratio DV /
DF that is harvest is defined as the
ratio of the available data to the full
corpus of data again this is going to be
a ratio between 0 &amp;amp; 1 ideally you want
to make sure that the harvest is one
meaning that incoming request is
completely served with all the data that
it wants depending on the service i can
give you different examples so for
instance if the incoming request is a
search you want to look at the whole
corpus of data that is available to you
to answer that search but if you're not
able to do that and the server is only
using a portion of the full data than
the harvest in terms of the quality of
the results that is being given out a
particular client is less than one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
