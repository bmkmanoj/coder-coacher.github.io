for a wide array of techniques you can
use to just understand who your users
are with the goal being to learn to
design and develop better products it
can run from in lab testing where you
have head mounted tracking equipment and
all kinds of sensors to going to field
studies where you hop on airplanes and
go to all the corners of the globe to
you know watching your logs we are
getting data from millions of users and
kind of trying to understand what
they're doing and how you can do it
better or you can do it much more
cheaply much more quickly because every
little bit that you do to kind of better
understand your users is going to be
tremendously valuable to you so you can
do things like just talking to a handful
of people with taking printouts
or drawings of what you think you're
going to build and putting in front of
people and getting their responses to it
like lots of little things can help you
tease away little bits of information
about who your users are and how you can
better work for them we all think we
know ourselves pretty well so naturally
if you just kind of base on what you
know about yourself and what you want
you'll build a product that hopefully
satisfies at least you but you also come
with so many experiences so many
preconceptions so many assumptions about
what this product should be and how it
could work built on everything you've
gone through with other products before
in their life you don't share that with
all of your users and you may not even
share the same goals for this product
with your users if you want to build
something that's really successful you
need to understand them where they're
coming from where they're trying to go
and then you can build a product that
completes that story for them even if
time is short and you just have to make
a decision right now and you can't take
the time to go out and talk to other
people just by thinking about that
persona inventing it takes you out of
your own head and starts you thinking
about somebody else so it's better to
kind of build for that other even if
it's not based on kind of hard data than
to just bias towards your own needs this
was a while back but I was working on a
product for kind of bloggers who weren't
bloggers yet kind of non expert bloggers
to kind of create posts and
start sharing things and like I wasn't
interested in blogging as a product at
all so it was very much that I had to
kind of think about users who strongly
weren't me and I remember in particular
there was this desire from users that
surprised me that they just want to
record audio for their blogs they didn't
want to sit down and write it they want
to kind of compose these things they
want to be able to be out in the go and
just you know speak into their phone and
pop up comes the entry it's the kind of
thing that I would have never thought
about if I only referred like what I
would have expected out of that product
I would have assumed oh I want to spend
some time crafting this and typing this
thing but it's turned out to be one of
the most satisfying parts of the product
for users and something that was also a
differentiator between other that and
other products that were on the market</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
