most efficient sorting algorithms to do
a quick sort
you essentially pick one of the values
in the array at random move all values
larger than it above it and all values
below it lower than it the value that
you pick initially is called a pivot you
continue on recursively picking a pivot
in the upper and lower sections of the
array sorting them similarly until the
whole array is sorted okay let's watch
this in action first we need to select a
pivot the convention is to pick the last
element as your pivot so let's go ahead
and do that hmm our first element is
larger than our pivot so we need to move
it behind the pivot however we're doing
an in-place sort so we need to move the
element in front of the pivot to make
room so in this step we're moving eight
to the last block two to the
second-to-last block and ten all the way
up to the first block this seems a
little counterintuitive you would think
that we would move ten back and not
forward just hold on for now we'll see
exactly why this works soon so we did
our shift and now we can make another
comparison now we get to take a look at
ten since ten is bigger than two we need
to again move ten back move two up and
move whatever's in front of two up as
well great one more swap down finally we
have zero at the front of our array
which is actually smaller than our pivot
of two that's pretty great but now we
just move to the second element and do
the same process with that one since 3
is greater than 2 we'll need to shift
around everything again awesome this is
looking so much better since 7 is still
bigger than 2 we need to do another
comparison though here's the swap we
need to make and this is what our array
looks like no this is definitely good 2
is in the right place we've checked all
the elements before it and we're sure
they're less than it and we've put all
of these elements after that are all
definitely bigger than it because we're
sure everything in the array below 2 is
actually less than 2 and everything
above 2 is greater than
- we know that - is in the exact right
place I'm going to color code it so we
know that we don't need to move it again
at this point we normally do the same
process for everything smaller than the
pivot and everything bigger than the
pivot let's start with the smaller part
first we select our pivot and compared
to everything before since zero is
actually less than one there's nothing
we need to do and with just one
comparison we know that both of these
are in the right place and we can move
on now in the second half of the array
we select a pivot since 7 &amp;amp; 3 are both
smaller than the pivot we won't need to
move them however 8 is bigger than the
pivot so we'll need to do a swap here
now that our swaps complete we can see
that 8 and 10 are actually in their
eventual positions everything less than
8 was already below 8 so we didn't need
to move it at all ok now we only have
two elements left that maybe need to be
sorted again all we have to do here is
assign 3 as a pivot and compare will see
that these two need to be switched do
that quickly and then our whole array is
done</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
