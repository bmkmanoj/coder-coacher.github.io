the last six units how to recognize
challenging problems the theory of
np-completeness
and how you can nevertheless solve these
challenging problems using exact
techniques such as search trees
pre-processing or fixed parameter
tractability or approximate methods so
approximation algorithms or
randomization so far all of the problems
that we have looked at have had one
thing in common if you gave the computer
enough time and it has enough memory
then eventually you'll get an answer so
of course if you have an intractable
problem say an np-complete one or an
np-hard one then of course you will have
to wait a long long time to get your
answer the computer is at least in
principle able to give you an answer in
this unit we will be looking at the
ultimate limits of computation what that
means is I will show you some problems
that are not hard to solve but that are
impossible to solve so the computer has
no idea how to do this and there's two
surprising things waiting for you first
of all these problems here are very
simple surprisingly simple and the
second thing is although these problems
are totally impossible to solve actually
your computer is probably solving them
every day
so some baffling things await you in
this final unit of our course</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
