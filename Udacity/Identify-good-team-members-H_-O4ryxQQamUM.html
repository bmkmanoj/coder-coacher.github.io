those initial employees it's a really
important one and the sort of there is a
kind of they have to be Jack's of all
trades and they have to be passionate
but they also and in fact I think this
is just when you're looking for
employees in any weather to start up
whether your first employer your
hundreds what you really want are people
that have a very specific skill but are
willing and this is where the passion
comes in are willing to do whatever it
takes whether it's their job whether
it's our specialty whether it's cut
outside their their comfort zone because
if you think about a startup that grows
is going the people that start their
rules are going to change every six
months significantly the first person
handles marketing for you could be your
VPN janae year and a half you never know
what's going to happen and you need the
most adaptable people you can find and I
think that adaptability some of its a
court rate but a lot of that is really
just willingness and passion and an
ability to learn fast which is super
important obviously</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
