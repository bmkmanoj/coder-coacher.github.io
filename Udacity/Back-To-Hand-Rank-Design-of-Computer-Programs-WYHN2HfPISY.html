still have the same specification that
the input is a hand and the output is a
value indicating the ranking of a hand
but instead of having the value be an
integer like it was before now the value
is going to be a tuple where the first
element of the tuple is still going to
be the single value representing the
type of ranking 8 for a straight flush
for example but then the next element of
the tuple serves to break ties if if 8
is the highest compared to any other
hand then that's the winner but if there
are multiple hands that have an 8 they
all tie and we have to go on to the
first tiebreaker and what should the
tiebreaker be well in this case we can
just look at the high rank so we can
look at the max out of all the ranks
breaks the ties and the idea there is if
we had a hand that say was had ranks 2 3
4 5 6 then the only thing we care about
is the 6 we can completely specify this
hand because we know it's a straight so
if 6 was the high card then that tells
us everything we need to know about the
straight and how it compares to any
other straight so for that kind of hand
would get the value 8 6 and a hand that
was a 6 7 8 9 10 would get the value 8
10 and we know that this hand would win
because 8 10 is bigger than 8 6 so this
gives us a way to break ties between
straight flushes now we can do the same
type of thing for all the other rankings
so rank 7 is 4 of a kind what do we want
to put in there to break the tie well
the first tiebreaker is the thing that
you have four of a kind of so you say
I've got four of a kind four kings and
we can just say what is what do you have
for four of a kind of and then but now I
have to firm up the definition of
we weren't quite clear on what it
returns now we can make it return a
value which is the actual rank so if I
have four 7s it should return seven if I
have four tens it should return ten and
that'll be the tiebreaker and then
normally if we're playing a regular game
there would only be four of a kind in a
deck so if you had four tens the nobody
else could tie you because it wouldn't
be another four tens but we also we want
to allow for the possibility of playing
a game where there's two decks so we
could go to a tiebreaker and then the
tiebreaker would be the remaining card
in your hand which is the card that you
have one of a kind of so for example say
if you had had a hand that had four
nines and a three then our value would
be seven meaning four of a kind nine
meaning you have four nines
and then three mean that's the final
tiebreaker
now there's something a little bit
tricky here that I want to go over and
make sure we get right so here I'm kind
of overloading the idea of the function
kind I'm using it to return a value
returns nine when you have four nines
but I'm also using it as a boolean test
saying if if you have 4 of a kind at all
then do this and so I want to arrange
kind to return a false value when it
doesn't have four of a kind and to
return a true value which is a number
when you do have four of a kind and you
can do that in Python in other languages
you you would have to decide one or
another in a language like Java you
couldn't you couldn't have something
that returns either a boolean value or a
number so you'd have to have another way
of dealing with that but a Python you
can do that you can have kind return a
number when it's needed and return a
false value when it's needed now one
thing you have to worry about is it
turns out that in Java the value 0 is in
fact counted as false so if I was saying
I'm going to return either a false value
or
returned a number and if zero is one of
those possible numbers then I could be
in trouble but in this case zero is not
a possible number because the ranks go
from 2 to 14 so I'm okay
and we'll see more about that when we
define the kind function</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
