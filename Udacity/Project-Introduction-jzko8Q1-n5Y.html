you learn the most important DevOps
concepts and practices you will have
many chances to apply what you have
learned by completing projects and
getting feedback but you are probably
much more interested in knowing how that
will help you do your job better or
maybe you want to get a better job and
this is where your very first project
comes in what does it mean to work
better how do you measure the success of
a project to see improvement you need to
know what to measure and then you need
to measure changes over time right now
we are not talking about monitoring
server CPU load or measuring
click-through rates we're talking about
what you want to improve in your
everyday work and how you can measure
improvement in that that's the first
step towards the goal of continuous
improvement your task for the first
project will be to identify problems
that you face at your job both
organizational and technical how do you
know that these are problems what would
an ideal scenario look like how will you
know that things are changing either for
the better or for the worse either for
the better or for the worse this project
will be a living document you will start
it now at the very beginning of the
program and you can update it as you
continue you can mark the areas where
you don't have the knowledge or
resources to find a solution after you
have learned a bit more you can revisit
those sections and if you don't have an
organization to think about don't worry
maybe you are just between jobs or just
starting your career we will provide a
story about a fictional company that you
can use for this project if you'd like
before you get started on your project
let's look at some general issues
companies phase then we'll look at
specific issues with our fictional and
very troubled company</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
