mentioned and illustrate how you can do
this with all tricks we're going to
count how many customers fall within
five miles of each store location we
start our workflow with two files a
store location file it's an all tricks
native format with the extension why XD
be and the other file is a customer file
in CSV format notice that the customers
file has a latitude and longitude field
associated with each of the customers we
can use this data to create spatial
points for each customer making it
possible to use this data set for
spatial matching now let's go back to
the store locations notice how this file
has a field called spatial obj with a
value point that means that the records
already have a point spatial object
attached to them to confirm this we can
simply add a browse tool and run the
workflow when we do this we can see
points on a map on the left we'll use
cloud made maps as the base map layers
so that we can view the map with
reference map layers but if we add a
browse tool to the customers file will
see only tabular data no map so we know
that this file is not spatially enabled
yet to spatially enable the file we go
to the spatial category and select the
tool called create points once connected
we identify the longitude and latitude
fields in the customer file by adding a
browse tool and then running the
workflow will see the customers on a map
coming back to the stores we wanted to
find the trade area around each store as
a five mile radius to create this we add
in the trade area tool and we're going
to specify the value of the trade area
to be five and the units to be radius
and miles let's bring in a browse tool
so we can see the radii browse tools
always have to be used when we're
looking at the actual map objects
they're not required for looking at
tabular data we can see that
areas here and if we look close we can
see that there's overlap between two of
the trade areas this can actually be
removed by going back to the trade area
tool and selecting the option to
eliminate overlap when we run the
workflow again we can see that the
overlap is eliminated basically by
drawing a straight line on the edges
where the two radii meet getting rid of
the overlap next we'll use a spatial
match tool to find the customers the
fall within the five-mile radio around
the stores</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
