class I'm Irfan Issa and I'm a professor
here in the school of interactive
computing at the College of Computing in
Georgia Tech this is a class on computer
vision it's aimed at covering the
foundational aspects how to analyze
images and to extract content from
images that is how can we build a
computer or a machine that can see and
interpret an image first what do I mean
by foundational I mean that we're going
to cover the mathematical and
computational methods to provide you
with core concepts or how can a computer
be built to interpret images now notice
I'm using the word interpret in computer
vision we're interested in extracting
information knowledge from an image
meaning we want to go beyond processing
and image to really knowing what is
inside the image what's the content of
the image so we will learn the math and
the basic concepts how to compute with
an image and extract information from it
so this class will have lectures of
course what is a class without without
lecture all the video lectures are by my
friend and colleague Aaron Baalak I know
I'm biased but I have known Aaron for a
long time and I can tell you he's a
great lecture he actually in seriously
thinks he's funny but I guess I will let
you be the judge of that
I've known Aaron for over 20 years now
and we've both worked together I started
MIT and I learned computer vision early
days I've got at MIT also and then we
were both here at Georgia Tech for a
while until he decided recently to
become dean of engineering at the
Washington University in st. Louis
so bidding in parallel and since I
really do love this material in computer
vision I've decided to take over this
class from now on so the video lectures
are still going to be by Aaron but I
will now manage an able team of TAS and
course developers over the term and will
work with them to provide additional
material like the assignments and exams
for this term it will also be the one
you will hear from on various
communication channels with this class
so now back quickly to a bit more about
computer vision computer vision is
really about analyzing images and videos
to extract knowledge from mostly these
images are of real scenes like
that of a street image with cars and
such we're an autonomous vehicle has to
navigate through or it could be other
types of images like that of an x-ray
inside a human head and we need to do
image analysis to be able to extract
things about of interest in medical
applications so essentially the goal is
image and video understanding which
means labeling interesting things in an
image and also tracking them as they
move in this class you will learn about
the foundations of how to build systems
that can do this kind of image
understanding in addition to math and
the foundational theoretical context you
will also learn about us by doing a
series of assignments to give you real
hands-on experience with computer vision
I look forward to seeing all of you
online and engage with you as you learn
this exciting material</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
