multiply it y to the fourth times y to
the negative 2 we used our shortcut to
say that this is just equal to of course
leaving the x squared there y to the 4-2
power the role that this negative 2
exponent here plays then is that it
makes it so that in the final answer
which we know is x squared Y squared we
have two fewer wise multiplied together
than we did in at least this first part
the Y to the fourth factor of the
original expression but how do you write
Y to the negative 2 in terms of
multiplying some number of wise together
well if we know that Y to the fourth
times y to the negative 2 equals y
squared and also we remember that Y to
the fourth is for wise multiplied
together and similarly Y to the second
is to wise multiplied together this Y to
the negative 2 needs to cancel out two
of these other four wise that are
multiplied together to give us our final
answer and we know that the way that we
undo multiplication is division y to the
fourth needs to be divided by y squared
to equal Y squared we can write this out
like this we have four wise multiplied
together / 2 y's multiplied together and
each of these wise in the denominator
cancels out one of the wise in the
numerator since everything here is just
multiplied together this is how we end
up with just 2 y's multiplied together
since we can see that we only have y
times y left on the left side if we just
look at this way of writing our
expression though we can write both the
numerator and the denominator in terms
of exponents so on the top we still have
Y to the fourth and on the bottom or a
fraction we have y times y which is just
y squared so if we move this way right
our expression up here then we end up
with y to the fourth times y to the
negative 2 is equal to y to the fourth
over Y to the two we see this factor
remembering that we still need to
multiply this by our x squared to get
our final answer in this answer choice
right here y to the 4th x squared over Y
squared</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
