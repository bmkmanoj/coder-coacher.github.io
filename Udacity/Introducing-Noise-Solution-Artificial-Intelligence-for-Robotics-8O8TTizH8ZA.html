happens so before was minus three to
five seven and now the first position is
completely unchanged and explained to
you in the second why the third one went
from five to 5.5 and the landmark went
down from seven to 6.8 so graphically
this guy becomes larger than five and
the landmark even shifts a little bit to
the left to make these two things closer
together than they were before when they
had a separation distance of two now
this picture doesn't really explain as
well because it's a 2d picture but in 1d
that's exactly what's happening also
interesting the initial position is
unchanged so these are the correct
answers now I would be blown away if you
guess them correctly the reason why the
initial position doesn't change is the
only information we have about the
absolute coordinates location is the
very first initial position anchor that
we said it is to be minus three none of
the relative rubber bands change the
effect that we need this guy to be minus
three a relative strengths change
between these two things over here means
the rubber band is different but it's a
relative thing this is the only absolute
constraint we put in so clearly the
absolute location of the first position
doesn't change the reason why becomes
larger than five is well think about
rubber bands our landmark is at around
seven we believe to be a position five
in the noise free of case we just put a
tighter event between them it's not to
anymore it's now one and that means we
are inclined to move the landmark and
this position closer together and that's
exactly what happens if you go to the
solution over here the final position
becomes 5.5 so it's no 5 25 and the
laymil becomes 6.8 75 instead of seven
now this is a case where there are bands
don't end up and it's the this is one of
the places where graph slim is just
magical so before everything ended up
but we have cycles in these structures
and these cycles might not add up
because we have noise in motion those
measurements what our method does by
computing this thing Omega to the minus
1 times c we find the best solution to
the
relaxation of those rubber bands and
that to me is sheer magic</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
