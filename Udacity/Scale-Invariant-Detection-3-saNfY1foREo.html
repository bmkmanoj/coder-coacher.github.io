I'm using these regions or circles which
is scale-invariant a property that this
region would have to have is that it
should not be affected by the size and
will be the same for all corresponding
regions to build on this let's actually
kind of think about a simple example a
simple example basically says that
average intensities are interesting
things to observe for any corresponding
regions even if the object is of
different size the average intensity the
image pixel intensity in that region
will be the same so while we zoom in and
out we need to start looking at the fact
that if I do have a region in both of
those parts the average intensity of
that region if it's the same object
should be the same because as I said
it's the same object just viewed at
different scales so we resolve this by
again computing the intensities at
different scales at a point compute the
scale invariant function at different
sizes and day for different
neighborhoods and then choose the scale
for each image at which the function is
maximum let's see what that can be so
again this is the function that I'm
looking at this is my intensity and I'm
going to scale up the region size and
see where I actually find a certain peak
of course this could be done for image 1
this way and of course now I have an
image that's half the size of the object
and in the image that's half the size
again if I was to take the region size
and measure the function that changes
it'll actually have the same peak but
it'll actually be doing it much faster
just because the image is at half scale
so just basically now start saying is
that the peak and stuff like that for
this function are the same just the you
know how it impacts with the region size
so we need to start thinking about where
we can find functions like this of
course this kind of starts telling us
that we can find you know again the
scale here is important and the scale
for this one would be this these are the
two scales if I know that I should be
able to now compute where on which
region which rise size of the circle do
I want to use to look at an image for
detection of features</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
