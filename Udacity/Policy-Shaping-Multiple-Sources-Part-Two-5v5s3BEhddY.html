truly only one optimal action then as we
spend an infinite amount of time running
around in the world our notion of which
action is optimal over here if we can
convert them into actual probabilities
we'll drive whatever the optimal action
is towards one and that just comes from
all the stuff we've been talking about
with reinforcement learning for all the
time in this class if we can get to an
optimal policy by just experiencing
things in the world then eventually
these numbers will reflect that and it
doesn't matter what the human thinks the
real world will drive the correct answer
towards one so you're saying that seat
doesn't change over time C could change
over time but let's just imagine it
doesn't let's just say it's we pick a
value for C and it comes out this way if
you want to say that C changes over time
that's okay but then we're going to
answer deal with that question by having
these numbers here reflect whatever we
think C happens to be remember we can
keep track of all the labels that we've
seen and for any given value of C that
we have we can just change these numbers
appropriately okay so it sort of doesn't
matter at the time we ask this question
I've got a distribution over actions
according to the emaan i've got a
distribution of actions according to my
experience in the world it no longer
matters what I think about the human
because that is captured by this
distribution so I can just ask the
question what should I do and here you
think the answer is X yeah now what if I
had different numbers here then I still
think it's X this well now I could
certainly justify why why yeah tell me
why you think Y so okay so were you
supposed to imagine that the pi sub a is
like in the algorithm be wrong the
algorithm could be wrong but in the same
way that we don't have to worry about
what's wrong with the human because the
distribution captures it let's make the
same assumption here the agent
well this distribution is going to
capture all of our uncertainty about the
agents beliefs so maybe we'll never
actually see zero one zero but we'll see
numbers that are close enough that I'm
just going to write out zero one zero
boy there's a lot of ways to combine
these numbers together in which Y ends
up being the winner but it strikes me
that in particular you know if we
believe pi sub a then pi sub a is
absolutely certain that it's Y so it
almost doesn't matter at this point what
PI sub H thinks what
human things mm-hmm and by the way by
the same argument if it's the case that
C is equal to one for the human that the
human is infallible then it really is
not going to matter what the agent
thinks because the humans infallible
well unless they enlist they disagree
but then we have to really believe that
probability was correct right either the
probability is correct or it's incorrect
and for the purposes of answering this
question let's just say the
probabilities are correct insofar as
they are not it'll be reflected by these
distributions so we could never have one
zero zero on the top row and then zero
one zero on the bottom row because that
just violates the laws of reality right
so you would argue for why what I think
that you've been using intuition so far
and I want you to do a little bit more
than intuition so I'm going to do that
