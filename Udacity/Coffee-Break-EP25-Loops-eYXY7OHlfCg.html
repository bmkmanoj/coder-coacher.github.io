hurt yourself on the last one you're on
you're on your way okay hey I'm Sarah
I'm a course developer here at Udacity i
recently helped to develop the course
introduction to programming with java
which teaches some basic programming
skills with programming you can do
repetitive tasks that would otherwise be
really boring here's the student talking
about four loops I think that the best
way to understand why you should learn
how to use a for loop is with an analogy
I have to move 10 heavy boxes wouldn't
it be cool if I can move one box and
then somehow my action was repeated nine
more times for me instead of me having
to pick up ten boxes and move them
physically by myself that's kind of what
four loops do for you you write
something once you make sure it works
once and then as long as you use it
properly it does the work for you again
and again and Ewan void your code
getting messy and heavy I hope you
enjoyed that clip and if you have any
repetitive tasks you want to get out of
the way in the future I hope that you'll
think about taking introduction to
programming with java</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
