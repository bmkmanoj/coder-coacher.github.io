create simple movement just to a ball
moving around in a circle the first
thing we need to do is set up some
constants that determine what the
movement of the ball looks like
including how many seconds the ball
should take to go all the way through
one cycle then we need to store the time
at which the application adapter was
created by declaring a long called
initial time and then setting it equal
to time utils nano time in the create
callback now down in the render call
back we can figure out how long it's
been since the game started running by
subtracting the initial time from the
current value of time utils Anna time
this gives the number of nanoseconds
that the game has been running but
seconds would be a lot more convenient
libgdx provides a very nice math utils
nano to SEC constant to help with that
conversion now we need to figure out
where in the cycle where at if we take
the elapsed seconds and divide it by the
period we get the number of elapsed
periods since the game started running
we can then take the modulus with one to
determine what fractional part of a
cycle has elapsed so we now have a
number that counts up from 0 to 1 and
then reset back to 0 and we need to map
that interval to a position on a circle
don't suppose you remember the
parametric equation of a circle you can
check out the link in the instructor
notes for a short refresher on some
trigonometry to figure out the
exposition of our ball we take the
center point of the world and then we
add the movement radius times the cosine
of the cycle position x 2 pi for the y
position it's almost identical except
we're taking the sign instead of the
cosine and there we go we've achieved
circular movement even with something so
simple as balls and moving in circles we
can make some surprisingly beautiful
patterns check out what we can do with
20 balls each moving at a different
harmonic speed</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
