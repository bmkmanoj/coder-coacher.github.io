one for each service front end off and
hello them will defy internal services
for the off and hello deployments and an
external service for the front end the
plant
let's examine the deployment
configuration file the first thing I'm
going to do is specify the number of
replicas this deployment can be used the
scale pods by changing the replica count
in our manifest moving on
you can see the labels that will be
attached to the off pods a little
further down you'll see we're using
version window of off container use the
coo CTO correct command to create the
off deployment as with any other
companies object we can use the
described command to see more
information about the off deployment ok
it's now time to create a service for
deployment you've already seen service
manifest files so i won't go into
details here use the coop CTL correct
command to create the off service now
I'm going to do the same thing to create
an expose the hello deployment and
wanted to repeat these steps one more
time for the front and employment will
also need to configure engine next like
we did in the previous tutorial now we
are ready to interact with the front end
by grabbing his external IP address and
using curl to hit congratulations you
deployed a multi-service application
using cover Nettie's the skills you've
learned here will allow you to deploy
complex applications on communities
using a collection of deployments and
services</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
