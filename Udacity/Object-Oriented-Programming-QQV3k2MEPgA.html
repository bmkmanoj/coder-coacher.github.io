say is you need to know how to create
classes before you go ahead starting
your Frogger game so specifically this
type of classes is called the prototypal
classes so prototype classes what they
can do is they have a set of attributes
or properties and our member functions
associated with it so um let me just
share my screen now so I'm going to open
up sublime and I'm going to teach you
guys how to start typing up a very
simple prototype of class let's define a
class in Java Script so I'm going to use
the same so in JavaScript when you
define a class it should always start
with a capital letter your class name
should have a capital letter so that is
what what distinguishes a class a
function and an object in JavaScript
because essentially the three of them
have the same arm but syntax or how you
define them is the same so what I'm
going to do is I'm going to go ahead and
create a class and call it person and
I'm going to pass in a name parameter
into my class so inside this what i can
do is i can access the name attribute or
assign an attribute to the name property
by using this one keyword so that this
keyword is going to tell me the object
that is actually invoke a ting the
person class so the object is going to
be an instance off the person class so
this is what I defined here what I'm
essentially doing is any object I create
I assign the object an attribute of name
and then I give it the name that
we passin while instantiating the object
this will also be called as the
constructor of the class as you know in
other languages so yeah so what i'm
doing here is i'm actually creating a
prototype function so a prototype
function is what it is is it's going to
essentially create a member function of
your class so this function display is
going to be associated with the person
class and it can be accessed by an
instance of the person class so the
technique for that is going to be person
dot prototype display equals function
off i'm passing a greeting message which
might be just a name so what i'm going
to do is I'm just going to console dot
log code into this you guys can figure
out what could type into your game later
and then I'm just going to add appended
greeting to my name that I will assign
this dot name so as you can see i
created a prototype function display I'm
associated with this also I can actually
create another function I can call an
object new person i can create it and i
can call the constructor this way and
then i'm going to pass in my name into
it so what this is essentially doing is
it's create an instance off the class
person and assigning the name foo nema
to it and whenever this object you do
this it's going to this is going to
return person dot name will return porn
Iman um and then so now if I want to
call the display function all I have to
do is new underscore person and then I
can say good evening so the result of
the new display function should be good
evening purnima so that's what it's
going to do so as you can see these are
prototypal classes you will be using a
lot of this in your JavaScript Frogger
game is there a better way of saving
states ok savings states for your
theater objective like an enum variable
that defines various states of the
player um I know that if you have a
state where the player is alive the
player is still playing when you go to
lick when you progress through levels
you need to have um you know several
enum stages in your player type so it's
called an enumeration data type so what
you can do is you can have a list of
states for your player declared within
the enumeration data type um it's going
to be just like an array it's very
similar to an area where you can assign
these sort of like values to it and
always enum datatypes take are in the
form of caps lock that define the state
of a player um so feel free to use that
and use some leverage that data type to
actually define what stage your player
is currently in and what's changing want
to transition you're there too um so
that's one thing you can look at
designing your states with so maybe we
could talk a little bit about how these
concepts that the students are learning
could be so we're applying the
object-oriented concepts your game I
think from a game sense it makes a lot
of sense right right there's player and
he's an object enemies and you want to
kind of create multiple instances of
these enemies so having sort of this
object oriented design makes sense right
now when would we see this in sort of an
actual website so if I'm going to like
say ESPN google any other sort of the
websites that i visit we're on like a
page or you see where could we utilize
these object-oriented design concepts
yes so they could really be used in a
lot of these
since is one of the the common ones that
you'll see out there as kind of an inch
intro to java script development is that
to do list at everyone's built it to do
this step you know over and over a
hundred times I'll if you think about it
a to-do list item is pretty simple if
you think about the properties of it is
it checked or not mm-hmm and what is the
text of that to do list item so i could
easily envision a page that has like a
box at the top that you type stuff in
and then just a series of items each of
those items would be an object and so
then I would have I'm thinking about the
prototype of that of that to-do item
let's imagine we have a class of to-do
list item some of the prototype
functions I would have is edit because
that functionality isn't distinct or
unique between all of these items
everyone edits the same way able to edit
all right arm checking and unchecking
when you want to maybe you have a
counter that updates so but they're
checking and unchecking functionality of
that to-do item is gonna be the same
across every single one mm-hmm so it
really comes down to shared
functionality mom as we mentioned in
object-oriented JavaScript course
there's not there's not a right way to
do it and that's kind of the what I
enjoy about javascript is that it just
depends on the implementation we can't
tell you you know always use a
functional class or always use a pseudo
classical class it really depends on
what you're trying to do and what you're
trying to accomplish and I know that
sounds difficult and frustrating right
now but it'll it'll come in time and
that's one of my favorite things about
javascript is I kind of compared to
Tetris it's really easy to play but hard
to master yeah and that's how javascript
is is it's easy to get stuff done and
then a week later you're gonna learn
something new and realize that all I can
make that better what I did last week
and it's a constant oh I can make what I
just did a lot better</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
