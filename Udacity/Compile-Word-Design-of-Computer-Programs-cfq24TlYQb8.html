works this have actually typed in to the
Python interpreter I've defined a
function f as a lambda expression looks
like this then I've asked what F is all
Python prints out it says that it's a
object of type function which doesn't
have a name other than the lambda and
the address in memory where's it's
stored and then I'd say is F true of the
sequence 1 2 3 4 5 that is y is equal to
1 m 2 e is 3 U is 4 and O is 5 the
answer is no it's false this is not
equal and then I asked is it true for 2
1 7 9 8 yes that's true and the reason
is because it works out to this
expression 289 equals 17 squared now I'm
thinking of a design where we have some
type of a solve function that's going to
solve a formula and we're gonna have a
compile formula function that's going to
take a string formula as input and
return a lambda expression function as
the result of compiling the formula and
as part of that I want to have a
function that I'm going to call compile
word and it's going to take a word like
me and compile that into something like
10 M plus e and you could have some
variation on exactly how you want to
express that and it will also take a
word like equals and compile that into
itself into equals and a word like 2 and
compile that into 2 itself so this is
the function I want you to write
compiled word where compiled word of
view is something like this don't worry
about the community and associativity
you can write this any way you want as
long as it is a code that would compute
the right answer it's important to put
parentheses around it anything that's
not an uppercase word you should leave
alone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
