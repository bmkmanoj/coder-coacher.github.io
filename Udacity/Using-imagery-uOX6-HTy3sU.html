personalize the experience of using your
app or provide delight your use of
imagery will strongly reflect and
reinforce your branding so if your brand
is bold and dynamic then use imagery in
the same way if your brand is playful
and informal there may be a more
illustrative style if your chic and
refined then tell that story visually
but what types of imagery can you use
and when are they appropriate the major
classes of imagery you can use for
somewhere on a spectrum from photography
through illustration to iconography
let's take a look at each of these and
when they might be appropriate now
photography is great when it's specific
to your content if you're showing
information about a particular person
place or thing then photography can
quickly and beautifully communicate that
conversely if your content is more
abstract we don't have imagery specific
to the content then photography might
feel off the mark here in this example I
was showing details of the London Eye
and then having a specific picture works
very well but if you're showing
information about another place here
Waterloo station which is near the
underline but not the same place then
the image doesn't connect in the same
way and it feels off as another example
if I'm showing content from other people
like this messaging type app then
showing a photo of the contacts
immediately communicates far better than
a label or generic graphic might when
presenting photography make sure you
have sufficient quality images to avoid
pixilation if you do have great quality
imagery then don't be shy about using
immersively it's perfectly acceptable to
use imagery as a backdrop to set the
mood of a screen always consider the
different ways that images might be
cropped depending on different layouts
or size of the device think about the
aspect ratios scale types and focal
points that it's important to maintain
we're going to go into much more detail
about this later on in lesson 5
illustration is great for communicating
abstract concepts or metaphors without
getting hung up on the specificity that
comes from photography take these three
examples the first to communicate the
concepts of syncing photos or doing a
brain training game
without the specific images of people
the last image helps onboard users
without having to have imagery for every
specific device when creating
illustration aim for clarity instead of
being overly decorative have a focal
point and a message that you're trying
to communicate while the exact style of
the illustration is up to you and your
brand do try to stay consistent within a
series of illustrations to keep them
connected for example using a consistent
perspective color palette or use of
textures iconography provides clear
wayfinding its goals are almost the
exact opposite of illustration to
succinctly explain their meaning and get
out of the way they should be easy to
identify and interpret in your UI for
this reason it's best to use the
platform iconography for common tasks
such as search or share as your users
will already be familiar with them
material design provides a wide range of
icons that you can use in your
application for creating new icons then
check out the extensive style guide
which is linked in the instructor notes
and there's a great community starting
to pop up and create more icons in the
same style at material design icons calm
so those were the main types of imagery
you can use in your app picking the
right one really depends upon the feel
of your brand and the content you're
showing no matter what type of imagery
you use it will help to create an
immersive experience and can be a great
way to introduce motion for example this
music player eases the transition
between states and has an incredibly
immersive feel through its use of
imagery the images themselves can
introduce motion using videos scrolling
effects like parallax or other types of
animation will expand on using motion in
Lesson four once you've picked the
imagery that works best for your brand
you can use it to make your application
experiences more immersive personal and
delightful let's hand over to James now
and get into how you implement this in
your app</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
