combination that leaves the most
warfarin around to have a maximum effect
vkorc1 is involved in the
pharmacodynamic response so if we have
less of it around then there's more war
front of vkorc1 so we can saturate our
vkorc1 faster with less BRC one around
SIPTU c9 represents the pharmacokinetic
aspect of warfarin because it
metabolizes or breaks warfarin down well
if sip 2c9 is slow then that means we're
going to end up with more warfarin
around and vitamin K is downstream in
the pathway and since vitamin K itself
promotes blood clotting which is the
opposite of what warfarin is trying to
do if we have low to no vitamin K no
leafy greens in this case then we don't
need as much warfarin to block the
effects of the vitamin K recycling that
promote blood clotting Seoul s BQ rc1 a
slow or reduced activity for sip 2c9 and
low to no vitamin K supplemented in
other ways now in your explanation that
you tried to write out to justify your
combination hopefully you recognize that
the pharmacodynamic or PD pathway was
with vkorc1 the pharmacokinetic pathway
was with sip 2c9 and that a max toxicity
essentially is maximizing the
pharmacodynamic pathway and minimizing
the pharmacokinetic pathway if we wanted
an optimum efficacy minimum toxicity we
would have to be somewhere in the middle
that allows warfarin to achieve its
function of blocking some amount of
blood clotting but not so much that it
promotes bleeding so recognizing that
this combination is not what we want is
really one of the first major steps to
understanding what the right
prescription is</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
