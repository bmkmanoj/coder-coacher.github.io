software architecture it seemed
appropriate to start the lesson by
asking a world expert on this topic what
is software architecture and why it is
important to do that let's fly to
California and more precisely to Los
Angeles and visit professor Nino
Medvedev each hi I'm Kara visiting
professor Nineveh village from the
University of Southern California and
Nino is one of the world experts in
software architecture actually the one
of the author's own of a recent book
which is sort of the book in software
architecture and what I'd like to
discuss with Nino is the concept of
software architecture and its importance
because people are very familiar with
the idea and the concept of design and
software architecture is something is
very related to that but it's less known
so I would like for an Nino to elaborate
on that and tell us why is it important
to focus on so on the specific you know
architectural aspects of a software when
you build any software system even a
simple relatively simple one you're
going to go through a process of making
many many design decisions hundreds or
thousands sometimes even tens of
thousands of design decisions so any
program that you write at some point you
get to deciding what the interface of a
particular method is going to be are you
going to put in a parameter that is an
integer or a float when you're writing a
routine of some sort you have to decide
whether you're going to use a static
data structure or a dynamic data
structure all these things are design
decisions many of them however will
typically in the average case not really
impact the success of your system and
the long-term well-being of your system
but typically the things that software
engineers start struggling with our
other design decisions design decisions
that are the equivalent of load-bearing
walls in a building these are the things
that if you don't get them right or if
you compromise them will in fact
potentially impact how the system
operates they might result in failures
of different kinds they may result in a
system that is not easily maintainable
and so forth in a sense to make the long
story short architectural design
decisions are really the principal
design decisions in your system these
are the things that are very important
all the other design decisions you could
sort of tagged with as being important
but they're sort of below this very
important or highly important threshold
so if you need to change a low level
design decision sometimes it's kind of
easy to do in my change the data
structure is it the case that you know
being that the architecture sort of the
pillar of the software is that going to
be much more difficult to change an
architectural decision and detector is
thing to be know if you start with the
wrong girl key textured the software's
going you know necessarily be
unsuccessful or you can also do
something in that respect a system could
be successful and very poorly
architected just like a building or an
airplane or car any other engineering
artifact could be successful but poorly
architected so success we can separate
from this but the point that you make in
asking this question is an important one
the non architectural design decisions
should be on the average there are
exceptions and we need to acknowledge
that there is no one size fits all type
of solution for anything in software
engineering really but on the average
the non architectural design decisions
should be much easier to make so the
scale of the consequences of making such
a change really can vary from very minor
highly localized to very important and
sometimes even system-wide to conclude I
just like to ask you about some concept
that is we hear about a lot which is
architectural erosion since we are
talking about you know define
architectures and software evolution so
what is exactly architectural erosion
why does that happen so to go back to
our non-software metaphors imagine you
buy a car and your car has four wheels
it has a steering wheel it has a nice
chassis it looks pretty nice at one
point you end up replacing its hundred
and fifty horsepower engine with a 250
horsepower because that's what you want
and you start putting a spoiler on the
back of the car and then you replace the
headlights and then you replace the side
view mirrors with smaller ones because
you want your car to be more aerodynamic
and you start tinkering with other
things like you cut the maybe the roof
of the car because you want to turn it
into a convertible etc and in the end
what you have is a car that you still
your car looks very different its
structural and behavioral
these are very different and what you
might find is that the car doesn't
handle nearly as well for example in a
very sharp turn it might not be able to
negotiate a steep hill as well because
you've pretty much changed it all along
the way architectural erosion in the
case of a software system is the exact
same thing would one huge caveat very
few if any of us will ever put a new
engine into our car or tinker with the
structural soundness of the car by
cutting off the roof etc in a software
system we do it all the time we'll add a
feature will change one bit of the unit
user interface here will port it to a
new platform some kind of a mobile
platform for example and pretty soon
what you end up with is really a
software system that is maybe a distant
relative of your original system it is a
mutant in many ways because oftentimes
these little tinkering happen on a
one-off basis there is no overarching
vision for how you should do this so you
are basically going through a subsequent
set of steps where you're making locally
optimal decisions for any one of these
changes and what you might end up
finding is that the globally optimal
behavior of the system is badly
compromised the structural soundness in
a sense of the system is badly
compromised the non functional
properties of the system could be
seriously affected this is how security
flaws creep into systems this is our
reliability flaws this is how the
usability of a system oftentimes suffers
and most importantly for software
engineers the people who actually build
the software the maintainability of the
system becomes a huge problem because
now you're looking at this thing it's
got all these various appendages its
original design has pretty badly eroded
and yet somehow you have to figure out
how to keep fixing it making sure that
it operates in a continuous fashion
because many of these systems live for
20 34 years thank you so much for your
insight is a perfect introduction for
our lesson so we'll get to the lesson
now and thank you very much thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
