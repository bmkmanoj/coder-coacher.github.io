multiple predictors and combine their
decisions suppose that we have a program
in which a two bit predictor which is
fine for 95% of our instructions ap
share predictor which is fine for the
same 95 percent of the instructions plus
it also works fine for 2 percent that
this 2 bit predictor doesn't cover so
overall it works fine for 97 percent of
all instructions but the 95 percent here
in here overlap a gshare predictor again
works just fine for the same 95 percent
that all the other predictors are just
fine for + it works fine for the other 3
percent so overall it's 98% accurate 95
of those are the same as the 2 bit
predictor but the three that it covers
in addition to that are not the same but
the three that it covers in addition to
that are different from the 2 percent
that the pichia predictor covers so
together these three predictors should
be able to correctly predict all
instructions so the question for you is
how do we combine them so the overall
predictor that we will use is a what
kind of predictor the chooses between a
what kind of predictor and what kind of
predictor and this last predictor here
itself will choose between what kind and
what kind predictor instead of writing
in the names of the predictors just
select among the following so for each
of them say if it's a b c d or e a is
the two bit predictor b is the picture
predictor see is the gshare predictor d
is the tournament predictor e is a
hierarchical predictor and F is the
return address stack so again for each
of these five boxes put which letter
corresponds to the predictor that is the
right answer for that box</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
