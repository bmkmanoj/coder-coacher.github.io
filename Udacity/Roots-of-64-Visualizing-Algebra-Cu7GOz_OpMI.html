you got those three correct now we
haven't seen something like this third
one before so don't worry if they give
you trouble for the first one I'm going
to have power divided by root so 64 to
the one from my power and I take a
square root since the denominator is at
two so here I really have the square
root of sixty-four which we know is 8
and if I think about rewriting this I
can see all the intermediate steps we
can take to get there we rewrite 64 as 8
squared and now since we have a square
root in a square we can use power
divided by root we have eight to the 2/2
which is really just a to the 1 or eight
now these steps here are not necessary
in order to get to our final answer if
we understand the square root of
sixty-four is 8 that's great I just want
to reinforce that we can use our same
idea of power divided by root to
simplify we use similar reasoning for
the second problem we know that we have
power divided by root so 64 to the one
for our power and then three for our
route a cube root we know the cube root
of sixty-four is four and we can rewrite
64 s 4 cubed and use power divided by
root to simplify again this part isn't
necessary if we know the cube root of
sixty-four is for this is one of the
ones on our list of perfect cubes for
this third one we're going to have the
cube root of sixty-four squared this is
our power of 2 and this is our root of
three we know the cube root of
sixty-four is simply for so we're going
to have 4 squared this gives us a final
result of 16 now you might have done
this problem differently you might have
squared the 64 first we could have also
written our power inside of the radical
first and then taking the cube root if
we square 64 will get 4096 and it turns
out the cube root of 4096 is still 16 so
in terms of doing a root first or an
exponent first it doesn't matter usually
it's easiest to take the route first
since we can get a smaller number here
and then square it this is much harder
since I wouldn't really know the cube
root of 4096 off the top of my head and
in fact I
definitely don't</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
