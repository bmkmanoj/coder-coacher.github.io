unsupervised learning
I'm supervised learning is something
that's very important because most of
the time the data that you get in the
real world doesn't have little flags
attached that tell you the correct
answer
so what are you to do as a machine
learner in that case you turn to
unsupervised techniques to still figure
something out about that data okay let's
talk about them given a data set without
labels over all the data points are of
the same class there are sometimes still
things you can do to extract useful
information like this data set over here
we I would say this data set is
structured in a way that is useful to
recognize for machine learning algorithm
when we look at this by eye it looks
like there's clumps or clusters in the
data and if we could identify those
clumps or clusters we could maybe say
something about a new unknown data point
and what its neighbors might be like
well here's a second example of data
maybe the data looks just like this
there's something you can see here as
well right so all the data in this
example looks like it lives on some kind
of line or some complicated shape that
your seem to be drawing in there right
now
yeah and it's used to be a
two-dimensional space with x and y over
here but some of you can reduce it to a
one-dimensional lines so it's called
what that's called dimensionality
reduction imagine analogy reduction so
you lose about a little bit of
clustering clustering is what we'll
learn in this lesson and you see an
example of something also called
unsupervised learning of dimensionality
reduction which we will get in a future
lesson so these kind of things very fine
structure in the data without labels
they are called unsupervised learning
even I'm going to dive into the
wonderful wonderful magical land of
unsupervised learning sounds great let's
dive in</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
