the algorithm behave let's have a closer
look at it the first three lines here
are independent of the structure of the
input so if you look at them the counter
is set to zero we go through a range and
then we look if the letter that we're
currently at is an A those are
independent of what kind of string we're
looking at will always be executing
these parts of the code but for those
two parts here that's kind of different
so this line here which is the fourth
line so this line here will only be
executed if we have encountered a day
and this line here will only be executed
if we have encountered an A then the
next character is a B so how often these
two lines here are executed is dependent
on the structure of the input now in a
worst case input we would want these two
lines to get executed as often as
possible and in a best-case scenario
we would want them to get executed the
least possible number of times so what
we can already say is that a best-case
input will cause these two lines here to
never be called and that only happens if
the string does not contain the letter A
at all which is the one down here so for
the other strings let's just go through
the algorithm and count how many times
this line here is executed and how many
times this this line down here is
executed so if the string looks like a B
a B a B and so on then every time that
the algorithm encounters an A it will
execute this line down here and it will
also execute this line down here because
the next letter is a B now when it
encounters a B it will not execute this
line and it will not execute this line
then it encounters an A again so this
line will be executed and this line will
be executed then again those two won't
be then we have them both again then
zero times and so on so basically for
every two letters that it encounters it
will execute these two lines
so two lines per two letters makes one
extra line per letter
now for the second string what happens
is this the algorithm and carries an A
so it will execute this line but the
next letter is not a B so it will not
execute that line down here then it goes
on to the next letter and again it
encounters an A so this line here will
be executed but not this one down here
because the next letter again is not an
A so as the algorithm progresses it
executes one extra line per letter just
as the string above now finally if the
algorithm encounters AC AC AC what will
happen is this first the algorithm
encounters an a so it executes this line
down here but then it does not encounter
a B so it will not go into this line
next letter the algorithm and caris SC
so it will not execute this line down
here and so on I think you get the
picture so this is not one extra line
per letter but it will only be 0.5 so it
already tells us that this string here
is not a worst-case string it's
something in between now those two
strings because they both require the
same amount of time are either both
worst case or they're both something in
between
now this is something where you just
have to look closely at the algorithm to
see that a worst case input is among
others one that contains as many times
the letters a B as possible which is
exactly this string so there's no word
strings to encounter for this algorithm
so this one is the worst case input but
surprisingly also this one down here
although it doesn't contain the sequence
a B at all is also a worst case input
even now that we have introduced a
number of simplifications we have
introduced the RAM as a simplified
computer model to count the number of
time steps and we've also said that
we're just going to look at worst-case
running time you see that the analysis
of algorithms can still be quite tedious
it's sometimes hard to identify what
exactly a worst-case input will be and
even if we know the worst-case input
finding the exact formula for the
running time is very difficult which is
why we're going to introduce another
simplify
occasion to state running time and that
simplification is known as Big O
