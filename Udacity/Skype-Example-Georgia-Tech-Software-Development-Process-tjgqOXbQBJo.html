Napster I'm pretty sure that most of you
know and use Skype a voice over IP and
instant messaging service many of you
however probably don't know how Skype
works to understand that let's have a
look at skype architecture which I'm
sketching here and which is a
peer-to-peer architecture with a small
twist so first of all by looking at the
architecture we can see the worst
Napster was a client-server system with
an element of peer-to-peer Skype is a
much more decentralized system why is
that well if we look here we can see
that there is a login server okay this
is not over here and that means that
every Skype user has to register with
this centralized service but that's the
only interaction of this kind within
Skype after you login all you get is a
connection through a super node like
this one so what are super nodes super
nodes are highly reliable nodes with
high bandwidth that are not behind a
firewall that runs Skype regularly which
means that note that shutdown Skype
occasionally will not qualify as super
nodes and one interesting thing about
super nodes is that they are not owned
by Skype they're just regular nodes that
get promoted by Skype to super nodes and
that know about each other
so basically Skype has an algorithm that
look at the nodes in the system and
decide whether a node can be a super
node or not based on its characteristics
so now that we discussed super nodes
let's see what will happen if pr2 wanted
to communicate with peer 3 so let's
represent this by creating a dashed line
between peer 2 and peer 3 in this case
peer to will contact its super node
which is super node a and super not a
based on its knowledge of the Skype
network and the position of the super
nodes will contact and wrap the
communication through super Nazi which
will in turn rather communication to
peer 3 and in this way P 2 and P 3 will
be able to communicate with each other
and this will happen just as if P 2 and
P 3 were connected directly as peers
even though the communication goes
through two super nodes another thing
that is important to know about the
behavior of Skype is that if the link
between super nodes a and C were to go
down so let's assume that there is a
problem with this link then Skype will
automatically or automatically reroute
the communication so super not
B which would in turn reroute it to
super Nazi which will again reroute to
Pier three so Pier two and three will
still be connected but this time they
will be going through three super nodes
and just in case you wonder this is
exactly what happens when you are
talking over Skype the quality of the
communication degrades and you are
reconnected so there is this rerouting
going on through different nodes so
thought ease architecture is more
effective than the Napster's one it is
not without problems for example you
might remember then a few years ago
Skype went down for about 36 hours and
later on it was discovered that the
cause was the algorithm used by Skype to
determine which nodes could be super
nodes and remember as I said that one
requirement for these nodes is that they
have to be up all the time so what
happened is that most of the super nodes
were running on Windows machines and
Microsoft pushed the critical patch that
required a reboot to be installed so a
large number of machines and therefore a
large number of super nodes were down
roughly at the same time throughout the
globe and skypes
algorithm for determining super nodes
didn't have enough nodes to work with so
the whole system crashed and burned so
the message I want to give here is that
when you have a large peer-to-peer
distributed systems such as this one
such as Skype this kind of perfect
storms can happen because you are not
really in control because the control is
distributed so the algorithms become
more complex so to wrap up our skype
example in case you're interested Skype
then fix the issue by changing the
algorithm for identifying super nodes
and more recently actually Skype at
ditched peer-to-peer super nodes
altogether</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
