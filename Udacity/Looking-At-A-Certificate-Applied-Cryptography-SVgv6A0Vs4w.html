want to demonstrate what happens when we
connect using TLS in the browser and
different browsers deal with TLS in
different ways if we connect to https
google com well that's using SSL to
connect we can see in the address bar
it's indicating that it's a secure
connection if we click on that we can
see more information about that we're
connected to the site google com unknown
who it's run by and it's verified by a
certificate provided by thought
consulting limited and we can click on
this to get more information about that
key this has information about the
certificate and we can click on the
certificate to see what it was it says
our communication between the site is
now being encrypted as a result of the
handshake protocol the client and the
server have agreed on a key and now all
the messages between our client and the
server are encrypted using that key if
we look at the certificate well we see
more information about how that was
established and we have an ssl server
certificate it indicates who it was
issued to so it was issued to www google
com that matches the name of the site we
connected to and it explains who issued
the certificate and it has fingerprints
for the certificate we can also see that
it has an expiration date certificates
don't last forever that's an important
property if the certificate lasted
forever we'd have to have a very strong
encryption on it by making it expire the
key lengths needed for the certificate
can be predicted based on expected
coudn't computing power until the
expiration time we can see more if we
look at the details and this is where we
get into the real issue of how the
certificate work that there's a chain of
authorities that validate the
certificate and we'll talk about that
more soon and then look at this again</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
