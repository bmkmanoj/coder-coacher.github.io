are that's the biometric method so what
exactly is that so obviously they have
variety of biometrics and it should be
unique to you somebody else you don't be
able to use a biometric feature or set
of features to impersonate you so what
are some examples fingerprints are one
you swipe your finger for example the
touch ID and things like that and they
look for the pattern in your
fingerprints and based on that this is
really you and it comes to keyboard if
nothing else the way you type or the
keystroke dynamics you know how fast you
are how long you take from one cue to
the next depending what the keys are and
things like that sometimes that is used
as biometric features the right from you
know the speed at which you type or
pattern of your typing could be a
biometric that's unique to you actually
seeing devices that do voice biometric
authentication they extract a set of
features from your voice which hopefully
is unique to you and that can be used
when you talk to the device it knows
that it's really you and of course
they're more intrusive and fancier one
like retinal scans and things like that
which look for sort of unique pattern
based on and the blood flow in your eye
and things like that so these are
basically what you are the way these
work is that you're going to claim it to
you and you're going to swipe your
finger or you talk in case of voice but
the biometric measurement should be the
same each time if it's different then of
course we're going to have a a false
negative isn't it it's you but you're
not able to log in but because you have
a cold and your voice a little different
so maybe you don't have exact these
measurements maybe you have a
probability distribution for your the
features that we extract from your
biometric measurements and of course
we're going to have false positives and
false negatives as we have with each
authentication method that we discussed
here if your biometric measurements
change beyond a certain limit and of
course you may not be able to login
resulting in this false negative that
we're talking about so the basic way of
implementing biometric is there has to a
biometric sensor there's some user
interface where you swipe your finger
or camera takes a picture of you or or
you talk to it or whatever it is that
the interface the sensor then from the
biometric reading we're going to extract
a bunch of features that actually
describe the reading that we just have
from the sensor and there has two
biometric database that stores these
features or something derived from these
features so pin is here is sort of a
separate thing we may have in addition
to finish something you know so that's
the secret but so if you just sort of
going with biometric you you would not
have the top line here so the biometric
database essentially like a pash values
for passwords we have something that
describes the biometric feature set and
feature values for a given user so once
you extract the feature we compare those
if there is a match between these two
then we allow authentication if there
isn't a match then we're going to say
authentication is not allowed so the
idea is that you still have the
enrollment problem somebody has to have
a description of your biometric features
which is the database where we storing
it the sensor has to read it the
features have to be extracted the
comparison or matt has to happen and
that's how while metric authentication
works so rather than you typing a
password we sort of reading it through
the interface in the sensor and then
it's sort of similar to what we had
before</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
