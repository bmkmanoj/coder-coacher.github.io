all of these are read and write accesses
there's nothing special about them this
is this is going to be modifying data
using loads and stores and this is
storing a value into it and this is
reading a value and is using a value so
all of these are normal read read
accesses
but there is a difference between the
way the program uses this flag variable
versus this data structure the flag
variable is being used as a
synchronization variable and that's a
secret that only this p1 and p2 know
about that this even though innocuously
looks like a simple integer variable
that is used in a program but it is
special semantics for this particular
variable so far as this program is
concerned P will in p2 know that this is
the way by which they're signalling each
other that as something that this guy's
waiting on is available from p1 right
and so it's a synchronization variable
on the other hand the the data structure
a is a normal data but both accessing
the synchronization variable and normal
data is being accomplished by simple
read write accesses that's available in
the processor and that's how we're able
to get the solution for this particular
question it's comforting to know that
atomic read and write operations are
good for doing simple coordination among
processes as we illustrated through this
question and in fact when we look at
certain implementation of barrier
algorithms later on you'll find that
this is all that is needed from the
architecture in order to implement some
of them but now how about implementing a
synchronization primitives like a mutual
exclusion lock our atomic reads and
writes sufficient to implement a
synchronization primitive like a mutual
explosion lock let's investigate that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
