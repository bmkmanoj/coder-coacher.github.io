aggregation framework is designed to
allow you to create a data processing
pipeline as we've seen several times now
you can include as many stages as you
need in order to achieve a goal for each
stage you just need to consider what
input that stage needs to receive and
what output it needs to produce now what
I want to talk about here is the fact
that many tasks require us to use more
than one stage with the same operator
for example we frequently need multiple
group stages in order to achieve our
goal so let's look at another example
this time I really want you to consider
each stage individually and just think
about the inputs and outputs we're going
to do a tweak on our original question
of user mentions and this time we're
going to look at who has mentioned the
most unique users so in the same way
that we looked at unique hashtags just a
minute ago now we're going to look at
modifying this pipeline so that we are
only counting mentions of users not
already accounted for in our grouping so
here's the code for this we have our
same unwind stage as before but the
group stage is different and you'll
notice that there's another unwind stage
here and another group stage here in the
first group stage what we're doing is
aggregating still on the user's screen
name but rather than simply summing up
all of the documents that this group
stage received in order to calculate all
the user mentions because of course
unwind is going to generate one document
for every user mention instead what
we're going to do here is use the add to
set operator that we looked at just a
couple of minutes ago now what we're
paying attention to here is the screen
name for the user that was actually
mentioned in the tweet so we're
accumulating an array here in this group
stage of a unique set of users mentioned
in tweets produced by this user or by
each user okay but that doesn't get us
what we want because again remember our
question is who has mentioned the most
unique users okay so to this point all
we have is a list of unique users
we haven't counted them yet now in order
to do that what we're going to need to
do is think about what's the output from
this group stage well the output is
going to be exactly what we defined here
as the structure of documents coming out
of this all documents will have an
underscore ID field which will be the
username that forms the basis for the
grouping that that document represents
and there will be this M set filled our
mentions set okay so this stage here
will receive documents with an
underscore ID field and an M set field
so what that means is that we can use
unwind again here and produce one
document for every item in this array
and again remember this is going to be
an array of unique elements because we
use the add to set operator to produce
it so unwind then we'll generate one
document for every item found in the M
set field for each document in its input
so this stage then we'll unwind this
array of unique user mentions and pass
those along to this second group stage
and it's this group stage where we end
up calculating the count that we want so
instead of just counting all user
mentions as we did before here instead
what we're going to do is now count
those unique mentions that get passed
along to us here after unwinding the M
set array okay so the documents done
that we pass along from this second
group stage to sort are going to contain
an ID this is just a copying over
essentially of the ID that we got as
input to this stage which is going to be
the ID that was produced here at this
stage and then we're simply counting how
many documents that I receive that have
that ID or how many unique user mentions
did I receive for the specific user okay
then we're simply going to sort based on
the count field in descending order as
we've been doing through most of our
examples and finally here I'm going to
limit it to ten so we can actually see
what the counts are for unique user
mentions for the top ten tweeters okay
so let's run this okay
so we can see the names of the users and
their respective number of unique user
mentions
