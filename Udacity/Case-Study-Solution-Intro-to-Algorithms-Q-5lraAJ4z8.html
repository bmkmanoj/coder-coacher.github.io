back to the code for a moment and we'll
even put in an example just to see what
it actually does you should have already
done this but just in case you haven't
let's run this and see what it does so
we put in four and five it came out with
twenty that actually should be enough
for you to figure out which of the
answers that I gave you is correct it's
clearly computing the product of these
two at least in this example but why in
general is that what it's doing so let's
actually take a look at the code and see
what happens so we start off with a and
B we leave them alone but we put copies
of them into X and y and we have a Z
variable that we initialize to zero and
then what we're going to do is we're
gonna keep decrementing X keep
subtracting one from X until it hits
zero and each time we subtract one from
X we add y into Z so we're starting off
with Z is zero and we add Y to it how
many times x times so Z at the end of
this is y add it to itself x times X
times y so it is in fact computing the
product of these now that was kind of an
informal argument can we be a little bit
more formal and mathematical to show why
it is that what this is computing is the
product of a and B</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
