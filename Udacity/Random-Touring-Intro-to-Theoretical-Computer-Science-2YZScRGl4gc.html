look at the shortest tour problem now
let's say we wanted to use a randomized
algorithm to solve the shortest tour
problem and how about we run it on an N
vertex graph say we decided to run our
randomized algorithm a thousand times
and we got the following results we got
a tour length between a thousand 56 and
15 37 and along with that we got the
number of times each of those results
were found now we also have a known
factor two approximation algorithm and
we found an approximation of 12 36 with
this now what I'd like to know is given
the above information and we will copy
that information into the instructor
comments below so that you can look at
it during the quiz which of these
statements are true does the shortest
tour for the input graph have to have a
length of a thousand fifty six is the
random algorithm likely a factor three
approximation algorithm have we found a
tour that is at most one point seven one
times as long as the optimal one or
similarly have we found one that is at
most one point four three times as long
as the optimal one check whichever of
these you think are true</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
