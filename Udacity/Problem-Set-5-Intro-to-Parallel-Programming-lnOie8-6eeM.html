designing and implementing a fast
parallel algorithm to compute histograms
you already implemented a kernel for
computing histograms in prompts at
number three that used atomic operations
however it turns out that we can get
much better performance if we avoid
atomic operations all together and that
is our goal in problem set number five
there are a lot of different ways to
efficiently compute histograms when
strongly encourage you to experiment and
test out different ideas but one basic
strategy that works well is as follows
first swore the input data into your
course bins to use each thread block to
compute a local histogram for the data
that falls into a single coarse bin 3
concatenate each of the horse histograms
together this strategy is advantageous
because each local histogram will have a
small number of bins so they will be
able to fit into share memory this is
true regardless of how many bins the
final histogram has let's look at a
simple example to see how the strategy
will work suppose our input data that's
in the range of 0 to 999 and suppose we
want you bin our input data into a
hundred different equally sized
histogram bins and here's our data as
you can see it ranges from 0 to 999 and
now let's compute the bin ID for each
input element as well as a course bin ID
for each input element so let's suppose
we have ten equally sized course bins
and this is the result of calculating
the bin ID as well as the course bin ID
for each of the input element and now
that sort
the final bin ID by the course bin ID
and I see what we have and this is the
final result after one source the bin ID
by its course bin ID now let's assign a
thread block to each course bin so 3
plus 0 is responsible for
computing the histogram of course Ben ID
0 threat block 1 won't have anything to
do because in the sorted course being ID
there is not a bid with an ID of 1 so it
will compute an empty histogram to my
blog true will compute the histogram of
course being ID of 2 and so on and to
get our final histogram we can simply
concatenate all those histograms
together end to end so when would
combine the histogram that we calculated
for course being idea 1 with the
histogram that when computed for course
been an ID of 2 and so on and so forth
and that's it good luck</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
