start with a graph G from G you can
construct its laplacian L of G now
suppose you have a partition of G that
implies a partitioning of the vertices
into two sets call them V plus or V
minus in linear algebraic terms you can
translate this vertex partition into a
partition vector each vertex I is
assigned to one partition or the other
designated by a plus one or minus one
now suppose you want to know the number
of cut edges in G then you can count it
algebraically that suggests that
partitioning could be viewed as choosing
an X to minimize this quantity so this
becomes a combinatorial optimization
problem formally we want an X that
minimizes the number of cut edges
subject to two conditions first you want
to assign every vertex to one partition
or the other and you want the same
number of vertices in each partition
this problem is unfortunately
np-complete rats so to work around that
let's relax the problem a little let's
start by taking away the requirement
that we assign exactly a plus one or a
minus one to every vertex if you do so
then there's a really neat fact we can
use this fact combines everything we
know about graph laplacian along with a
cool theorem from linear algebra called
the current Fisher or minimax theorem if
we're allowed to use any vector Y where
Y is normalized in a certain way and its
elements sum to zero then the vector Y
that minimizes this quantity is actually
q1 q1 you'll remember is the eigenvector
corresponding to the second smallest
eigen value and in fact the minimum
value simplifies to something that is
proportional to that eigen value so what
does this mean let's go back to the
original optimization problem our most
recent fact tells us that the optimal
value is at least this quantity to turn
all this into an algorithm you need one
more idea choosing X to be q1 gives us a
lower bound on the thing we want but how
do we take a q1 and actually turn it
into something that is a partition
vector in other words something that has
plus or minus 1 values and all the
entries do you remember our spring
analogy in fact the laplacian derived
from the spring system gives us a second
smallest eigen vector that looks like
this
if you plot the components of the
eigenvector for the second smallest
eigenvalue you'll get something that
looks like this it's signed curvy
because that's what the fundamental
modes of the spring system look like and
as it turns out half of its elements are
positive and the other half are negative
so that suggests the following algorithm
first compute the laplacian for the
graph then compute its second smallest
eigen pair then determine the partition
using the signs of the components of the
eigenvector so that was a lot of work
but the final algorithm is very compact
and indeed for planar algorithms it
works really really well here are two
examples of what the spectral
partitioning algorithm produces on two
graphs hey someone should make a t-shirt
out of these</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
