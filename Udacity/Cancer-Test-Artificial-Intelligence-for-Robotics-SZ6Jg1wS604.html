a completely different example to see if
you understand how to apply Bayes rule
this time it's about cancer testing and
it's an example that is commonly studied
in statistics classes suppose there
exists a certain type of cancer but the
cancer is rare only 100,000 people has
the cancer whereas 999 10,000 people
don't have it it is filled by the
probability of cancer and the
probability of not cancer suppose we
have a test and the test cannot come up
positive or negative the probability
that the test trigger is positive if I
have cancer is 0.8 and it probability
that the test comes out positive given
that I'm cancer-free is only 0.1 so
clearly the test has a strong
correlation to whether I have cancer he
is a really difficult question can you
compute for me the probability of cancer
given that I just received a positive
test let me emphasize this is not an
easy question but you should be able
based on what I taught you to calculate
this result think of the cancer non
cancer is the robot position and think
of the positive as whether the colored
or observed is the correct one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
