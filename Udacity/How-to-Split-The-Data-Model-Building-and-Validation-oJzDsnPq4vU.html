the data first we have the training data
this is the data that we use to train a
model secondly we have validation data
this data is used to select a model
third we have the test data this is the
data we use to report the performance of
a model now training error is used to
tune the performance of the model on the
training set a validation error is used
to select the model that works best
among many models we then use the test
error to calculate the performance of
the model that we have already selected
in the next few videos we will introduce
each of these errors and how we use them
to make the decision to eventually use a
specific model to solve our problem and
to identify cars in the connected cars
data set there are no general rules how
best one should split the data for each
of the three purposes depending on the
size of the volume of the data set one
we decide to split in proportion of 50
for training 25 to validate and 25 to
test often one might need more for
training or validation there are also
constraints from the model itself and
the complexity at which we build the
model we will talk about model
complexity shortly it is important to
note that the test data needs to be set
aside until a particular validated model
has been selected this gives us an
unbiased estimate of the performance of
the model more specifically when we are
building the model we do not examine the
test data at all this is to avoid
biasing our results on the test set this
is an essential part of the validation
process</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
