hours and earn four hundred dollars
let's say you start a new job that pays
a different hourly wage now you're going
to work 35 hours and earn six hundred
thirty dollars at this new job let's say
you worked 35 hours and you earn six
hundred thirty dollars how much could
you were in working 50 hours whenever we
solve problems involving variation we
want to set up a proportion so let's
make this really simple if I worked one
hour I would earn ten dollars based on
my original example so if I work double
that amount of time I would get double
the amount of money I would earn twenty
dollars notice that if my hours worked
increased then my amount of money also
increased this is so that way these two
fractions will be equal and one of the
biggest things we want to make sure of
when solving variation problems is that
we have one fraction involving hours and
another involving income we always want
to keep our units the same whenever we
have direct variation the first amount
of one unit will be directly across from
the first amount of the second unit so
when I'm filling in this proportion 35
hours should go here for the amount of
hours worked for one and six hundred and
thirty dollars should go here for the
income work for one because if we work
35 hours we earn six hundred and thirty
dollars so you try solving this one how
much money could we earn if we worked 50
hours be sure you don't include the
dollar sign in your answer I already
have that written for you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
