can change appearance to reflect the
different states they're in for example
they may change appearance to show that
they are checked or pressed or focused
or even some combination of that such as
both checked and pressed if you were
making a web app you would define these
States in CSS but in Android we use
state lists state lists are XML files
that lists the assets to use given a
particular state of a UI element you
just give it a range of resources for
the different States and everything is
taken care of for you so here's a state
list for a checkboxes drawable it uses
different images for each of the defined
States when the checkbox is just checked
it uses this image when it's just
pressed and not checked it uses this one
and if it's both checked and your finger
is pressed down on the check box it
should use this image and by default in
the case where you know there are no
special States it just uses this default
version when using a stateless drawable
for a UI element Android traverses the
selector and looks for the first item
that meets the minimum criteria for the
state so if you want to use an image to
represent multiple states such as this
one pressed and checked that should be
above the more general ones now the
interesting thing about States is that
you can even create your own
while there's things like pressed and
checked and focused and selected and
activated and you know really a lot of
different types of states you can even
create your own States to you know to
map to whatever your application needs
to represent in its UI elements</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
