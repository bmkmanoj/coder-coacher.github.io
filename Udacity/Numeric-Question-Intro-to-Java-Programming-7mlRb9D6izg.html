method in the Czech answer method I'm
given a response which is a string I
converted true a number by calling
double parse table and now I check
whether that number is close enough to
the actual answer you've learned a
lesson for how to do that you take the
difference of the two numbers that you
want to compare take the absolute value
and check whether it's most forgiving
tolerance now there's just one catch
what's this answer here well it's
whatever was supplied in the said answer
method interestingly the said answer
method here takes a double so it's not a
string and that means it's different
from the said answer method that was
defined in the question class that
method took a string now I could have
converted this number into a string and
then passed it on to the set answer
method of the question class and that
the question stored as a string and then
I could have converted it back from a
string to a number I suppose except when
I tried that that didn't work because
the question class has no way of giving
me back the answer it's used inside its
own check answer method but that one is
worthless to me because it doesn't take
the tolerance into account so instead I
just store the answer as a double in the
numeric question</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
