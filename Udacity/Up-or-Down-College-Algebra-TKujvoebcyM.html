when you have a negative exponent you
can rewrite whatever turn you're dealing
with so that we're instead dividing by
that factor inside the term so negative
exponents are actually veiled ways of
writing division into our turn the way
we know what we're dividing by is to
find the factor with the negative
exponent which is just Y to the negative
2 in this case and we move it underneath
the factors with the positive exponents
to make it the denominator of the term
so on the right side of the equation
where we've moved it it's now in the
denominator and we've also changed the
power of the base to be positive instead
of negative so when we flip the sign of
an exponent from negative to positive or
from positive to negative we need to
move the factor or the base number that
the exponent is applied to to the
opposite side of the fraction if it's in
the top it needs to move to the bottom
and if it's the bottom it needs to move
to the top and we also flip the sign of
the exponent so here we change from
negative to positive so basically if we
have some number let's call it X and
it's taken to a negative power let's say
that's negative a where it could be any
number or really any expression then
this is equal to 1 over X to the power
of a so again we multiply the exponent
of a number by negative 1 we need to
switch which part of the fraction the
factor it belongs to is part of I know
that what's on the left side here
doesn't look like a fraction but this is
actually secretly X to the negative a
over 1 so anything that doesn't look
like it's part of a fraction is actually
in the numerator of a fraction or the
denominator is 1</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
