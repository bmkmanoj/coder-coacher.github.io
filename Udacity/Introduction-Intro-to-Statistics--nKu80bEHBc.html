today we do a case study and the case
study is based on data that you the
students submit it we're on facebook you
all discussed my weight and you've all
seen me in this class and in whooping
163 of you followed this very hidden
facebook discussion and submitted your
guesses so thanks to all of you I know
have a data set in my first study I will
treat your guesses it's my data or
sample and somewhat abusing the nature
of my own weight I treat my own weight
as the apothem so technically speaking
this is a bit of an abuse we're not
really testing whether my own weight is
incorrect but you can still use the same
math and have a lot of fun so towards
the end of this exercise you will
actually find out my weight please don't
tell anybody so here's the actual data
that was submitted by all of you and one
of the really interesting findings he is
that some of you had some fun so in the
data you find it guess one times ten to
the 22 which is about the weight of the
planet Pluto in kilograms and then
there's three counter guesses with the
minus one which makes me suspect that
these numbers were submitted by the same
person some of you think i weigh 0
whereas others think i weigh a thousand
kilograms as much as a car thank you so
much very kind of you so let's take this
data and ask you the first quiz</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
