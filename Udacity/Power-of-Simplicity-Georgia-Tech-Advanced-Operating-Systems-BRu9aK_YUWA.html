should be simple and power of simplicity
is the key for adoption so in this case
let's revisit the sequential program for
video analytics that I showed you
earlier converting the sequential
program for video analytics into a
distributed program using the get put
primitives provided by pts is fairly
straightforward what you do is you
interpose between these computations
that are there in the original pipeline
channels that are named entities that
can be used to hold the temporal
evolution of output from a particular
computation so in this case camera
capture is a thread and this capture
computation captures images from a
camera with a certain periodicity and
places it into a named channel called
frames and so the frames channel
abstraction is going to contain the
temporal evolution of output produced by
this capture computation and the
detector can discover where this frame
channel is connect to it and get images
from this channel process them and
produce blobs that characterize the
objects that it sees in any particular
given frame so this is a temporal
evolution of the detectors output
corresponding to the frames that it sees
and the tracker takes these blobs and
interesting blobs from that are the
objects that is tracking and it produces
a temporal evolution of the location of
objects that it sees and places it in
its output channel and a recognizer may
then look at these objects and consult a
database of known objects to see whether
any of those objects that are being
continuously captured detected and
tracked correspond to anything that may
indicate that there is an anomalous
situation and those are the events that
and those events may trigger alarm so
basically what what I'm showing you here
is converting the sequential program for
video analytics into a distributed
program using the channel abstraction
and the get put primitives available in
the pts programming model so the ovals
are the threads of the pts abstraction
and these rectangles are the channels
that are there between any two
computational entities</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
