own data and we'll see how the bar gets
raised as the stages of meaningful use
progress we've discussed the
requirements in the first two stages in
stage 3 has proposed 80% of patients
must be able to access their records
either through the VDT function or
through an ONC certified API or
application programming interface and
35% must have access to patient specific
educational materials we mentioned the
term API in our team project discussion
near the end of lesson 1 when we
discussed fire for all practical
purposes these two terms are probably
going to be synonymous in healthcare
that is fire will be the API used in
health care unsurprisingly stage 3 also
raises the bar on actual patient
engagement 25% of patients must access
their records either through VDT or
through an ONC certified API 35% of
patients must receive a clinically
relevant secure message and of great
interest with respect to patient phasing
technologies such as those we'll discuss
in lesson 7 providers must incorporate
patient generated data from non clinical
settings such as home health for 15% of
their patients
this requirement clearly anticipates the
increased use of mobile technologies and
sensors in the home Stage threes
proposed provider requirements also
increase the percentage of ypres
scription x' to 85% for eligible
providers and 25% for eligible hospitals
they also require the use of five
clinical decision support tools tied to
for quality measures and providers must
use drug-to-drug and drug-to-allergy
interaction alerts during the entire
reporting period hospitals must
Seve at least 80% of medication orders
60% of laboratory orders and 60% of
diagnostic imaging orders via computer
based physician order entry
although order entry by scribes
assistants to physicians who enter the
information for them does count toward
these goals finally stage 3 has specific
interoperability requirements providers
must send an electronic summary for 50%
of transitions of care and referrals you
recall that these are major sources of
error in patient care they must receive
an electronic summary for 40% of
transitions and referral and providers
must perform medication allergy problem
list reconciliation for 80% of
transitions of care and referrals
finally eligible providers must
electronically submit three out of five
of the following reporting requirements
immunizations syndrome ik surveillance
this would be for infectious diseases
reportable conditions case reporting
certain conditions that need to be
reported to public health public health
registries to keep track of certain
diseases and conditions and non public
health registries such as those for
cancer eligible hospitals must submit
four from the same list to which
electronic lab reporting is added</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
