pseudo Facebook data let's hear from
Dean again about another technique that
you can use in your work as a data
analyst much of the analysis we've done
so far focused on some preachers
invariable relationship or question of
interest we then used EDA to let those
chosen variables speak and surprised us
most recently when analyzing the
relationship between two variables we
look to incorporate more variables into
the analysis to improve it for example
by seeing whether a particular
relationship is consistent across values
of those other variables in choosing a
third or fourth variable to plot we
relied on our domain knowledge but often
we might want visualizations or
summaries to help us identify such
auxiliary variables in some analyses we
may plan to make use of a large number
of variables perhaps we are planning on
predicting one variable with 10 20 or
hundreds of others or maybe we want to
summarize a large set of variables into
a smaller set of dimensions or perhaps
we're looking for interesting
relationships among a large set of
variables in such cases we can help
speed up our exploratory data analysis
by producing many plots or comparisons
at once this can be one way to let the
data set as a whole speak in part by
drawing our attention to variables we
didn't have a pre-existing interest in</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
