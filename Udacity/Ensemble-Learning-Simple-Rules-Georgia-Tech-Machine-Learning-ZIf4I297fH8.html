learning is first this that you take a
bunch of simple rules all of which kind
of makes sense and you can see is sort
of helping but on their own individually
do not give you a good answer and then
you magically combine them in some way
to create a more complex rule than in
fact works really well and ensemble
learning algorithms have a sort of basic
form to them that can be described in
just one or two lines so let me do that
and then we can start wondering a little
bit how we're going to make that real so
here's the basic form of an ensemble
learning algorithm basically you learn
over a subset of the data and that
generates some kind of a rule and then
you learn over another subset of the
data and that generates a different rule
and then you learn over another subset
of the data and that generates yet a
third rule and you had a fourth rule and
you had a fifth rule and so on and so
forth and they eventually you take all
of those rules and you combine them into
one of these complex rules so we might
imagine in the email case that I might
look at a small subset of email that I
know is already spam and discovered that
the word Manly shows up in all of them
and therefore pick that up as a rule
that's going to be good at that subset
of mail but not necessarily be good at
the other subset of mail and do the same
thing and discover that a lot of the
spam mails are in fact short or a lot of
them are just images or just URLs and so
on and so forth and that's how I learn
these rules by looking at different
subsets which is why you end up with
rules that are very good at a small set
of the data but aren't necessarily good
at a large set of data and then after
you collected these rules you combine
them in some way and there you go and
that's really the beginning and the end
of ensemble learning so wait so when you
say Manly was in a lot of the positive
examples do you mean like it
distinguishes the positive and the
negative example so it should also not
be in the negative examples that's right
that's exactly right so think of this as
any other classification learning
problem that you would have where you're
trying to come up with some way to
distinguish between the positives and
the negatives and and now why does it
why are we looking at substituted data I
understand why we can't just look at the
whole data well if we look at all of the
data then it's going to be hard to come
up with these these simple rules that's
the basic answer actually asked me that
question a little bit later when we talk
about overfitting and I think I'll have
a good answer for you okay so here we go
Michael
this is ensemble learning you learn over
a subset of the data over and over
in picking up new rules and then you
combine them and you're done</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
