for this one David so I observed two
things are going on between a and B the
dot in the top right is disappearing and
the diamond is moving out and growing so
I said that the dot would still
disappear even though it's on the other
side of the frame and the circle that
was inside the triangle will move out
and grow so I said the answer was to
here I've drawn a connection between the
circle and the triangle the diamond in
the circle and the dot it's analogous
dot to seems to be the right answer
David notice that the circle and two is
on the left of the triangle even though
the diamond on the and B was on the
right of the circle that is ok because
the diamond is replacing the dot here
and similarly the circle is replacing
the dot here so the dot was on the left
of the triangle here it makes sense to
particular circle on left North triangle
notice the drawing a connection between
the diamond here and the circle here was
very easy for us to do but designing an
agent they can make that kind of
connection is much more difficult so
we'll deal with lots of methods to help
agents make what are very natural
conclusions for us yes of course raises
another issue how do we do it how do you
solve the problem why was it so easy for
you why is it so hard for AI yet under
the cushion when David was trying to
solve this problem he looked at the
relationship between a and B and then
mapped it to see and some image here but
one could have gone about it the other
way one could have picked any one of
these images put it in a D and asked
whether it will be a good fit so in one
case one can start from the problem and
propose a solution in another case one
can take one of these solutions at a
time put it here and see whether it
matches two different strategies</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
