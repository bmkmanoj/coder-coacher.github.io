have a thing that I'm going to call the
fundamental theorem of PSRs but we could
just call it the PSR theorem that says
specifically any end State Palme D P can
be represented by a predictive state
representation or POS or with no more
than n tests each of which is no longer
than n steps long oh so that's good but
also you just introduce something the
number of steps i guess i didn't think
about that before since both of those
tests were sort of it was very short
right yeah but you know and it's not
hard to come up with an example like
that right I'm writing it as a pom DP
because i am a you know limited beast
it's hard for me to think about PSRs so
what might a test be that you'd need to
represent you know palm beefy written
like this so we've got you know white
statewide state black state black state
so so one step test would be things like
if I go well there's only that one
action and I see white what's the
probability of that that's not enough
information to know where we are right
right in fact seeing black is also not
enough in this case we actually have to
think about what happens in two steps
from now right so yeah yes you could say
liver test is two steps away then I
could for example figure out if I see a
white and then I see a black then I know
I must have been in the bottom state
right if I see black after making one
move then I had to be in one of the two
middle states right and I guess if I
took two steps and I saw white twice
then I know I had to be in the top state
for example so are you saying that you
think we need another another test to
make this go well I don't know I'm just
just occurs to me that I can figure out
that I'm in the top state if I see two
white ones that's all I'm just pointing
that out well wouldn't it be enough to
just know okay if I go up will I see
white and then go up and see black if
the probability of that is 0 and going
up and seeing black the probability of
that is 0 0 so the if going up I see
black the probability is 0 then I have
to be in either the top state or the
bottom state and if it's also the case
if I will not be able to see white and
then black then that tells me what state
I must be in yeah that was the thought
right yeah yeah sure sure but these
longer tests are really important here
just having the single step doesn't give
you enough information doesn't give you
enough constraint with those two tests
can die alone figure out everything I
completed some because i think it's like
the
example that we looked at which is we if
we know that we're in one of these
states top 2nd 3rd 4th then I think
these two tests are enough to tell us
which of those four things were in but
in general a belief state might be
something like well point six of the top
1 and point 2 of the second one and
point 1 and point something else so in
that case we've got a four dimensional
vector actually a three dimensional
vector because it has that up to one
that we're trying to specify inter by
way of two numbers and we get that same
kind of indeterminacy that you worked us
through in the in the other example
actually okay so this kind of makes me
want to ask a question okay why does
this help why should I bother going to
PS are other than the mathematical
niceties there are some examples where
it helps and part of it is a
philosophical thing that's it's got to
be better for us in the long run to
represent our world in terms of things
that we can actually observe instead of
things that we can never ever observe so
that's kind of the philosophical point
that this answers there is as far as I'm
aware the literature that I'm familiar
with in terms of learning a pom DP you
can learn a PSR representation may be
easier than learning a pom DP
representation but the thing that I find
interesting is that there's there's palm
DPS that are easy to learn and there's
palm dp's that are hard to learn and the
palm dp's that are easy to learn are
easy to learn as PSRs and the palm dp's
that are hard to learn are hard to learn
as PSRs so there's almost sort of this
underlying toughness of the palm DP
itself or the the environment itself
that switching to PSRs doesn't seem to
exactly help the there is a case though
when certain certain of the attributes
of the problem are continuous where in
fact it can be shown that a PSR
representation can actually be learned
efficiently when the palm DP
representation is not clearly there in a
bowl efficiently I mean I suppose one
nice thing about the test model like at
least in a particular case where you
know there's like some one or zero
probability of a test coming out under
certain circumstances it might be easier
to think about what you ought to do in
order to figure out exactly where you
are mmm like the set of tests you might
run so that you can completely determine
where it is you are in the real sort of
underlying just knowing that might be a
useful thing yeah yeah for
control and yeah discovery right yeah I
mean I not familiar with papers that do
that exactly yes you are do you have a
paper that does that exactly homes and
those go I wouldn't think of it that way
I always thought of it that way or at
least satinder told me that I should
think about it though yeah I didn't
think about it that wait till he told me
I should and that in particular that
satinder singh who his group did a lot
of the pioneering work on PSRs and
headed some very nice analyses for how
they work so yeah okay but I just wanted
to give kind of a sense of this there is
some more recent work using least
squares methods instead of probabilistic
methods that actually can lean on this
PSR idea to learn efficiently actually
if you have enough data it can actually
turn it into a model that predicts well
and the model has elements in common
with PSRs so it has gotten some leverage
I think the jury's still out as to
whether or not this is really the way we
want to represent our environments but
it's a useful tool for the toolbox yeah
I can see that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
