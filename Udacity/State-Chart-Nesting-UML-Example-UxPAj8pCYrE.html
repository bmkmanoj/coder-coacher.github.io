machine that's either heating or cooling
it's some kind of air conditioning
system and on the lower right is a
nested state called heating heating is
just a two state sub system one of the
states is activating and the others is
called act active okay it's got a
default state which is the activating
state and it's got a transition which
occurs when the activating is ready and
it the action that takes place is to to
turn things on this nested state is part
of the larger system which at the top
level has three important States as an
idle state a cooling state and this
nested heating state the default state
for the larger machine is idle and the
final state is a shutdown state and
there are transitions between the
various outer states but notice also the
transitions that from the nested heating
state go only to the boundary of that
state and not into the internals of that
state thereby saving duplicate copies of
the lines coming from each of the
internal states in the heating state</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
