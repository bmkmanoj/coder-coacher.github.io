TD lambda a really useful way of
studying it is by studying not TD lambda
so in particular we're gonna look at K
step estimators for a moment and then
we're gonna relate that back to TD
lambda so so here's what a case step
estimator is so let's say we're trying
to estimate the value of a state s T so
it's a state that we just are leaving as
a function of what happens next so let's
let's look at this first estimator here
it says that that we're gonna estimate
the value of a state that we're leaving
by moving it a little bit in the
direction of the immediate reward plus
the discounted estimated value of the
state that we landed in and we're gonna
just move a little bit in that direction
so do you recognize this have you seen
this before I believe I have seen this
before
what did we call it I don't remember
anymore oh well that's unfortunate
so as I've seen it before it's just like
a one step look ahead sort of thing yeah
exactly which is which is what we were
calling TD zero
oh right yes yes that make sense and in
fact you're exactly right that the the
way to think about that is is a one step
estimator right so it's a one step
estimator and that we use the immediate
reward that we got plus the value of the
state that we land in but let's contrast
that with a two step estimator we'll
call it e two estimator to where what we
do is to estimate the value of a state
that we're leaving we're gonna move a
little bit in the direction of the
immediate reward that we received plus
the discount did reward that we received
next plus the double discounted value of
the state that we landed in two steps
from now so now instead of where we were
before we did an estimate by taking one
reward and we estimate the rest of the
sequence using our current estimates
here we're taking two rewards and using
that as our immediate estimate plus our
estimate of the future taken as the
state that we reach Tuesday two steps
from now so does that make sense kind of
as an extension of that idea no that
makes sense so if he one is a one step
look ahead then e 2 is a two step look
at yeah yeah yeah exactly so we use two
steps two real steps followed by this
kind of look-ahead thing and we can do
that for three right here and we could
do that for K where we're the value of
state by K rewards summed up here Plus
and then we estimate the value of the
future by looking at the state we end up
in K steps from now
and discounting that by K steps and in
fact if we can keep if we continue doing
this arbitrarily
we eventually get to infinity where
let's see what would happen in that case
so we get the sum of rewards that it
keeps going and keeps going and
eventually at infinity we look at the
state that we end up at infinity which
of course isn't a real thing but then
it's okay because we discounted by gamma
to the Infinity which is zero so this
piece of the term actually drops out and
we just end up with this infinite sum of
rewards now this last estimator should
look familiar to you to Charles
yeah that looks like TD one good so now
we've got TD zero on the one side as a
one step estimator and TD one on the
other side as an infinity step estimator
and we've got these other things in
between that we don't really have or
possibly even need a name for well that
makes a lot more sense than with the
title case step estimator so I was
worried this was going to turn in some
kind of commentary about dubstep
oh yes break it down so that's not gonna
happen in this case that's probably for
the best so what I need to do next is
actually relate these quantities to TD
lambda which we're gonna show is a
weighted combination of all these
estimators o infinity of them.all
infinity of them no that's that's pretty
impressive</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
