Salem and I'm here with CEO and founder
of katana health Cory kid
Cory how are you I'm doing well thanks
great so Cory can you tell me a little
bit about katana health sure seok Italia
help is a health care company that's
about two and a half years old we focus
on chronic care management for patients
now we happen to do that using an
interactive robot and artificial
intelligence so we have a solution that
is focused on solving real challenges
that patients have but doing that not
for a small group of patients looking
that can scale to a large number of
patients can you tell me a little bit
about your background please and how you
guys started in healthcare so I've been
working in healthcare technology for
about 20 years now I started off 20
years ago that Georgia Tech doing an
undergrad degree in computer science
focused in really on healthcare
applications of that ended up actually
by the time I finished my undergrad
degree being hired as research faculty
helped build a research lab focused on
what we now call aging in place to a lot
of different technology in the home
environment for people to be able to
live at home longer rather than move
into a nursing home or assisted living
facility in 2001 when I went back to
grad school ended up going to MIT to the
Media Lab wanted to say that broad space
healthcare technology but start you know
playing with a new fun cutting-edge
technology at that point the the idea of
social robots are interact interactive
robots was very new they've been a few
of them built at that point in time I
thought they might have some promise in
this space so ended up spending a couple
of years doing some of the studies
around the site basic psychology of
interaction and what that led into is
now what I've been doing for the last 15
16 years in seeing that ok this works
really well when we care about long-term
engagement with people there's this huge
set of problems in healthcare that we
need to solve around engagement let's
put these two things together and so my
work is iteratively then applied that
into new areas of healthcare as we've
continued to evolve and adapt the
technology to support that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
