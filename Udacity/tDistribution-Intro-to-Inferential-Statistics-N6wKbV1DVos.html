now we've assumed that we know the
population parameters mu and Sigma but
much of the time we don't we often only
have samples which we must then use to
draw all our conclusions in the next two
lessons we'll use samples to find out
how different a sample mean is from a
population and how different two samples
are from each other out of all the
measures of center we usually use the
mean now the two samples were comparing
in this case can either be dependent or
independent we'll go over these
differences later in lesson 10 we're
going to look at these and then in
lesson 11 we'll look at independent
samples it's going to be fun when we
work with samples we have to estimate
the population standard deviation using
the sample standard deviation with
Bessel's correction remember this from
lesson 4 normally to find out how
typical or atypical a sample mean is and
what you did before is we would find its
location on the distribution of sample
means the sampling distribution and we
can determine the shape and parameters
of this sampling distribution if we know
the population parameters remember that
for any sample mean we can find where it
falls on this distribution by
standardizing in other words finding the
z-score of the sample mean we find the
difference between the sample mean and
mu and then divide by the standard error
but now the standard error depends on
the sample we can no longer use Sigma if
we have a sample therefore we end up
with a new distribution that is more
prone to error this is called the T
distribution since it's more prone to
error then it's more spread out and
thicker in the tails than a normal
distribution remember from lesson seven
when you learned that larger sample
sizes result in skinnier sampling
distributions that same principle
applies here so what do you think
happens as n the sample size increases
the standard error increases the T
distribution approaches a normal
distribution the T distribution gets
skinnier tails and finally asks the
sample standard deviation approaches
Sigma</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
