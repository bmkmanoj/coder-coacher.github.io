message passing verses shared memory
quiz if we have 1 cor initializing an
array and then all others reading the
entire array data distribution the
number of lines of code you need to do
it in message passing is significant the
number of lines of code we need for that
in shared memory is really zero lines of
code because once the array is
initialized in memory others can simply
read it they don't need to really
distribute the data in any way in
contrast in message passing the court
that initializes the array now needs to
send it explicitly to all the other
cores and the other cores need to
receive it explicitly so there is
definitely more lines of code in message
passing than in shared memory
once you have the data distribution for
shared memory you don't need to do
anything for it for message passing you
need to send and receive synchronization
that make sure that the array is
initialized before we get to read it
that's how many lines of code in message
passing it adds zero lines of code
because the sends and receives that we
needed to do to distribute the data
already ensure that until we receive the
array we cannot read it so when we get
to read it after the receive we know
that it's been already initialized
because the send happens after the
initialization in shared memory however
while the initialization is happening
the other threads could just begin
reading it so we need to add some
explicit synchronization now to make
sure that the readers wait while the
initialization is happening so we here
have more than 0 lines of code in this
case the message passing code is simpler
as far as synchronization is concerned
than the shared memory code this is
typically gonna be what happens between
shared memory and message passing
message passing needs to distribute data
but in doing so it also synchronizes
shared memory doesn't need to distribute
data but if synchronization is needed
after the distribution it needs to add
explicit code to do that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
