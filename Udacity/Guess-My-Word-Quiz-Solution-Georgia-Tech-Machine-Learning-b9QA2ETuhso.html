first of all I think the first thing if
I'm right is so is the following
statement true once we know forward then
we right we will stumble on to the right
answer when we do the neighborhood well
so okay so that's a good idea so we
could actually do one more step mm-hmm
and see what happened so yeah because in
this particular case the because of the
fitness function is the way that it is
the number of correct bits there's
always a neighbor that is one step
closer to the target so we're always
going to be incrementing as we go so
this is a very friendly fitness function
it's only only a global optimum right so
do you want to do that and then maybe we
could talk about how we could have been
even more clever so let's just pick the
first one okay and so now we had to do
the fourth one zero one one zero and
then the fifth one is one zero one zero
one good alright so if this is X and
these are the neighbors of X these are
the scores and it turns out that one of
them actually has all five matches so
that was in fact the pattern I was
thinking of here just to prove it one
zero one one zero and if we now continue
the search from here all the neighbors
are going to be worse
obviously right so how could we have
figured out the sequence without that
extra information that I just gave you
well if we look at the two that have
four we can basically just see that
where the they must have three in common
which they do one the first the second
and the last one okay and each is off by
exactly one so that means that well
since I know the answer I know that you
just take what you just take one from
each so either they both have to be ones
or they both have to be zeros all right
and so do we know that the zero one
doesn't work we probably know that the
zero one doesn't work because then the
answer would be 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
which is exactly we already know is a 3
right so then it has to be 1 0 1 1 0
which attracted it which it was cool
right so this was in fact a very nice
fitness function and and you know it
seems to me that we had a nice little
advantage here and that we really
understood this for
traverse space but if this were 5,000
bit sequence where the fitness function
was some weird thing where in fact we
didn't even know what it was we just
knew that there was one then that would
have been a whole lot harder actually
here's a question for you Michael if I
told you if I had given you this but I
haven't didn't tell you what the fitness
function was just that when you gave me
a sequence I evaluated it for you huh we
wouldn't have been able to do any of
this stuff that we were doing I mean
we'd still be able to do it but we
wouldn't been able to jump ahead like we
just like we could have done with those
two there before because we wouldn't
even know what the maximum fitness value
was yeah we would have had to done this
last step to find that one of them has a
score of five and then we would had to
done that step again to make sure that
there wasn't anything locally better
than five because we wouldn't have known
that if we didn't have a kind of
semantic understanding of the fitness
function but but the rest of the
algorithm was perfectly implementable
without knowing that right all that you
were basing your decisions on was you
gave me bit sequences I gave you scores
and you use those to figure out what
next bit sequence to ask it it didn't
use the fact that the fitness function
had a particular form that's right all
right now in this one this particular
problem is very very well behaved
because it has one global optimum this
bit sequence it has a score of five
nothing else had a five and once you're
at fun and and no other bit sequence
actually could you be stuck right so it
was always the case that you could
always get closer to the target pattern
so your score can always go up but in
general that's not how things work that
you may actually be able to get stuck in
local optima and we need a way of
dealing with that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
