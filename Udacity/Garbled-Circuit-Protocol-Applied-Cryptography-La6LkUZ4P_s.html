we have two participants we'll call
Alice the generator that means she's
gonna make the circuit and Bob the
evaluator that means he's gonna evaluate
the circuit at the beginning of the
protocol they've agreed on some circuit
they want to evaluate for this to be
interesting would be much larger than
that and it takes inputs from both Bob
and from Alice Alice is going to
generate a garbled table for each one of
these logic gates in the circuit and
send the garbled circuit to Bob she's
also going to send her input values but
because they're random nan says Bob
can't tell what they mean Bob's going to
evaluate the circuit using the garbled
circuit protocol decrypting one entry
from each of these and at the end of
this Bob's gonna get some output values
and then they're going to do something
to turn that into the semantic value
which possibly Bob receives possibly
Alice receives we can design the
protocol either way and I'm not going to
talk about that final step of how you
turn the encrypted values at the end of
the circuit into meaningful values we'll
leave that as a question for your exam
but there is one more question that I do
need to talk about that's the question
of how does Bob obtain his inputs to the
circuit to evaluate these tables Bob
needs to know both Alice's inputs and
his inputs so here the choices well Bob
could generate them himself he could ask
Alice to provide his inputs he could ask
Alice for both possible values for all
of these wire labels and then select the
right one corresponding to his inputs or
none of these possibilities actually
work</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
