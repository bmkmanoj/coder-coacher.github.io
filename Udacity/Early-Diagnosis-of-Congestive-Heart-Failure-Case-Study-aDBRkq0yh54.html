heart is no longer an effective pump
it's the single most expensive icd-9
code so there's great interest in
improving our care of it early on the
symptoms are subtle so it may not be
diagnosed for some time even after they
begin since earlier treatment can
forestall expensive complications
earlier diagnosis is preferable to help
with this researchers first analyzed
electronic patient records including the
parts that were free texts such as the
patient reported symptoms they developed
feature extraction algorithms as
illustrated here that use the structured
and text components to develop a set of
from ten to a hundred thousand clinical
features these were classified using
both logistic regression a statistical
technique commonly used to predict
whether a patient has a condition based
on characteristics of the patient and
random forest which is a method that
uses multiple methods to classify
objects this determine which features
are in fact predictive as shown here the
resulting model substantially
outperforms the diagnosis of CHF based
solely on the medical literature when as
few as 50 features with high predictive
power based on the model are added</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
