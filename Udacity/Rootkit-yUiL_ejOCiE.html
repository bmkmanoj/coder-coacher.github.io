memory resident Maris called rocket a
rocket is embedded in an operating
system
it typically modifies some of the code
and even data structures of the
operating system in order to perform
some malicious activities for example a
rootkit can be used to high a malware
from the user for example when the user
uses the Ares command to list the
contents of directory the wicked can
change the output of the errors command
so that the user will not see the
malware file similarly when the user
uses the PS command to see what programs
are running on a system the wicked can
modify the output of the PS command to
hide the running of the malware let's
study an example of how rootkit can
modify the opening system in order to
perform malicious activities for example
the Luke it is trying to hide the
malware file from the user when he lists
the contents of a directory first let's
examine what happens when a user looks
at the files in a directory suppose on
Windows the user used the command dir
there for looking at files in a
directory as we show here this command
can be implemented by a loop that keeps
looking at the next file in the
directory now let's look at how a
rootkit
can hide a malware from the user when he
looks at the files in a directory we
know that thousand directories they
reside on hard drive which is controlled
by the operating system meaning that any
access to the hard drive has to go
through the operating system therefore
in order to get informations about files
in a directory we have to go through
operating system functions in order to
get such information in other words
opening system functions are being
called to look at informations about
files and directories on hard drive and
return the results back to the user so
here is what an open system will
typically return when the user looks at
the files in a directory that is suppose
the wicked is not embedded in the OS yet
then the OS will return all the files in
a directory including the malware file
say malko Exe and this is the file that
the wicked will try to hide from the
user in order to hide
the malware from the user what the
liquor can do is to intercept any
function call to the operating system
and then reason whether the call will
end up revealing the malware and if no
it will just pass the call to the
appropriate operating system function
and if yes it's going to execute the
call but intercept the result so that
you can filter out the result as
necessary in order to hide a malware
that is the rootkit intercepts the
function call to the open system and
knows that the operating system function
call is looking at files in a directory
and then he knows that the Lewton
results may contain the malkos Exe so
the Rickett will filter out the file
name so that the user will not see this
file name in the result so here you go
when the wicked is embedded in the
operating system you can filter out the
malware file so when a user looks at the
files in a directory he will not be able
to see the malware and this is how a
rootkit in the OS k hi a malware from
the user again
the rootkit is able to accomplish this
by modifying the operating system in
particular the intercepts function call
to the operating system and filters the
results of the function calls</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
