really hard software testing problems
let me go over some of the
characteristics of these problems lack
of a specification is common or perhaps
only lack of a good specification if
there are no comparable implementations
of the kind of system or implementing
that is to say it's the first system of
its sort that makes testing quite hard
because what it probably means is we're
debugging the specification or even
developing the specification as we go
big systems are hard to test large
highly structured input spaces like
testing quite hard and so if you want to
imagine sort of a hard testing problem
with a large highly structured input
space consider for example the flight
control computers on a spacecraft or on
an airplane these things take sort of an
enormous variety of input from all sorts
of different redundant sensors the time
at which these inputs arrive is
significant the spacecraft or the
airplane has all sorts of physical
properties like its altitude its
attitude the position is where various
control surfaces that all affect the
dynamics these kind of systems are
really really sort of truly hard to test
non-determinism can make a system very
hard to test and the issue here is that
we'll play a test case against the
system once and it succeeds but then
it's on later time some variable that's
not under our control will cause the
system to fail on that same input lots
of hidden state makes systems start to
test some systems that I've heard of
that are extremely hard to test are for
example java virtual machines that are
run by for example financial
organizations on lots of cores with huge
amounts of memory these things times has
so much internal state that when
something goes wrong it's almost
impossible to make any inferences about
what was going on inside of it and you
end up needing to try to reproduce the
problem but of course this is also
extremely hard because the problem
probably happened three hours into some
sort of a massive processing task
finally if we lack strong Oracle's
testing can be really hard and so for
example something like a large molecular
simulation might be very hard to test so
we have some sort of a new simulation
code we have no idea what the right
answer is supposed to be probably it's
running on some sort of a large parallel
machine so we have a very hard time
reproducing problems problems I take a
long time to occur something like an
auto pilot would be extremely hard to
test because the response of the thing
is going to be inherently in terms of
the stability and good behavior of the
airplane and of course this is an
incredibly large complex physical object
it's very hard to model and simulate in
a reliable fashion if you think about
making a strong test or go for an auto
pilot it's all this is almost
inconceivable ok so like I said some
sort of a giant Jaypee I'm running with
lots of cores for a long time using a
huge amount of heap very very hard to
test the behavior of something in that
kind of a state so the question we want
to ask ourselves is how do we get a
handle on these situations
should we test these things and often
there aren't really any easy answers
what we can do is we can leverage weak
Oracle's to the maximum extent possible
if any of these things the simulation
the autopilot of the JVM actually
crashes in a bad fashion then we
definitely know something's gone wrong
we can try to bootstrap some degree of
confidence in the software into test by
taking small test inputs for which we've
hand checked the output and trying to
argue that for example somehow the
autopilot if it responds well for these
inputs also responds well for other test
inputs in the end if we're forwarded in
our attempts to do really good testing
we probably have to rely on non testing
methods and so of course we should be
doing code inspections and using formal
methods on our systems in any case if we
care about their reliability but what's
happening here if we really can't test
the system effectively we might have to
rely on these things more than we would
have liked okay so that's just a quick
survey of things that can make testing
really hard in practice</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
