to modify our search engine code to
implement the PageRank algorithm we have
one little problem PageRank is a
registered trademark of Google so we're
not going to call our algorithm PageRank
even though it will do the same thing
we'll call it you rank the first thing
we need to be able to do to implement
this ranking algorithm is keep track of
the link graph so our popularity of
pages depends on the link structure so
that means we need to keep track of what
pages linked to what pages so for each
link there's a connection between pages
and we can think of that as a graph
abstractly a graph is just a set of
nodes will draw those as circles with
edges between the nodes and because our
edges go one way just like links in a
page we call this a directed graph so in
order to represent our web link
structure we need to build a directed
graph the pages in the graph of the
nodes for each page we need to keep
track of the edges that connect that
node to other nodes and so the way we're
going to do this is to keep a dictionary
so we're going to have a dictionary
where the entries in the dictionary are
the node which is the URL that's the
page and for each URL will have a list
of all the pages that it links to so if
this was say no day and these were nodes
b c and d our entry for no day would
contain the list BCD and our entry for
node b well there no edges out of B so
it would be an empty list and finishing
the example C has an out link to one
node and D has no outlets so that's our
goal we want to build a structure like
this that shows the structure of the web
pages that we crawl and we see that
structure because we're following the
links in our crawler so our goal is to
modify the crawl web procedure that we
defined at the end of unit five and to
modify it so instead of just producing
an index
it also produces a graph so we're going
to modify crawl web it's going to still
take a seed page as it's starting but
what it's going to produce now is both
in index and a graph and the graph is a
structure that gives a mapping from each
node to the pages that it links to so
let's look at the code that we had at
the end of unit five and see how we need
to change that so here's the code that
we had at the end of unit five for
crawling the web and as a reminder we're
keeping track of the pages left to crawl
in the list to crawl starting with the
seed page and we're building up the
index is a dictionary and as long as
they're more pages Lester to crawl we go
through the while loop which finds a
page to crawl popping the list of pages
across as long as it's one we haven't
crawled before it gets the content from
that page it adds it to the index it
finds all the links using get all links
passing in the content on the page and
unions those with to crawl to update the
to crawl list and then it depends this
page to the list of pages that have
already been crawled so to change this
to build a graph we're going to keep
most of the code the same in addition to
producing just the index we're going to
produce a graph and the graph is also
going to be a dictionary and the reason
the graph is the dictionary is it the
mapping from nodes which are URLs to the
list of edges that go out from that node
so we'll create the graph as an empty
dictionary and as we find new pages
we're going to add them to the graph and
we're going to also change the return to
return both the index and the graph I'm
going to make one more change before we
give you a quiz and the change I'm going
to make is instead of calling get all
links here since both the graph building
and the two kroll lists depend on
knowing all the links we're going to
create a new variable and we'll assign
the result of get all links content to
that variable that means we can use
those links as the input to content but
we can also use them to build the graph
and I'm going to leave the line that we
need to build a graph for you to
complete so we'll make that a quiz to
finish this code right the line that we
need to update the graph</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
