time instead of showing that an object
is an instance of a cup we are going to
try to show that an object is an
instance of a mug so here is a
definition of a mug a mug is an object
it is stable enables drinking and
protects against heat notice that we
have added one more element here not
only stable like a cup not early enables
drinking like a cup but also protects
against heat here is an object I will
label in the kitchen the object is light
and is made of clay
it has concavity and has a handle the
bottom is flat and the sides are thick
you can assume that the agent knows
about all four examples as earlier the
glass the bowl the brick and the
briefcase in addition in this particular
case the agent also knows about yet
another example a pot the pot carries
liquid because it is concave at limits
heat transfer because it has six sides
and is made of clay your task is to
build an explanation that shows that
this object is an instance of a mug can
we prove this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
