factors on reasons why people are going
to upgrade to pay you for the service
and so for us we had multiple tiers or
pressure points that we had set up in
the plan so it's going to be like oh for
the earlier plants it's like how many
forms are going to need if you wanted
user management so for example if you
were wanting to have multiple people on
your team have access to the resources
at hand you could easily charge by that
how many entries are data that you're
going to process it's made sort of sense
and then certain features that you
wanted so for example payment
integration was one that would only be
available to higher plants and the idea
was the reason yet you stratify on all
these different areas is because
different users will pay different
things and in a product that was
generalized as Wu foo but there's lots
of industries markets and verticals
different people had different pressure
points our goal around the features was
making sure people got to try before
they buy so seeing the entries being
able to build the forms I was fine but
like payment integration it was only
available on like a middle tier plan but
we want to even free use to be able to
try it out so we would figure out ways
who said like okay 45 transactions you
can try it out for yourself to see what
it's going to be like having your own
custom theme or logo people like carried
very much about like I want this to be
part of my identity it was a big
difference for blue foo but like what we
try to do is like in all the different
ways that people might be pressured to
upgrade we tried to built that inside a
fufu it made it really obvious and then
it made sense that most people would
send around like the first plan that had
one set of unlimited features which
would be omitted forms on the middle
plan the reason you also have multiple
pricing plans is because you don't know
what the average revenue per user is
going to be so if you could predict
ahead of time that like oh the average
revenue per user is going to be like
let's say $25 then you could just have
one pricing fan it's like oh it's free
and there's going to be this because
that's about what it's going to be and I
make things a lot simpler right but you
don't know what that's ultimately gonna
be so you have this grid that's why
people set it up to capture that cost
but some people again if you're going
consumer versus going b2b people have
different price sensitivities and so for
us we thought it was like oh this would
be both consumer a b2b and that was the
case
for us but it heavily skewed that like
most of our paying customers are all b2b
we had lots of people individually using
the free plans but what would end up
happening is those people on their free
plans where our biggest word of mouth
growth sort of people so we made sure
that we fou for the users on the free
plan we made it easy for them to talk
about our services share with other
people and do all this because that's
who it's going to be our champions on
the individual side and then on the BTB
side it's usually like they're spending
someone else's money someone else's
budget so the less price-sensitive all
they care about is like does this help
me get things done so a lot of the
emphasis there is like look with one
click this is just going to work with
one click you can install this template
with like two seconds you're going to
have this feature ready for you don't
have to worry about this anymore so it's
all about that convenience and saving of
time and just like look it's going to
cost you nothing and especially for
people on the payment wanting payment
integration is like this going to pay
for itself really really quickly and
then showing that evidence of that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
