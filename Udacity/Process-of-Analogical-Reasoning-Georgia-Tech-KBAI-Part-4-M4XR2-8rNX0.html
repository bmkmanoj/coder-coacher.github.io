at new problems in terms of family or
problems it also allows us to transfer
knowledge from family of problems to new
problems a high level process of
analogical reasoning is shown here it
consists of five major phases retrieval
mapping transfer evaluation and storage
we'll discuss all five stages in detail
let us compare for a moment the process
for analogical reasoning in general with
a process for case based reasoning
within domain analogical reasoning that
we discussed earlier notice a retrieval
evaluation and storage are common
between the two processes in k-space we
used in the target problem and the
source case were from the same domain
they had the same kind of relationships
and the same kind of objects we simply
had to adopt the source case to address
the target properly and analogical
reasoning in general the target problem
and the source case need not be from the
same domain when they are not from the
same domain we can't just take this
Oscars and adapt it we first have to map
the target problem and the source case
status we need to address the
correspondence problem what in the
target problem corresponds to what in
the source case as an example the laser
beam and the target dunk irradiation
problem corresponds to the rebel army in
the source case once we have map the
concept the relationships in the target
problem to the console relationships in
the source case then we can try to
transfer some of the relationships in
the source case to the target problem we
can first abstract those relationships
and then transfer them to the target
problem as an example the dunker
radiation problem we first did the
alignment that is we address the
correspondence problem what in the
target file corresponds to what in the
source case then we took the
relationship and abstracted it the
relationship in that case was take the
resource and decompose it into several
smaller resources and send them to the
goal in the same location that
particular relationship that particular
pattern is what we obstructed and
transferred to the target problem note
that this is just one theory of
analogical reasoning and other theories
some of these boxes are configured
differently for example in another
mapping is a part of retrieval you do
mapping in order to do retrieval</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
