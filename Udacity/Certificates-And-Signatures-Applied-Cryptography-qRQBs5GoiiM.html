we can see that the certificate was
signed using a signature algorithm this
is pkcs number one using RSA encryption
so that's the padding scheme we talked
about in unit four and sha-1 is the hash
function and then we can see the value
of the certificate and this is it so we
have a thousand twenty four bits and
this is what we need to use to convince
ourselves that this is a valid
certificate of course this is actually
work that the browser is doing so we're
really trusting the browser to implement
this checking correctly so what is in
the signature it's the result of
encrypting the hash of the certificate
contents using the private key of the
issuer and the signature algorithm tells
us what we're using for the encryption
and the hashing functions and both of
these are popular but perhaps somewhat
questionable choices sha-1 is known to
have some weaknesses that may make it
possible for attackers to find hash
collisions so for this quiz I want you
to decide whether or not the certificate
contents that's used as the input to the
hash here should include the signature
itself</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
