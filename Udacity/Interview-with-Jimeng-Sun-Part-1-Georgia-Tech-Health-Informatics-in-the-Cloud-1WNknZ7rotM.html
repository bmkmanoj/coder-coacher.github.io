from right here at Georgia Tech gyming
joined us earlier this year after many
years at IBM where his work has depended
heavily on analyzing data from
electronic health records gyming thanks
very much for taking the time to be in
the course I've heard you talk many
times about the difficulties of working
with EHR data could you explain some of
those to the students sure first mark
great to be here so the electronic
health record is very important for my
research and many other people who work
on clinical informatics healthcare
informatics also need to access
electronic health record but electronic
health record is very messy a lot of
missing data in there because they are
collected for a billing and clinical
operation purpose they are not designed
for research so there are a lot of
information in EHR systems but for a
given patient they only have a small
subset of those and they're not uniform
so some patient have a lot more
information than the others and that
makes the electronic health record very
messy very difficult to deal with the
other thing is there are just a lot of
different kind of informations that are
in EHR systems and it's getting more and
more for example there are diagnosis
information such as ICD code in there
and their medication information there's
lab tests and their clinical notes
represented as free text and there are
medical images and and more and more
genomic data at getting into a EHR
system so all of those different type of
information requires different kind of
techniques to process them to analyze
them for example for text data make
clinical notes you need natural language
processing and for image you need
specialized medical image analysis tools
for structured data like diagnosis medic
stations you would use general machine
learning data mining techniques so
people have to be able to pick the right
tools to deal with the right data well
in a moment we're going to talk about
some work you've done around the early
diagnosis of congestive heart failure
which is interesting particularly within
the context to this course because
chronic disease has really been the
exemplar I've used throughout but first
in that work you've had to use that free
text data and and in fact you've
extracted from it clinical features that
can be used by machine learning
algorithms so how do you do that how
does that work right so first for people
who are not so familiar with clinical
knows it's very rich information a lot
of Sidoti and a lot of symptoms are
represented in the notes only the notes
not in the structured data so it's very
important to process the clinical notes
to extract those symptom information the
severity information that are hidden in
the text so that's the reason why we
need to process clinical notes and the
way we did that is to use a software
pipeline for dealing with text called
you email so it's unstructured
information management architecture
that's originally developed at IBM
Research later on become open source
project that many people are using that
including the later on the Watson
project so it's facilitate natural
language processing development and you
develop a pipeline of extractors to go
through the text extracting the
information that you cares about like
symptoms that related to heart failures
so we used framingham heart failure
signs and symptoms and also the context
right so you not only want to know the
symptoms are present in the text but
also whether it's in the positive
context meaning that the patient is
confirmed to have the symptoms or is in
the negative context
this the patient doesn't have the
symptoms so you also need to know the
context so we did many different
extractors and to extract that
information and also the context so it's
a lot of work so armed with that
information and the structured
information you've developed a machine
learning algorithm to diagnose
congestive heart failure earlier I
should mention to the students without a
clinical background that congestive
heart failure is the single most
expensive medical condition and that
diagnosing and treating and early as is
as we've discussed in the course is true
of most chronic diseases we can hope to
avoid the complications that are very
expensive to treat but it's very subtle
at first there there is no test like a
blood group glucose you can take two or
a human a1c to say you've got congestive
heart failure so clinicians often don't
pick up on it as early as it might be
the case your model does can you tell us
how you did that right so that's a
project we started when I ever said IBM
Research a few years ago in
collaboration with geisinger health
systems so we visit geisinger and I mean
trying to learn about what are the most
important or challenging problems that
we can't echo together using data mining
machine learning techniques and they
identified heart failure so on and at
the times there are already many groups
are interested in heart failures mostly
in the post diagnosis faces in terms of
readmission hospitalization readmission
after heart failures diagnosis and but
that groups in geisinger they focus they
wanted to look at pre diagnosis look at
what are the sciences symptom that lead
to diagnosis of heart failure can we
identify the patient of high risk of
developing heart failures earlier so the
goal is for early detection and we
leverage the first thing we did is we
just want to see whether that's even
possible are there relevant signal in
the data that earlier
and the diagnosis time and we look at
the clinical notes and that's where we
first developed natural language
processing techniques to extract that
and the findings from those notes are
very shocking in fact just defining from
the clinical knows where we're able to
publish in a journal in cardio cardio
failures and that's a medical journal
that clinician rate there's some
exciting findings in term of science and
symptom that in the electronic health
records two years prior to the diagnosis
and this very surprising many people
don't believe those I mean I forty
percent of patient have that science and
symptom already in this clinical notes
that two years before the diagnosis so
those make us believe we can do
something then the question is how do we
really leverage the rich EHR information
so we be the integrated data analysis
tools to integrate diagnosis lab measure
and medication and also clinical notes
together to build a very rich patient
profiles then score those patient
profiles using advanced machine learning
techniques to build a predictive model
and that helped us to develop this very
accurate predictive model that can
predict our failures diagnosis six to
twelve months before the actual
diagnosis</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
