our weather icons through sunshine with
images downloaded from the internet of
course before we can use glide with
anything we'll need to add the library
to our project in fact we use the same
approach as we did with the support
annotations library adding in the single
dependency needed for Glide with just
that change we can now use glides
throughout our project so what does it
take to replace our code for loading
icons with a call to glide let's take a
look at the detail fragment as an
example in this case we're using a
utility method to retrieve the correct
resource ID based on the weather
condition ID so what does glide look
pretty similar in fact will create a
glide instance passing in either a
context activity or in this case
fragment and use load passing in the URL
of the image to load conveniently
provided by different utility method
then we'll request the glide load that
image into our image view just like that
we've written everything we need to
download cash format and display the
loaded image in our app not bad for
three lines of code of course we
probably also want to ensure that the
app works even if there isn't a network
connection and we haven't cashed
anything for that we can use the error
method to fall back to our local image
resources glide offers a number of
convenience methods like this to allow
placeholder images crossfading Center
cropping and more but this will work
great for what we need for sunshine
there is one caveat when we use an image
view with wrap content and we set the
image view via set image resource we're
actually taking advantage of some
built-in functionality where the image
view would automatically resize self
based on the images dimensions however
when loading images from the network
will need to set a specific flag adjust
view bounds this ensures that after
glide loads the image from the
downloaded bitmap the image view will
adjust its view bounds to match so what
changes when we don't have an image view
brought up at the beginning that getting
images into our notifications is a
slightly different problem we
need to get a bitmap to add as our large
icon what does this mean for glide most
of this should seem familiar create a
glide instance load from a URL fall back
to our local art resource if an error
occurs there is a few new methods in
here as bitmap is what tells glide to
load the image as a simple bitmap turns
out the glide can also load animated
gifts which unfortunately don't work for
our notification large icon then instead
of using into with an image view we pass
in a fixed width and height this is what
tells glide to load it as a fixed size
bitmap rather than dynamically resizing
it based on the size of the image view
but how do we know what size the large
icon needs to be on gingerbread and
lower devices it was a fixed size 48 DP
on newer devices we can use the provided
dimensions notification large icon width
and notification large icon height to
ensure that we always get the perfect
size then we use get to request the
glide retrieve the bitmap synchronously
we'll wait here until the images
retrieved as we build our notification
in our sync adapter which runs on a
background thread it's ok to block until
we get a result definitely not something
we want to do on the UI thread make sure
to catch the interruptedexception and
the execution exception from get well we
don't expect these things to happen it's
much better to fall back on our local
art resources and crash if everything
goes according to plan we'll have a
perfectly sized bitmap we can pass on to
our notification</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
