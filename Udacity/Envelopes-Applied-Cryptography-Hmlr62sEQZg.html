suppose I want to send a message to
Alice if I just want confidentiality
well I can put that in an envelope seal
the envelope and write that it's for
Alice and to make sure my seal is good
I'll make sure that no one else can open
this and I could give the message to
Alice now the problem is if Bob is
jealous and the mere fact that I'm
communicating with Alice would cause
problems well I can't just hand the
message to Alice that would show that
we're communicating what I'm going to do
instead is use Coleen I'm gonna give the
message to Coleen and ask Colleen to
give the message to Alice so I will have
a new envelope I'll give this a Coleen
and what I'll put in that envelope is
the message I want to give to Alice and
this also has a very secure seal so no
one else will open the message and I
give it to Coleen if someone sees me
giving a message Coleen well there's no
problem there Coleen would open the
message and see that it's got a message
to give to Alice and then she could give
the message to Alice so this works a
little bit and Coleen could open the
message and give it to Alice so how well
does this scheme work so the question is
which of these properties are necessary
for the scheme that I just described to
successfully hide the fact that I'm
communicating with Alice
requires complete trust and Coleen it
requires that Bob cannot see when I talk
with Colleen it requires that Bob must
not be able to see when Coleen talks
with Alice
it requires that Bob must not be able to
see both communications when I talk with
Colleen and when Coleen talks with Alice</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
