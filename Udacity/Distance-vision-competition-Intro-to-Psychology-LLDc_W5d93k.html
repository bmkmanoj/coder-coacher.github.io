it's you're getting ready for the final
events let's go back to Susan and see
what's going on back to you Susan hi you
guys it's really exciting over here as
you can see we're getting set up with
the eye charts and the athletes are
warming up for the first site event and
how does this event work well actually
you can see the charts have letters with
different sizes on them the contestants
have to read the letters and those that
can read the smallest letters get more
points awarded they have to read those
without glasses any comments from what
you've seen so far in this event it's
actually pretty interesting how
dramatically different some of our
contestants are for example some cannot
even read the largest letters where some
can read almost all the smallest ones
yeah it looks like some of our
contestants are nearsighted how Susan
you're definitely right Andy it's a good
thing these contestants can wear their
glasses when they're not at these events
lucky indeed thanks a lot Susan</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
