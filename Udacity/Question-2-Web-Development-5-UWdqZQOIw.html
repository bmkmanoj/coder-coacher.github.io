templates we also got a lot of questions
about separating your data and your
Python information and your app handlers
into multiple files right now we're
basically doing everything in main dot
Pi which is okay because our web
applications are small enough that it
doesn't really matter but if you're
going to be writing something for
production for everyone potentially
potentially to be using then that
doesn't really work anymore once you
start getting into thousands or tens of
thousands or even more lines of code
it's just unfeasible so there are a lot
of ways you can do that depending on
what language you're using and what
template engines you're using template
ages we're going to be talking about in
another video with Python it's actually
pretty simple any Python files in the
same folder you just say import the name
of the file except for the file
extension dot PI and that's really about
it it's very simple to use I will be
linking to the docs in that too but
that's essentially all you have to do
for it and I'd recommend if you're doing
a production web application design or
any kind of serious web application
design that you want to start separating
that out into logical chunks so that
it's easier for you to maintain and
other people to maintain - if you're
working with other people</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
