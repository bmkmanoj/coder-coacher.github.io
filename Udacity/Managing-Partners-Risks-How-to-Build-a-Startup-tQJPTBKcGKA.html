partners
well the biggest one is what I call
impedance mismatch and again I've been
talking about this a couple of times in
this lecture in a start-up you barely
register on a large company's radar in
fact your entire company's staff is
probably less than the administrative
staff of the CEOs of some of these
companies and the longest of the partner
schedules become your longest item and
what does that mean well I've seen many
times large companies say well we'll
make that decision when we get to our
planning meeting and then you ask well
when's the planning meeting oh we have
that quarterly well quarterly ninety
days to start up is like wow we make
decisions in an hour and a half and so
now all of a sudden the longest of their
meeting and decision schedules becomes
your longest item and if you're working
like startup should on an intense speed
and tempo they are now slowing you down
the third thing is when you're using
strategic alliances or joint ventures
there's no clear ownership of the
customer and in fact if there's any
owner at all the large company will say
oh you know we have a thousand people in
the field don't worry we'll take care of
this but what you typically never
realize is your product to those
thousand people in the field might be a
little asterisks on page 49 of their
sales price list and again when you do
joint ventures you've got to make sure
who owns the vision because products by
committee are probably the worst thing
that could happen to a start-up and your
objectives tend to differ you need to
understand what happens in a large
company when you become piloted a
partnership were you there as a
checklist item that someone said oh we
need one of these in our catalog were
you there for someone the career to look
good or are you absolutely essential for
their success don't confuse big-name
company being interested in you with a
potential liquidity event most of these
partnerships fail and one that isn't
intuitively obvious is that great person
who you're dealing with in that
company the odds are in 15 months
they're no longer in that job because if
their career is heading in the right
direction they're going to be promoted
or moved to another job or another
division or another location and
therefore the person who is passionate
about your relationship is now gone so
if there is no underlying rationale if
there's no real what's in it for them
the churn and partners and strategies or
personnel might put your company out of
business and they'll never notice the
difference you were just a short-term
play for whoever was in the job and if
this wasn't important to their company
though it might have been essential to
yours that deal is over even though you
might have a contract the other thing
startups worry about is intellectual
property issues typically not much of an
issue in the United States typically a
very very very more varies in certain
tier important issue in dealing with
China intellectual property and and the
rule of law for trade and trademarks and
IP is not quite the same in the US as it
is in China Russia India and other
developing nations you should make sure
that you're not dealing with IP issues
in these countries as you would in the
US finally these deals are difficult to
unwind or end this might have looked
like a great idea when you were
struggling startup 18 months later when
your revenues rolling in you realize
that you gave these large companies or
these joint ventures of these strategic
partners resources or assets serve or
other things you never would have done
two years later and so really think
through what happens two years from now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
