Katie just asked me to explain to you
two terms of machining called bias
invariance they're often used as bias
variance dilemma and and here's the gist
of it a high bias machine learning
algorithm is one that practically
ignores the data it has almost no
capacity learn anything and it's called
a bias so a car would be one that I can
train in a manner which way a train it
doesn't do anything differently now
that's generally a bad idea machine
learning but you can go to the other
extreme and make the car that is
extremely perceptive data they can only
replicate stuff at seen before that is
an extremely high variance i with them
and the problem with that is it'll react
very poorly in situations hasn't seen
before because it doesn't have the right
bias to generalize to new stuff so in
reality what you want is something in
the middle you have what's called the
bias-variance tradeoff you want an
algorithm that has some authority to
generalize but is still very open to
listen to the data and that's in your
choice very often many islands exists
you can actually turn a knob and make it
more biased or can give a higher
variance and the art of taking that knob
is the art of making machine learning
