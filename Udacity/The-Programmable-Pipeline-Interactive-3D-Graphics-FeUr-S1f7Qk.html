simplified view is this the application
sends a triangle to the GPU the GPU
determines where the triangles vertices
are on the screen including the z-depth
each pixel inside the triangle is shaded
if the pixel passes the z-buffer test it
is then saved to the image and displayed
at the end of the frame modern GPUs have
parts of the pipeline that are
programmable the transform to screen
part of the pipeline is done by what is
called a vertex shader this programmable
element essentially a little computer
processes each vertex of the triangle
the vertex shader uses information
provided to it to manipulate each vertex
in some way for example the color of the
triangle at this point could be computed
or the vertex this position could be
modified if for example you wanted to
have an object inflate or explode one
operation the vertex shader always does
is to output a location of the vertex on
the screen the second half of our modern
GPU pipeline we represent here by two
stages triangle setup in the fragment
shader triangle setup uses the three
screen locations generated by the vertex
shader for an incoming triangle this
forms a triangle in screen space each
pixel covered by part of the triangle
has what is called a fragment generated
for it this process is called scan
conversion the fragments generated are
sent to the fragment shader well if you
use Microsoft's DirectX API this is
called the pixel shader instead the
fragment shader is provided information
by the triangle being processed similar
to the vertex shader the programmer can
also feed in any other data desired the
fragment shader runs a program that
typically outputs a color and a zdf
value the z-depth value is then tested
against the z-buffer
as usual if the surface is visible the
color is saved for that pixel the shader
pipeline is designed to compute the
color at each pixel that the surface
covers that's its ultimate purpose after
all creation of an image everything done
in the pipeline comes down to this how
do we efficiently calculate this color
that's what the last half of this unit
is about materials and how they work
given a material and some incoming light
you want to compute a color coming off
that material</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
