native button element reacts when it
receives input from different devices
when I go and click on it with a mouse
you'll notice that I don't see a focus
ring but when I press the tab key i do
see a focus ring now let's check out a
custom button that I've created using a
focus style notice that when I go and
click on the button with a mouse both
the focus style and the focus ring are
applied and they stick around so what's
going on here why does my custom button
not work like the native button well for
native elements like button browsers
implement special behaviors to let them
differentiate between mouse and keyboard
focus and they only display the focus
ring for keyboard focus the thinking
being that mouse users are less likely
to need the focus ring since they know
what they just clicked on now
unfortunately that same trick does not
apply to custom controls you create
yourself because I've added a tab index
to the settlement it means that
regardless of how it gained focus that
ring will always be displayed and
because I've used a focus pseudo-class
style on it that style will also be
displayed regardless of whether this
gain focused through a keyboard or a
mouse now I should point out that as of
the time of this recording this behavior
I'm describing varies by the different
browsers so it's not even consistent
when and where you'll see focus rings
and focus tiles once you start applying
them in your application so this is
actually pretty frustrating for web
developers unfortunately there isn't
currently any single cross-browser
solution that will let us differentiate
between mouse and keyboard focus in
Firefox the Moz focus ring CSS
pseudo-class does allow you to write a
focus tile that will only be applied if
the element is focused via the keyboard
so for instance I can go and click on
this custom button and I won't see
anything but when I press tab I see the
focus states that I would expect now
while the pseudo class is currently only
supported in Firefox there is currently
work going on to add it to other
browsers like Chrome so who knows by the
time you're watching this maybe it will
have shipped and this will be a much
easier problem to work around similarly
Alice and Brian cardell have written a
great article exploring this topic in
more detail and their article also
contains a JavaScript shim
differentiating between mouse and
keyboard input you can use this shim
today in your applications to split
things up and in the future role in the
focus ring pseudo-class when it has more
widespread browser support</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
