factors to look at couldn't there be
thousands or even millions of possible
variations and mutations this is true
and sometimes scientists even have a
hard time determining what the genetic
factors are for a given complex trait
especially if it has a moderate to low
heritability and this is where
genome-wide Association studies and
snv's come in genome-wide Association
studies look at snv's and other genetic
factors across the whole genome to find
correlations between specific alleles
and the trait or disorder being studied
the method is almost exactly the same as
the skin rash Association study we just
looked at in the last exercise except
instead of just one genetic factor G waz
or genome-wide Association studies look
at hundreds of thousands or even
millions of factors at once they're
looking at the whole genome this method
takes full advantage of all of our snv's
all of our single nucleotide variations
and uses them as signpost for different
phenotypes or traits and although this
can be a really powerful tool it doesn't
always yield clear results as we'll see
with an example of bipolar disorder</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
