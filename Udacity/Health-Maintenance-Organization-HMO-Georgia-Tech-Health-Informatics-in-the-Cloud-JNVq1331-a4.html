almost always used by health maintenance
organizations are HMOs there is data to
show that this provides better care
quality at a lower cost because of their
key role in coordinating care HMO
physicians almost always have electronic
patient records and have for some time
now however HMOs also almost always
provide a more limited choice of
physicians as a means of cost control
and to facilitate managing care quality
Marla like many Americans gets health
insurance from her employer at work she
didn't select an HMO mostly because she
wanted a wider physician selection and
she didn't like the idea of someone
deciding for her if she needed specialty
care she preferred to do that herself as
a result she doesn't have a PCP and gets
all of her care from many specialists
each of whom focuses on the problem she
has that is in their domain</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
