oaken's is the vice president of
advocacy policy and public safety and
patients like me here in Cambridge Sally
thank you so much for taking the time to
be with us today thank you for having me
mark I really appreciate the chance to
talk with you so we've talked before and
I'm always fascinated by the story of
how patients like me came to be so would
you tell us that story sure absolutely
you know uh it's not uncommon at all for
a one patient or a one family story to
actually be a driver behind innovation
whether it's in health care or some
other experience and for our company it
was very much that so Steven Heywood who
was 29 at the time he was diagnosed with
ALS had two brothers Jamie and Ben
Heywood and a good friend jeff cole who
at the time of Stevens diagnosis decided
to dive in deeply and figure out how
they might help to stall the progression
of his disease or in fact try to cure
his disease Jeff all of them coming out
of MIT engineer minded and
solution-oriented so they really wanted
to find some ways of being able to help
Steven through this what they found was
rather frustrating a lot of the research
wasn't available for them to be able to
get at some of the information that they
were receiving was conflicting and they
ultimately decided that much of what
they were actually learning was from
other patients and families who were
dealing with the same issues and decided
that they really needed to find a way of
being able to bring those patients and
families together to better learn and
connect with each other and ultimately
find ways of being able to monitor and
track their their own experiences
bringing that together you start to
learn about the collective experience in
the collective wisdom of everyone else
so patients like me was actually born
out of that kind of model bringing
people together helping them find
different ways of being able to solve
problem solving their own times of
living with illness but also at finding
ways of being able to connect to the
opportunities to contribute to research
and that was a big component of what we
do well there's a wonderful story about
the ALS community on patients like me
contributing to research around a report
out of Italy I think it was that may be
lithium would benefit these patients can
you tell us about that sure you're
exactly right it was a small Italian
study that was done in an indicated or
claimed actually that the
use of lithium carbonate was actually
slowing the progression of ALS in a
small subset of patients what our
patients on the site who are already
part of a community that was tracking
and monitoring their condition many of
them went to their doctors and said you
know I want to try lithium in this
particular population the doctors often
times will work with their patients to
try to determine an appropriate use for
an off-label indication so in this case
many of the patients started using
lithium in fact we had about three
hundred and forty-eight patients on the
site who were actually taking with him
under their clinicians review and try
starting to track their experience with
that and they came to us very activated
to say can you help us start to gather
the data in such a way that we can
actually start to determine whether or
not this claim from this study is right
or wrong what we learned in a very short
period of time right frankly in nine
months we were able to demonstrate with
this group of patients that the the
claims that were made in the initial
study we're not holding up that the
progression was continuing there was no
indication that the progression was
slowing as a result of using the product
and so we took that opportunity to
suggest that this was an environment
within which patients who are activated
and interested in participating in
research could contribute their data in
a very meaningful way we took it to the
next step however because we understood
that we have a biased population so our
research scientists and data scientist
spend time developing a novel algorithm
where they could match patients who were
using lithium with patients who actually
had a similar disease course but were
not on lithium so they were able to
create a control group that actually
then was useful in being able to support
the report that we ultimately showed
which was that lithium really did not
have an impact on the progression of ALS
and in fact you know for some patients
it could have been a concern because
they were actually taking a drug that
might have had adverse effects that they
didn't necessarily need to incur so it
was a great opportunity to show the
power of a patient research network so
you began with a my atrophic lateral
sclerosis but you've certainly expanded
well beyond that can you tell us about
the other conditions or the number of
conditions and the number of communities
that are now on patients like me sure we
currently have about 270
patients on the site we cover over 2,000
different conditions initially when we
came out of the first few years with
patients like me we were really
relatively small communities that were
focusing a lot on these very serious
neurological conditions similar to ALS
with MS and that sort of thing and since
then we've really expanded quite a bit
so today we have communities that are
focused on multiple sclerosis is one of
our largest communities still about
forty thousand patients we have a very
large community of fibromyalgia patients
patients for whom the system isn't
necessarily very helpful because it's
such a complex condition with a lot of
symptoms and not a treatment in sight
right now many mood conditions so we
have a lot of patients who are using the
site for monitoring their depression or
their anxiety disorders but then other
conditions such as epilepsy rheumatoid
arthritis many of those are also you
know in the thousands of patients we're
seeing more and more some of the more
rare conditions and oftentimes parents
coming onto the sites to start to
monitor and track their children who
have some unusual and rare conditions as
well so it's really expanding just
exponentially frankly from where we
began and it's very exciting to have the
opportunity to have so many different
conditions represented well this is a
health informatics course and i know
from discussions we've had in the past
that there is a lot of informatics
sitting under this beautiful
user-friendly non-technical site can you
tell us a bit about what it takes to
actually make this thing work sure it
does take a lot of engineering much of
our company we have about 80 staff now
much of our company our engineers
software developers designers user
experience specialists then we also have
the the other side of the house which is
research scientist data scientists and
clinicians who are trying to you know
bring the two worlds together in very
much in a health IT perspective so on
the clinical side for example we
actually take all of the data that comes
in from patients and we actually code
that against the standardized
terminologies that you would find in an
electronic health record can you tell us
which one sure we actually code against
most of the ones that you would imagine
so I CD sno-med we use meddra for side
effect data which is what the
pharmaceutical industry as well as
the FDA uses for monitoring adverse
events we use multum database right now
for our drug database but we're moving
more towards using our X norm again
another one of the standardized
terminologies that's within the umls
library so we're really we try very much
to use existing standardized databases
in order to be able to normalize our
data in some way so that it ultimately
could be able to be interoperable with
other systems right now that's not as
transparent on the site as you might
imagine it but when you go behind the
scenes we can then begin to look at how
many ways that people talked about their
symptom against a particular specific
clinical concept and there could be 30
different ways that patients actually
express one clinical concept so that's
actually contributing to the development
of a patient vocabulary that actually
maps back to clinical concepts and
there's probably close to eight or nine
thousand terms in there now that patient
that are in patients voice that we've
actually been mapped to clinical
concepts super I know you recently we
talked earlier about clinical research
and you were you emphasized that the
lithium study really isn't a controlled
trial in the classic sense but you guys
are helping your your users your
patients find and get involved in
clinical trials I understand can you
tell us about that I can and we have a
few ways of doing that one is that we
download every night the data from
clinical trials gov and so a patient can
look at their profile the next morning
and see based on their profile data
which trials they actually matched
against within 25 miles of their home
gives them a place to begin then we've
also just recently announced a service
that we're going to be providing to the
pharmaceutical industry is called trial
access we've learned from our patients
through surveys that we've done with
them that many of them have been invited
to participate in trials and many of
them have not been satisfied with the
experience of those who actually did
participate sometimes it's because there
wasn't enough patient oriented
consideration into what it took to
participate in a trial so what we've
learned is that by having this service
called trial access we're actually going
to be helping patients participate in
the development of trials right from the
very start so they're better able to say
you know this particular intervention is
going to be very
convenient for me to be able to do had
you considered that now another way of
being able to state that could be you
know if I'm going to have to have a
blood sample drawn we need to determine
how far away I'm going to need to go to
get that or can someone come to my home
and do that you know so there's
different ways that patients can
actually contribute practical advice to
the trial developments on
patient-centered clinical trials
absolutely absolutely all the way
through the system and actually even
also to the point where they're
participating the evaluation of that
trial how did it go and being able to
get some findings back to them right now
you put dissipate in a clinical trial
and you never know what the outcomes of
that trial were and you if you have
access to a journal you might be able to
find the publication at some point but
much of that data isn't published what
we're saying and we're suggesting and
we're hoping that the industry really
begins to embrace patients need to have
some feedback there needs to be a
mechanism that if I've contributed my
data and I'm participating in this study
I'd like to have some sense of how all
went and how it did contribute to new
knowledge so great well so that sort of
leads to my last question which is I'm
going to ask you to get at your crystal
ball or what do you see as the future of
patients like me at least that you
you're you can discuss and specifically
and I I'm not sure I know the answer to
this one has I'll be interested how do
you see patients like me being involved
in vdt the move for patients to be able
to upload their electronic records and
share their data with each other with
other clinicians well we have a lot of
exciting things going on in some of the
some of the projects that we're
currently working on it very much about
that we're doing some testing and
piloting of sensors and mobile devices
and wearables trying to figure out ways
of being able to give patients the
opportunity to have access to these
devices bringing that data into our
platform and then ultimately finding a
way of bringing that data into the
clinical record so it can be useful but
there's a lot that you as you might
imagine that goes along with that we
need to think about how do we
standardize that data how do we
understand how to code that data so
we're just really beginning to learn and
those projects are just launched we've
just actually sent out the the packages
to the patient participant so they can
start to do that active data collection
you know we see the platform as being an
environment where patients can truly be
a part of
changing healthcare system in an area
where we've never really had access to
their voice in such a systematic way
before and we believe that actually that
contribution will will really help us
achieve the promise of a continuously
learning health system without that
voice we really are if we're sort of
operating in a bit of a vacuum so we are
continuing to build the platform in that
with that in mind we hope at within the
next year or so to really have the
ability to have that interoperability
data exchange so that we might be able
to pull in data from the EHR record to
unburden the patient from having to
enter all that data and you know there's
another facet to that the base the
patient can also verify the day exactly
you know in and really reconcile the
medication list for example as part of a
helping to then achieve something that
an electronic health record holder needs
to do they need to reconcile the
medication record and this is a way of
being able to do that so there's a
variety of ways that we see our ability
to be able to take advantage of that
kind of view download and transmit type
of technology but we want it to be
bi-directional let's get data going back
and forth so that ultimately each record
is a reflection of the full 360 view of
the patient you know you raise a really
interesting point I was at a talk
recently from someone from the geisinger
clinic which is a very well-known health
system in Pennsylvania and they have an
open charting issue which allows
patients to see their actual charts and
one of the benefits they've seen is that
patients find and help them correct
mistakes errors exactly you know it's
really very common for something to be
on a record that isn't quite accurate or
for a patient to see a medication that
they may have taken ten years ago but no
longer take and be able to save the
doctor you know this is not accurate
let's fix it together you know one of
the things that I've been playing around
with this this equation and I've been
talking about it a lot lately and that's
this notion of shared data so my data as
a patient your data as a clinician are
dated together actually can when you add
that into a shared decision-making model
ultimately leads to a shared
accountability for the outcomes so that
we actually all have the opportunity to
share in the ways that I can improve my
health I can have my health be more
reflective of what matters to me but at
the same time I'm understanding the
kinds of things that are
clinician needs to know in order to be
able to take better care of the needs
that I have so well as soon as I get
back to Atlanta I'm going to encourage
our friend Marla to sign up so if you
see a woman with a lot of problems an
amoral I'll sign up you should know that
I sent her to you well the other thing
to keep in mind with that in mind is
that this the site has levels of privacy
that allow a patient to you use a
username or their real name but I would
want to be sure that people do know that
we do take great strides to be sure that
the the experience for patients is safe
they can trust the site they can feel
comfortable about being able to exchange
information so students know Kimora Lee
is like you don't I don't thank you very
much thank you they talking to you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
