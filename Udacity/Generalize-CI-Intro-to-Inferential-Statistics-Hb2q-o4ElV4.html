we have our sample mean x-bar minus the
z-score times the standard deviation
meaning we have this number of standard
deviations less than the mean and that's
what we did with Z here being 1.96 since
this is ninety-five percent and then
over here on the other side we have our
sample mean plus Z amounts of standard
deviations or standard errors so this is
what we did to find the confidence
interval however we did not subtract Z
standard deviations from the population
mean remember the original population
mean was 0 point zero seven seven if we
did that then we would get a confidence
interval for the original population
mean and that's not what we're
interested in this third one we have our
sample mean minus and instead of Z we
have the actual Z value 1.96 times the
standard error so we have 1.96 standard
errors less than this sample mean so
that is what we did and same with over
here we have 1.96 standard errors plus
the sample mean and this one doesn't
really make sense because we can't just
subtract the number of standard
deviations we need to multiply this
number of standard deviations by what
the standard deviation actually is to
find the distance away from the sample
mean we need to go hopefully that makes
sense great job</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
