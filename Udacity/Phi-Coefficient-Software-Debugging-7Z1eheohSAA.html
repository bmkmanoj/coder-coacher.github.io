correlations the Pearson correlation
coefficient is perhaps the best-known
indicator of correlation but this is
suitable only for linear dependence that
is if you have two ranges of values what
we want instead is a correlation between
two binary values on one side we have
the outcome of the run either fail or
pass and then for each line we know that
it's either covered or uncovered and we
want to come up with a correlation
between coverage on one side and outcome
of the run on the other side so the
Pearson correlation coefficient is not
appropriate for this but there's another
measure for such correlation and it was
also invented by Pearson it's called the
Phi coefficient the Phi coefficient
starts with the table in this table you
count how frequently a line was covered
in failing runs as well as in passing
run and of course you also count how
frequently it was not covered in failing
run as well as in passing runs these
four values take the names n 1 1 and 1 0
and 0 1 and 0 0 respectively where the
first digit stands for covered versus
uncovered and the second digit stands
for fail versus pass he also computes
sums over all rows as well as sums over
all columns as well as the total sum of
events this then is the Phi coefficient
it consists of multiplying the values in
the in the first diagonal and
subtracting the product of the second
diagonal this is then normalized
according to the square root of the sum
over the columns and rows the Phi
coefficient is high if one diagonal has
a high value and the other diagonal has
a low value if it's this diagonal which
has a high value that's down here then
it becomes positive if it's this
diagonal which has a high value then it
becomes negative so the higher the value
in one the Argan o and the lower the
value in the other diagonal the stronger
the correlation our plan now is we
compute the Phi correlation for each
line and then we rank the lines
from high correlation to low correlation
and we start of course with the
strongest correlation let me illustrate
how the five coefficient is computed on
a simple example let's assume we have a
line in our program and a number of runs
in the first run line 10 is executed and
the run fails so what we enter in the
table for this line is that we now have
seen one instance where it's covered and
failed next thing that happens with this
line is that it's not covered in the run
passes so we add a 1 in this part of the
table next thing we see it's covered and
it failed so the veil unit table becomes
2 and then again we see uncovered and it
passes so now we have seen two instances
of the line being uncovered and passing
let's assume these are just the four
runs that we observe then we have seen
no instance of the line being covered in
passing and no instance of the line
being uncovered and failing let's
quickly sum up the remaining rows and
columns we have seen two instances where
the line was covered and to where it was
uncovered we have seen two instances
where it failed and two instances where
it passed total number of events is 4</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
