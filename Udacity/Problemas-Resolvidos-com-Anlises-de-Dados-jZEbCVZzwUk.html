analyzing Udacity student data but
before you get started on that let's
talk about some of the other kinds of
problems you might solve as a data
analyst
when many people hear the term data
analyst they picture someone who works
at a tech company and probably in
Silicon Valley many data analysts do in
fact work at tech companies for example
Netflix uses data analysis to provide
personalized movie recommendations for
its users Facebook uses it in their
newsfeed ranking algorithm and OkCupid
uses it to predict which people are
likely to be good romantic matches in
addition to building these kinds of
systems many companies also use data
analysis to publish papers or write blog
posts about their findings for example
Facebook has studied the ideological
diversity of people's political posts
they found that when posts appear on
people's news feeds written from a
different perspective users are less
likely to click on those posts OkCupid
wrote a blog post about what are the
best questions to ask someone on a first
date did you know that long-term couples
are very likely to agree about whether
they like horror movies data analysts
don't just work at tech companies though
Walmart looks through their purchase
records and people's posts on social
media in order to figure out what to
stock in their stores apparently
strawberry pop-tarts are more likely to
sell out right before our hurricane Bill
James is famous for applying data
analysis to baseball he used it to
understand who are the top performers
and how can you best predict future
performance and pharmaceutical companies
have started using machine learning to
predict which chemical compounds are
most likely to make effective drugs
using this they can make better
decisions about which compounds are
likely to be a good use of the resources
involved in running a clinical trial if
you'd like to learn more about any of
these applications check out the links
