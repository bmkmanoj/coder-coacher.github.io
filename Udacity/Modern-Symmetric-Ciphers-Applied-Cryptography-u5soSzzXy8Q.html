modern symmetric ciphers in this course
there's a couple reasons for this one is
that I want to get on to uses of ciphers
which i think is more important and more
interesting for most people very few
people today need to implement a cipher
you really should use library
implementations of ciphers in any
serious application it's certainly
useful to understand more about what's
going on beneath the scenes but even
fewer people should be designing new
ciphers you would have to have very
unique requirements to think that you're
better off designing a new cipher
yourself then using a standard well
accepted carefully analyzed cipher so
most of the time we've used ciphers as
black boxes that are taking in messages
and keys and outputting ciphertext and
assuming that they have the properties
that we need certainly we've proven that
no cipher really does we've shown that
the only way for a cipher to be perfect
is if the key space is at least as big
as the message space and that's
impractical for any useful use we can
group modern ciphers into two types
their stream ciphers and block ciphers
and the difference is a stream cipher
we've got a stream of data and our
cipher can encrypt small chunks at a
time you can think of the data streaming
through the cipher encrypting usually at
the level of one byte at a time
whereas the block cipher we think of our
data in larger chunks and the cipher
encrypts a block at a time and usually a
block size is at least 64 bits can be
longer up to 128 or 256 bits these are
sort of really the same thing right the
only difference is changing the block
size if the block size was small enough
it would become a stream cipher if the
block size is large enough we can think
of it as a block seikar cipher but
there's enough differences in the way
you build ciphers that different ciphers
are designed for each purpose the most
important block cipher today is known as
AES and this stands for the Advanced
Encryption standard and AES is a block
Seifer it works on blocks of 128 bits
AES is the result of a competition that
was run by the United States National
Institute of Standards and Technology
more commonly known as NIST and this
competition was started in 1997 to find
a cipher to replace deaths which was the
data encryption standard which had been
a standard for the previous 30 years
that contest ran from 1997 they had a
very open process this is very unlike
the process that was used to select DES
as the previous recommended cipher this
led to 15 submissions for round 1 and
some of these were actually completely
broken others were rejected for other
reasons this was narrowed down to 5
finalists none of which were seriously
broken and one winner which was selected
the main criteria for selecting the
winner of AES were the security of the
ciphers and this is really the hardest
thing to measure we've seen that other
than the one-time pad
provable security is not achievable for
most ciphers and not achievable for any
cipher that was a candidate for AES the
way this was measured was trying to
estimate the security and the main
metric for measuring security was
looking at the actual number of rounds
in the cipher and dividing it by the
minimum number of rounds that were
breakable in some sense and breakable
here is very much the academic
definition of breakable you didn't need
to be able to extract a message or a key
anything that showed you could reduce
the search space even a little bit would
be enough to show that it was breakable
for that number of rounds the other
properties were easier to compare and
measure which were speed implementing it
both in hardware and in software and
simplicity and simplicity is usually
against security to have higher security
we want more confusion we want to do
more transformations to the data that
goes against simplicity simplicity aids
the analysis to make it more clear
whether the cipher is secure or not
so the winner of the AES competition was
a cipher known as Brian doll which was
developed by two Belgian cryptographers
so a good thing about it winning AES is
now we don't have to figure out how to
pronounce it correctly and Belgian is
now called AES the best known current
break against AES is very theoretical so
with 128-bit keys that would mean an
brute-force attack that tries every
possible key would require on average
two to the 127 attempts
you're expected within half the 128-bit
keys so you've got to the 128 total keys
you expect to find a break after testing
half of them so they expected cost a
route force attack is 2 to 127 the best
known attack removes less than one bit
of security so that's the best known
today and 126 bits of security is well
beyond what's practical to imagine
implementing even with a huge amount of
computing resources</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
