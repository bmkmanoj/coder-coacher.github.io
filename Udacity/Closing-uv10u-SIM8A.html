then you dilate
well some of us come from the other side
of the tracks we like to dilate and then
a road
same thing with again using the same
structuring element so using the same
words from before you can show that
closing of a by B alright is it says
it's the compliment of the union of all
translations of B that don't overlap a
well that's much better shown in a
picture alright so now we take our
paintbrush B and we run it on the
outside of a where we're not allowed to
go touch go inside of that and what
results is the new area that is that
that's been painted and one of things
that's interesting to see is you see how
this notch is smoothed out but because
of the convexity of this and the vector
I can actually move this around very
precisely right around that so this is
these external corners are preserved ok
so it it fills up sort of concave
corners but it remained it keeps convex
ones there so again if I run that brush
over and over and over again I'm gonna
get the same painting that I got before
and again it's ident or idempotent pick
your favorite okay
the repeated operation has no effect so
here's an example of doing closing take
an image threshold it close it and you
get what you might say is a pretty
reasonable outline of the boundary
you'll notice it did catch some of this
shadow well that's because your
threshold pulled up some of the shadow
so again you know it's effective in a
variety of ways of sort of cleaning
things up it's not likely to give you
sort of perfect image processing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
