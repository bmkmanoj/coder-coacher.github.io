techniques for scaling different
approaches you may take in a particular
problem so the first thing you should
think about is optimizing your code you
know if if you have the option between
buying a second machine and figuring out
how to have two machines working
together on your website versus making
your code twice as fast you know maybe
it's maybe it's easier to optimize your
code you know there are some trade-offs
here the cost of a machine plus the
maintenance of having multiple machines
that means you need to figure out you
know you have to administrate these
machines make sure they're up configure
them make two machines work together all
that stuff versus cost per developer
that is development time you know it
takes take some effort to optimize your
code and you know paying people to do
that or paying yourself or you know
considering the value of your own time
for optimizing code versus adding
another machine you know there's a
trade-off there and that's something you
should think about at my company that's
something we think a lot about you know
what does it cost to pay a developer and
what does it cost just to add another
machine so kind of a big trade-off there
we're not gonna spend a whole lot of
time on this on code optimization in
this lecture because that's really just
learning how to program better you know
as you get more experienced programming
you'll be able to write better in an in
tighter code and you know as you
understand how compilers work you can
start getting even more clever and etc
etc so I won't be covering it in this
lecture but you'll get better at it as
you develop as an engineer another
technique is caching complex operations
we are going to spend a lot of time on
this in this lecture so I'm not going to
say a whole lot about it now
but this is the name of the game caching
you can upgrade your machines which
basically means you know replacing the
machines using now with machines that
have more memory more disk space faster
CPU now this is often a good option
sometimes you don't have this option at
all if you're using you know a platform
where you don't have control of the
machines but again you know something
you know every couple of years machines
get substantially fast their memory gets
cheaper disk space gets cheaper CPUs
come and faster varieties and greater
numbers so again you know just like
you're doing the trade-off with the code
optimization verse adding more machines
you have the same trade-off here
do we want to optimize our code or do
you just want to get a faster computer
this is a perfectly fine way to scale in
fact it's one of the
easiest ways to scale if you have a
system for replacing one machine with
another without breaking your website or
maybe you want to break your website for
a little bit while you do this
so anyway something to keep in mind
sometimes it's an option sometimes it's
not you know it's not as fun as
optimizing your code but it's often
cheaper and easier and finally another
approach is to add more machines which
will also be spending a fair amount of
time on in this lecture
you know the optimizing code and
upgrading machines are fairly
straightforward you know do it when you
can caching and dealing with multiple
machines working together in a system
are more difficult but ultimately you'll
have to do them at some point as your
website gets large enough and that is
what will be spending the most time on
the structure is how these two things
fit together ok so let's move on to
caching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
