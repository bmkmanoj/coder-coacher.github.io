performance loss with the microkernel
based design mainly because of the
border crossings that is going across
Hardware address spaces can be quite
expensive first there is this explicit
cost of switching the address space from
one hardware address space to another
Hardware address space that is the
explicit cost in addition to the
explicit cost of going across address
spaces there are implicit costs involved
in this border crossing and that comes
about because of change in locality we
are going from one Hardware address
space to a different Hardware address
space and that changes the locality of
execution of the processor and that
means that the memory hierarchy the
caches in particular close to the
processor may not have the contents that
are needed for executing the code and
accessing the data structures of a
particular server different from the
application a change in locality is
another important determinant of
performance and it can adversely affect
the performance and also when we are
going across address spaces to ensure
the integrity of the system either the
microkernel or the server that is living
on top of the microkernel there may be a
need to copy from user space to system
space and those kind of copying of data
from the applications memory space into
the microkernel and back out to a server
process all of those can result in
affecting the performance of the
operating system whereas in a monolithic
structure since all the components are
contained within the same address space
it is much easier for sharing data
without copying and that's one of the
biggest potential sources of performance
loss when we have this microkernel based
structure</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
