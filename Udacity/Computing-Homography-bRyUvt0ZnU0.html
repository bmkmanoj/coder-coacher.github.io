harm ography let's start off my two
images from my scene again again this is
the Lord's Cricket Ground and what I'm
going to do is I'm going to focus in on
a specific region let's say this region
here and this region here the reason I'm
actually picking these because there is
a nice planar rectangle in that region
and we can actually use that as an
example let's zoom these regions up so
we'll take this as one of our images and
the second one would be this one and
let's look at them a little bit more
carefully so here is my two regions
zoomed and zoomed in a little bit of a
left pan was done to kind of find this
one this is my equation we know
everything about it by now what we're
really interested in is computing a new
P prime from using the transformation
from the original piece
let's find four points in this one and I
did say there was a reason I found this
region because now actually I can find
four points at the corners of this sign
that was on the grass I can find the
same four points here so P prime would
be here P is here all right so these are
all X wise and these would be of course
in my new coordinate system X prime Y
prime using just this equation
homogeneous coordinates so again all
these and all P Prime's so to compute
the homography H here given pairs of
corresponding points in the two images
we need to set up any set of equations
where the parameters of H are unknown so
in essence this is my two sets I go
slowly get the information about what
these locations are what I actually
don't know is what H would be between
those two images right so that's what we
want to compute we want to actually
model the transformation that goes from
this to this because if I know this
transformation I can use this for
variety of things</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
