programming is look at this toaster what
can I do
okay the toaster can toast good toaster
what about this computer a computer can
run programs why is that better why do
we say we're in the computer age and no
one says that we in the toaster age a
better way to describe that is that a
computer can do any instructions that
you give it whatever you tell the
computer to do it will do it and that
makes the computer such a universal
device that can manipulate images text
sounds and much more whereas a toaster
can just toast there's just one catch in
order to tell the computer what you want
it to do you have to speak its language
you're going to learn how to tell the
computer what you want it to do in the
language that the computer understands
and that's a great thing because now
you're the master of the machine and it
will do for you
quickly and reliably any number of tasks
that you would find tedious or difficult
to do on your own</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
