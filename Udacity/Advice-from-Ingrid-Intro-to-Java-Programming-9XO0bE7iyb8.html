of advice that I'd give for someone
learning how to program is it's okay to
look stupid like it's okay not to know
what you're doing like it's it's funny
um one of my big things going in to like
learning how to program was I had pride
issues where I was like I don't want to
look dumb I don't want to ask for help
and ask you for help like whether it's
you know googling it like googling his
best friend when it comes to things I
don't know or you know even just asking
someone next to me like hey can you look
over this code or forums like there's so
many things are so many resources out
there that are available and you know
everyone's constantly learning that's
the thing is that like for me like
looking back the people that I was
asking now that I know like you know
what year they were when I was asking
it's like wow they are where I am now
and they were still learning I'm still
learning and so just knowing that it's
like it's okay you know people you're
always gonna have something that's gonna
be like oh you're new but that's okay
you like you got to start somewhere</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
