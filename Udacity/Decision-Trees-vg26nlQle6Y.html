table is called a decision tree it's a
form of a flowchart in which the
decisions are taken sequentially and the
resultant output can be seen as a path
through the tree it's exactly the same
information as in the decision tree but
you're seeing it in a different form in
the decision tree we'll see in just a
second there are two kinds of nodes
diamonds denote decisions and rectangles
denote the actions that are going to be
taken based upon the decisions that are
made the arcs in the diagram indicate
the implications when a decision is
answered in a particular way either
affirmatively or negatively note that in
the decision tree you're about to see
some of the nodes have been duplicated
this is a side effect of the redundancy
which occurs in the table as well here's
the tree for the previous situation on
the left is the decision about the
master control and the on the rightmost
is the resultant response from the
system in terms of what lights are on
what lights are off once again same
information is in the decision table
note that the two right most diamonds
contain exactly the same question and
that's it for combinatorial
combinatorial logic as you can well
imagine as the number of possibilities
for the input goes up these tables
quickly become unmatch unmanageable</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
