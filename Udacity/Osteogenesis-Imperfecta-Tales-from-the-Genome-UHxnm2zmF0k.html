osteogenesis imperfecta oh I sometimes
known as brittle bone disease now people
with oh I are born with defective
connective tissue or sometimes without
the ability to make it usually because
of a deficiency in collagen now you may
have heard of collagen before and maybe
even commercials or something like that
but when we talk about collagen it's a
huge and important structural protein in
your cells it's kind of what makes your
skin so pliable and durable all at the
same time it serves many important
structural purposes and in the case of
osteogenesis imperfecta it doesn't work
the way it normally should now the
incidence of OA is about one in every
twenty thousand live births let's take a
look at our fictional individual Sadie
who has a European American background
and here is a fictional pedigree of
Sadie's family here we see that sadie is
is not affected by oh i but her brother
her mother her maternal uncle and her
maternal grandmother are all affected by
osteogenesis imperfecta now just like
we've done for the last two traits
before we get into the genetic cause
here first i want you to tell me a
little bit about the inheritance pattern
of oh i base on the pedigree shown here
and what you've learned about
inheritance patterns i want you to tell
me if you think that this trait
resembles an autosomal sex-linked or
maternal inheritance pattern and then
don't you to identify whether or not you
think it's dominant or recessive if you
have any trouble answering this you can
go back and check out lesson five where
we first learned about pedigrees and
this kind of dominance</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
