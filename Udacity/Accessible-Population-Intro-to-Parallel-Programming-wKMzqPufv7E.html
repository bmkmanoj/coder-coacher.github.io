figure out the best place is to open a
chain of stores in the United States so
let's say you have a list of cities in
the United States and here I I went and
traced a map from the United States I
can't draw this well I traced a map onto
the tablet and I I dotted in I think
this is the 50 largest cities in the US
and let's say that you're trying to open
a chain of stores across the United
States and you want to know the
accessible population of each city
meaning how many people could easily get
to a store in this city so let's define
accessible population as all the people
that live in cities within 300
kilometers of this city so these are
people who could you know go for a long
drive and get to your store how are we
gonna find the accessible population of
each city you could launch a thread for
each city and have it look at every
other city you get the idea and then it
could compute the distance to all those
other cities and if it's under 300
kilometers then add the population of
that other city to a running total so in
practice most of these would be more
than 300 kilometers away and you just
discard them that would be really
inefficient right you can imagine that
having every city check every other city
I've only drawn 50 cities here if I'd
drawn you know the two thousand or three
thousand or 10,000 cities that actually
exist in the United States this would
quickly become way too much work so
instead we could create a spatial data
structure such as overlaying if say a
300 kilometer grid onto the map and then
creating a list of cities that fall into
each grid cell so this set would be
empty this one would have three cities
this one would have one two three four
cities I think that one has three this
one has one and so on right so we could
make a list of all of the cities that
fall into each grid cell and now if you
want to find all cities within 300
kilometers of a given city say Denver
here you only need to look at the grid
cell that that city falls in and the
neighboring cells right so I need to
check these three here there's two
cities so close together you can't even
tell that's Denver and Boulder I need to
check these cities so I still have
several checks to make but this is still
vastly fewer checks than I would have to
make if I were checking all of the all
of the cities against all of the all of
the other cities so by creating
these grid cells these bins that contain
the cities and therefore being able to
restrict which sections which bins I
need to look in i've drastically reduced
the amount of work that i need to do to
define this accessible population that
i'm trying to figure out so this is a
great example of binning so let's have a
quiz which of the following operations
would probably benefit from the
geographic binning stage described above
suppose that for all US cities in the
list we wanted to compute a histogram of
city distances from a central warehouse
in Denver Colorado what if you had a
list of roads each of which was
represented as a list of line segments
and you wanted to compute the population
of cities within 20 kilometers of that
road would it help to use the geographic
binning that we described most US cities
are in Geographic administrative
divisions called counties to give you a
sense of what a county is if you're not
from the US I've pulled out the
Wikipedia map of US counties and I've
zoomed in so you can see some of the
counties in our states and as you can
see there's thousands of counties
there's about 3,000 counties across the
US so given a list of counties and a
list of cities each of which contains an
index to the containing County the
county that it's inside what if you
needed to compute the city-dwelling
population of all counties with this
geographic binning operation help</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
