four level page table quiz we have 2 to
the 64th bytes of address space we have
2 to the 16th bytes in each page we get
that there are 2 to the 48th pages in
our address space for a flat page table
the page table has 2 to the 48 entries
times the size of each entry is 2 to the
third so the overall size is 2 to the
51st bytes so the answer is here 51 this
is an enormous page table many many
terabytes of page table now let's see
what the 4 level page table looks like
the page number in this page table is
split across 4 levels so the page number
is split into four pieces of 12 bits the
easiest way to figure out how large the
overall page table is is to figure out
how many innermost page tables we have 4
gigabytes worth of memory is 2 to the
32nd bytes which is 2 to the 16th pages
of this size so we have 2 to the 16th
pages 1 innermost page table has 2 to
the 12 entries so it covers 2 to the 12
pages to cover 2 to the 16th consecutive
pages we need 2 to the 4th of these
innermost page tables so now we know
that we have 16 innermost page tables
how many page tables at the next level
we need to point to them well each table
at that entry can also have 2 to the
12th
entries and this is only 2 to the 4th so
we need only 1 so this is the page table
situation we have the outermost page
table has 2 to the 12 or 4096 entries
but only one of them the first one
actually has a page table at the next
level that page table at the next level
also has 2 to the 12 entries but only
one of them the first one points to the
next level of page table that next level
page table
has 16 entries that point to innermost
page tables so overall the number of
these page tables is one here one here
one here and 16 of these for a total of
19 of them the size of each of these
small page tables is the number of
entries 2 to the 12 times the size of an
entry 2 to the third so the size of each
one of these is two to the 15th bytes
which corresponds to 32 kilobytes so
overall we have 19 page tables at
various levels each of which is 32
kilobytes so the solution here is 19
times 32 so the final answer is 608
kilobytes as you can see this is only
608 kilobytes less than a megabyte
compare that to many many terabytes of
page table for a flat page table
organization this is why all 64-bit x86
processors nowadays use multi-level page
tables of at least three levels</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
