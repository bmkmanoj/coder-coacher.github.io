fairness meaning every sender gets their
fair share of the network resources and
efficiency meaning that the network
resources are used well in other words
we shouldn't have a case where there are
spare capacity or resources in the
network and senders have data to send
but are not able to send it so we'd like
the network to be used efficiently but
we'd also like it to be shared among the
sender's we can represent fairness and
efficiency in terms of a phase plot
where each axis represents a particular
user a particular sender's allocation in
this case we just have two users one and
two and we represent their allocations
with X 1 and X 2 if the capacity of the
network is C then we can represent the
optimal operating line as X 1 plus X 2
being some constant C anything to the
left of this diagonal line represents
under utilization of the network and
anything to the right of the line
represents overload we can also
represent another line x1 equals x2 as
some notion of fair allocation so the
optimal point is where the network is
neither under or over utilized and when
the allocation is fair so being on this
diagonal line represents efficiency and
being on the green diagonal line
represents fairness we can use the phase
plot to understand why senders who use
additive increase multiplicative
decrease converge to fairness the
sender's also converge to the efficient
operating point let's suppose that we
start at the operating point shown in
blue at this point both senders will
additively increase they're sending
rates additive increase results in
moving along a line that is parallel to
x1 and x2
since both senders increase their rate
by the same amount
additive increase will continue until
the network becomes overloaded at this
point the senders will see a loss and
perform multiplicative decrease in
multiplicative decrease each sender
decreases its rate by some constant
factor of its current sending rate for
example suppose that each one of these
senders decreases its sending rate by
half the resulting operating point is
shown by this second blue dot note that
that new operating point as a result of
multiplicative decrease is on a line
between the point on the efficiency line
that the sender's hit and the origin at
this point the sender's will again
increase their sending rate along a line
that's parallel to x1 equals x2 until
they hit overload again at which point
they will again retreat towards the
origin you can see that eventually the
sender's will reach this optimal
operating point through the path that's
delineated by the blue line to think
about this a bit more you can see that
every time additive increase is applied
that increases efficiency
every time multiplicative decrease is
applied that improves fairness because
every time we apply multiplicative
decrease we get closer to this x1 equals
x2 line</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
