equals ax squared plus BX plus C is the
equation of a parabola written in
standard form because this contains two
variables x and y we can use it to graph
points on a two-dimensional coordinate
plane for any value of x that we might
want to consider we can come up with a
corresponding value for y and then of
course plot that point on our plane we
can't do that with this equation over
here because there is no variable on the
left side the only variable in the
quadratic equation is X so clearly the
equation of a parabola relates y 2x
whereas the quadratic equation does not
however the quadratic equation is really
powerful and useful for us in its own
ways it gives us a very straightforward
way for finding the x coordinates of the
X intercepts of the parabola that it
corresponds to and of course we could
find that equation the equation of the
parabola by replacing the zero with y
again the other thing that's very useful
about a quadratic equation is that it
can actually be solved because we have
one variable X in this equation and
there's only one equation we can isolate
X and find some number of values that it
needs to equal in order to make this
equation true so although equation of
parabola can yield a graph a quadratic
equation can yield solutions for values
of x that tell us a lot about these
graphs of parabolas I know this is a
really subtle distinction so if this
seems a little bit confusing at all that
makes perfect sense I myself mess this
up several times several crucial times
before I really got the difference so
just keep reminding yourself of the
distinction and when we use each one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
