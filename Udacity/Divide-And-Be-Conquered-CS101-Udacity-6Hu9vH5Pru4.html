our definition and let's try this out so
we'll print the result of Fibonacci 0
first we should get 0 which we do we'll
try Fibonacci 1 we get 1 so we've seen
our two base cases now when we do
Fibonacci two what we should get is the
result of Fibonacci 1 which is 1 plus
Fibonacci 2 minus 2 which is Fibonacci 0
which is 0 so we should get 1 again
which we do and now let's try printing
Fibonacci 3 we get 2 and if we print
Fibonacci 4 we should get 1 plus 2 which
is 3 which we get and if we try 5
we should get 2 plus 3 which is 5 and
let's try something a little bigger
let's slice Fibonacci 10 we get 55
we'll try Fibonacci 25 so we'll try
Fibonacci 24 so for County months that
would be the number of rabbits in two
years and we get 46,000 and let's try in
3 years our program times out so I'm
going to try this soon in the Python
interpreter we'll see we can do slightly
bigger ones but the time it takes to
solve Fibonacci this way is very long
and the reason for that is because we're
doing lots and lots of redundant
calculation so if we look at what our
code is doing every time we call
Fibonacci n what's happening is we're
calling Fibonacci n minus 1 and we're
calling Fibonacci n minus 2 so we're
starting we're calling Fibonacci 36 that
was an example where the interpreter
didn't finish and what we'll get is
that's gonna be broken down into calling
Fibonacci 35 plus the result that we get
from calling Fibonacci 34
each of those is another called the
Fibonacci so the call to Fibonacci 35
well that will be broken into calling
Fibonacci 34 and adding that result to
what we get from calling Fibonacci 33
and when we do Fibonacci 34 here well
that's gonna be turned into calling
Fibonacci 33 and adding the result to
Fibonacci 32 okay so I think you get the
idea
we're going to do lots and lots of
calculations here and we haven't got
close to getting down to fib l1 or fib
of 0 which is the only places that we
stop if we look at the number of times
we have to evaluate Fibble to let's pick
that one so Fibonacci 32 we have to
evaluate once here we have to evaluate
it once here once here once here and one
more time so we need to evaluate
Fibonacci 32 one two three four five
times the number of times we had to
evaluate Fibonacci 33 was one two three
times the number of times we had to
evaluate Fibonacci 34 was two times and
the number of times we had to evaluate
Fibonacci 35 was one time and the number
of times we had to evaluate Fibonacci 36
was one time so maybe you can see a
pattern here how many times do you think
we're going to need to evaluate
Fibonacci 31</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
