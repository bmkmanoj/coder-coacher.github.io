these lectures one of the things you're
going to be staring at a lot is the
business model canvas if you're watching
this video the first thing I suggest is
stop go to business model generation
comm and download the canvas and print
out a bunch of copies then go get a
bunch of yellow stickies and a red pen
because that's what you're going to be
using for the next couple of weeks now
while we actually do with the business
model canvas is in week one
you use those yellow stickies to put up
all your hypotheses you probably don't
have many facts yet but you can make
some pretty good guesses about what's
your value prophetess temir czar what
your channel is and what your pricing is
but what we're going to be doing is
really interesting is as you come back
in with facts we're going to be marking
up the canvas and crossing out the
things that actually weren't true and
replacing them with the things we've
learned and we're going to do that
week after week until what we end up
with is a stack of business model
canvases and what you'll find out is at
the end of the class you can actually
play back these canvases almost like a
film strip and see what you've learned
over time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
