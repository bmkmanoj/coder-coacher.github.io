reflections this is good as far as it
goes but many reflective surfaces are
glossy they're shiny but they're not
mirror like reflections are a bit
blurred one way to simulate this effect
is to blur the reflection map this
blurring is usually done in advance in
the texture stored some cleverness is
needed to properly filter from face to
face of the cube map but utilities exist
that perform this function for you think
about the blend fog specular reflection
model for a moment blin Fong and other
reflection models work by taking the
lights direction and I direction they
use these to decide at a point on a
surface how much that point is likely to
be a perfect mirror whatever portion is
a mirror reflects this light in reality
much of the world most of the time is
sending photons to any given point in
space from many different directions
look around and everything you can see
is sending light your way it doesn't
matter if the light is from an emitter
or a surface except that our meters are
usually brighter what an environment map
does is treats the whole surrounding
world as a source of light while
blurring an environment map is not
entirely physically correct it is
extremely convincing there is less of a
problem over a reflection not matching
up with what's in the environment since
you can't see a clear reflection on a
burnished surface another advantage is
that these blurry cube maps can be
considerably smaller in size and still
look good for the 2q maps i showed the
original head faces that were 512 by 512
texels in size the blurred version only
128 x 128 a lower resolution is all
that's needed since the color changes
more slowly if you want a wider range of
materials you can blur the original
reflection map by different amounts and
get different gloss textures you can
also mix and match between sharp and
blurred reflections on the same surface
giving an impression of a multi coat
material combining these ideas with
different reflectivities illumination
models and surface colors can give a
wide range of effects</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
