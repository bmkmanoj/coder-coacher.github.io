positive 2x could actually equal
negative 4 and positive 2 in this case
and any value in between them great
solving if you found this integral to
begin solving this inequality we want to
subtract 8 from both sides this allows
us to set this quadratic expression less
than or equal to 0 now we can rewrite
this as an equation and find the zeros
or the X values that make this equal to
0 we factor the quadratic expression and
then we set each factor equal to 0 to
get X could equal negative 4 or X could
equal positive 2 we use these to create
the three separate intervals on our
number line next we want to test a value
in each of the intervals for the first
interval will test the value x equals
negative 5 so plugging the value of
negative 5 and 4 X will get the
statement 7 is less than or equal to 0
now this of course isn't true so this
interval is false it's not part of our
solution for the second interval we can
test x equals 0 if x equals 0 we lose
these two terms and we're left with
negative 8 is less than or equal to 0
this we know is true so this part is
included in our answer and finally for
the third interval if we test X is equal
to 3 we'll get the statement 7 is less
than or equal to 0 again we know this
isn't true so this region is out so the
values of x that satisfy our inequality
are between negative 4 and 2 we include
negative 4 and 2 since we have the or
equal to symbol here since we know both
of these values are zeros to the
quadratic equation I hope you're
starting to see all sorts of patterns
when you solve these types of problems</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
