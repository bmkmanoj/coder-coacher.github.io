to a plus C and we've seen it all
there's nothing more in the future to
see for this particular rewriterule
coming from chart state B we've
previously seen be hidden tokens that
aren't shown here on the left and this
is all in charts today I'm leaving a and
B abstract so that we know how to write
a general program that does this we
decided we wanted to look for egos to e
plus e all the way back in chart state
be all the way back after we've seen be
inputs so if you view this as our input
or sort of the bottom edge of our parse
tree as we're working on constructing it
these are some previous input tokens
maybe previous in previous pluses maybe
parenthesis if we extend our grammar and
at this point we decided I think I'm
going to see an e plus e in the future
and now we have we've seen all three
parts of it so conceptually if it's it's
as if we've seen the e right here we
firm this up with a concrete example
let's go back in time and look at where
we came from suppose I extend our
grammars that it has both addition and
subtraction whoa-ho the power let's not
get drunk and one of our previous states
in chart be had been egos to e minus
this is where we were and we were
expecting an expression any so by
reduction by prediction we would have
added in expectations to see things like
a plus E and in fact that's where we got
this state that's why it says from B we
brought it in in chart state be based on
doing the closure here well now we've
seen enough input to actually make a
single e we've seen eep lussi that
reduces to e so it's as if we have this
e in our input and we're going to shift
over it in some sense this third
approach during reduction is like a
combination of the previous two if I've
computed the closure in the past and now
we've seen enough of the input to
actually use a reduction rule it's as if
I put an e in the input and we're going
to shift right over it so I'm just going
to shift my finger over one shift it
over this e where did this come from it
came from here
we'd finished seeing all of its sub
components we now have a biggie group
we're done with it here's the real trick
this is one of the tricky parts of doing
these reductions note which charts state
I added it to we added it back to chart
a because I don't want to forget that
we've already seen a lot of these tokens
remember the particular index we're
using into our chart corresponds to how
many of the input tokens we have to have
seen so far a was the farthest to the
right and be over here we definitely
want to remember that we've seen all of
these tokens in order to get to this
point this is the trickiest rule so
we'll do a worked example together and
then I'll ask for your input let's say
we have the following grammar if you
look carefully at it there's actually
only one string in the language of this
grammar a BB C but I've added some extra
non terminals so that we'll get a chance
to see how BB reduces to a bigger be by
applying this rule in reverse and then
we keep going into all the parsing
unsurprisingly and the input will be a
BBC the only string in the language of
the grammar its be tastic and now i'm
going to work on making the chart so
let's say we haven't seen any of the
input yet we pick our starting non
terminal and by convention that's just
the first one I mentioned and actually
this is all there is there's only one
rule for the starting non-terminal we
haven't seen any of the input yet and
this red dot is not before a
non-terminal so there's no closure
operations to do so we're totally fine
that's our entire parsing chart state
now let's say we've seen one part of the
input we've seen the first token a well
that matches up exactly with the token
we were expecting to the right of the
red dot so we get to shift over it and
now I want to go back and make sure that
we're recording all the right
information officially we need from or
position information for each one of
these parsing states so here we came
from zero we hadn't seen any tokens yet
this rule we brought over from the
previous state by shifting its still
from position zero there's nothing in
the input that's not already visible
here on the right hand side but now I'm
going to bring in the closure and we
decided to perform the closure in state
1 so we write a from one here another
way for you to think about this from
starting position is there's really one
more token the a that would be here on
the left but I'm not including it so
that's the one token we're missing here
the next input token is Abby so can we
shift on any of these rules well this
has a dot before non-terminal so we
can't do anything here but this one has
a dot before token and it's the token we
were expecting we are so happy b goes to
BB from one now let's make the chart for
three characters in the input we've seen
another be so go look back previously
are there any shifts we could do oh we
could totally shift over that be alright
so here's the moment of truth for
performing reductions we have the red
dot at the end of a rule there's nothing
to the right of it no more input to
consume so we're going to apply this B
goes to BB rule in Reverse so we're
going to look back to state 1 we're
going to use this from information where
to come from came from state 1 and see I
could turn this BB in the input into a
big be using this rule is there anyone
who wants to see a big be back in state
1 no yes there totally is this rule here
T goes to a dot big bc it's really
looking to see a big B but we just made
one by reduction by applying the rule in
Reverse so conceptually you could go
back and say oh what if we'd seen this
big be in the input we've seen it right
over here a BB instead of seeing these
two lowercase bees we had seen the
uppercase B we take this rule and
Transplant it over to this state being
careful to retain the original from
information let's just interpret this
from information starting from zero
tokens we've seen a BB in chart state
three and those are all represented
they're all encoded in everything before
the dot in some sense this lower case a
has length 1 and this uppercase B had
length to those two together add up to 3
so I don't need any more hidden tokens
to be in the third chart state so this
last part where I
from here step one went back over to
here and found this rule and then
brought it back over here one two three
this three-step process is reduction</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
