machine that recognizes L is fairly
simple it just feeds the input 1 0 0 0 1
0 into m and then accepts after m halt
if M loops then so will this machine if
it doesn't move then this machine will
accept note that it's not clear if it's
possible to recognize the compliment if
you haven't taken a class on the theory
of computation before then you might
think it possible that there are only
some dozens or hundreds of ways that
infinite loops occur and that you could
check all of those cases this is at
least unclear and as we'll see later it
actually turns out to be false
simulation deferred is recognized in
this language doesn't work either we
can't just run the machine and wait
until it doesn't home that doesn't make
any sense another possible idea is to
monitor the machine by keeping track of
every configuration that has been in and
if it ever repeats a configuration to
declare that it doesn't halt this might
detect some non halting behavior but
because the Turing machines tape is
infinite it can run forever without
actually ever repeating a configuration
students will sometimes object that this
strategy of monitoring for loops would
work on any computer with finite memory
the trouble is that it would require
more memory than the machine being
monitored it would have access to so the
monitor would have to be a different
computational model than the machine its
monitoring as a practical method of
detecting cycles this strategy doesn't
work either consider the fact that a
computer with a gigabyte of RAM has over
8 billion bits and therefore over 2 to
the eight billion possible
configurations that's a lot of possible
configurations before you detect a cycle
the bottom line is that this objection
isn't satisfactory either in theory or
in practice monitoring and looking for
cycles of configurations just doesn't
cut it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
