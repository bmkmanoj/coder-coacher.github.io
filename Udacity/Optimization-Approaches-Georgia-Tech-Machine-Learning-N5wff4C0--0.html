we actually just looked at a couple
different ideas we just looked at
generating tests this sort of idea of
you can just run through all the
different values in the input space and
see which one gives the maximum when is
that a good idea when is that not a good
idea well it's probably a really good
idea when you have just a small set of
things you need to generate and test
yeah it really does require that we have
a small input space and it's also
particularly helpful if it's a complex
function right and because there really
isn't any other choice if the function
has kind of crazy behavior like in the
mod example that I gave all right for
things like calculus like just solving
for what the optimum is analytically
when when is that a good idea and when
is that not such a good idea
well it's a good idea when you have a
function where you can do that well
first of all it has to have a derivative
right and so it seems like well how are
you gonna write down a function it
doesn't have to do really well if what
the thing that we're trying to optimize
is some kind of it could be crazy
because we defined it to be crazy we can
define it with little you know like ifs
and things like that to make it only
piecewise continuous or it might be the
thing we're optimizing is some process
in the real world that we just don't
have a functional representation of all
we can do is evaluate the fitness value
at different inputs or if the inputs are
discrete right like in the first example
right so it might not actually give us
any feedback the derivative is we're not
moving in a smooth continuous space hey
is mod does mod have a derivative almost
everywhere just not everywhere yeah
there's this you know cuz mod kind of
looks like so it has this nice
derivative everywhere except for at
these two jumps would happen pretty
often yeah there's a lot of them but
they're you know measure zero hmm okay
like if you just picked a random number
it wouldn't be at the jump so it's not
only important that the function has a
derivative but the derivative we need to
be able to solve it solve that
derivative equal to zero Newton's method
can be helpful even outside of that case
where we have a derivative and we have
time to kind of iteratively improve
right just keep querying the the
function creeping up on what the optimum
turns out to be so okay but then what do
we do if these these assumptions don't
hold so we have a real what would that
mean it would mean what big input space
still have a complex function complex
function no derivative or difficult to
find derivative you had that derivative
around here something you know it's
always the last place you find it yeah
exactly and and actually I should have
mentioned one more thing about Newton's
method which is that the function has a
derivative li improved and it really
wants you to have just a single optimum
because even Newton's method can get
stuck if it's in a situation where you
have a curve say like like that cuz
Newton's method is just gonna hone in on
the local peak so that would be bad if
you have lots of local maxima in this
case or operate yeah yeah yeah so so so
that's we can kind of list this as well
possibly many local optima right that
that the function has a kind of a peak
that things around the peak are less
than the peak but that peak itself may
be less than some other peak somewhere
else in the space so as you might expect
that our answer to this hard question is
going to be randomized optimization the
