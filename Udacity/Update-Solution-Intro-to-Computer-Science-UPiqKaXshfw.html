look up so let's start by copying that
code and see how we need to change it so
we had look up we're going to change it
to be update now instead of just taking
a key as its input it's going to take a
key and a value but it's not going to
return anything so we're going to get
rid of the returns right remember all
update is doing is modifying the value
of entry so now we still have what we
had for look up we're still getting the
bucket and we want to do that we want to
make sure that we update the value in
the right bucket we still need to look
through the entries in the bucket to
find if one matches if we find one that
matches well what we did and look up was
just return it an update what we want to
do is change the value associated with
that key so we're going to have an
assignment that replaces whatever value
was there before with the new value and
now instead of returning the value we
want to stop going through the loop and
we actually are done with updates so we
can return here we found the entry we
updated the value we also need to deal
with the case where we didn't find the
entry so now we've gone through the loop
enough times when it was a lookup we
just returned none when it's an update
what we want to do when the key is not
already in the table is added so now
we're going to use a pen to add a new
entry to bucket that has the key and the
value so that's how we defined update
there's certainly lots of other ways to
do it and one thing you should be
thinking about is well this is actually
very similar to look up right we
duplicated a lot of code maybe there's a
way to define update and look up so we
don't have to have two copies of the
code that scans through the bucket to
find the right entry we'll leave that as
a homework question for this unit for
now we're going to be happy that we've
got correct implementations of both look
up and update and let's test them so
what we did before we're going to
replace the ads with updates and now the
second time what happened with the ad
was we added an entry but we could never
reach that entry because it had the same
keyword now we've used update the second
time we should be updating that value
and we'll see that the lookup
now produces the value 27 for the second
look up that's good right the first time
the value is 23 we did the update we got
27 and we can see that the bucket only
contains one entry so this is great we
finished our implementation of the hash
table we can do updates that will either
add new values of the hash table if they
don't already exist or change the value
of ones that exist and we can do lookups
and the lookup will know where to look
which bucket to look in to find that key
if it exists so this has the great
property that adds the number of keys
increase as long as we increase the
number of buckets accordingly the time
to do both an update and a lookup is
constant this means the time doesn't
increase even as the number of keywords
increases as long as we increase the
number of buckets so the size of each
bucket stays the same size because the
expensive cost of this is going through
the elements in the bucket looking for
the key that matches</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
