92 wiper sets is equal to 598 but we
also see in the last equation that the
cost up to make 92 wiper sets is equal
to the cost to make one wiper set times
the number of wiper sets made now when
two quantities are both equal to the
same thing that means they're also equal
to each other that means we can say that
598 equals the cost to make one wiper
set times the number of wiper sets made
that's actually really just another case
of substitution so we can put a 598 in
this spot I'm going to continue to leave
dollar signs out for now just for
simplicity we see the cost to make one
wiper set both here in the last equation
and also here that it's equal to C so
we'll substitute C in and the number of
wiper sets made is 92 now we have an
equation 598 equals C times 92 there's
one slight adjustment where I'm going to
make I'm going to say that 598 equals 92
C so remember that we normally write the
coefficients just plain numbers at the
front of terms and then the variables
following them so look at that after a
lot of hard work we finally have a
lovely concise equation 598 equals 92 C
I could put a nice little box around
that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
