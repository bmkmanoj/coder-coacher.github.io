finishing with this lesson remember how
I said before that we can write this as
mu sub Q minus mu sub a equals zero for
the hypothesis test and likewise for the
alternative hypothesis we can say that
the difference between them is not equal
to zero
instead of writing this as a difference
we can just write mu sub D which means
the difference between these two
population means the null assumes that
this difference will be zero and the
alternative assumes that they'll not be
zero then instead of the numerator we
had before will have the difference
between the sample means and then
subtract zero we're testing to see if
this difference between the sample means
is significantly different from zero
however we could see if this difference
between the sample means is
significantly different from any value
not just zero maybe we want to test if
the difference between sample means is
six usually though we're looking to see
if the difference is different from zero
you'll get more practice with this
notation and the problem sets great job</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
