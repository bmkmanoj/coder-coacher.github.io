originally but i live in san francisco
now i have darkly pigmented skin and i
live in an area that had a high
prevalence for sickle cell anemia first
of all kenya's in East Africa and it's
right under the Horn of Africa so under
Somalia and above Tanzania and we have
the Indian Ocean to our East so if
you're closer to the coast it's much
hotter it's just hot at the codes
especially in January and we're right on
the equator the country is actually
almost split in half by the line equator
line and if you live up in the highlands
like I do which is on the slopes of
Mount Kenya the temperature doesn't very
much so it will only be a few degrees
Celsius different for morning to evening
and so you can wear a sweater or not if
you want or not and it's beautiful
should check out the Kenyan government
website for more information lots of
lions and people in different continents
on the globe have different color skin
and that is caused by the different
amounts of melanin that they have
deposited by melanocytes into the skin
itself so give us some some idea you
know in Kenya are most people do they
have dark skin do they have light skin I
would say most people have dark skin
because it I guess it's is it a sliding
scale what'swhat's dark skin and what's
not dark skin but most people would
probably be on the end where your skin
is considered dark I had the advantage
or disadvantage of going to an
international school when I was younger
and so there were a lot of Europeans or
people who were both European and
African descent and so I don't know when
I first realized the difference I don't
remember except maybe when I came here
and the absolute opposite was happening
where I was suddenly the minority
whereas where I grew up people with
lighter skin
and pregnant ation we're the minority
and so I don't know I think that was my
first time to actually you know realize
is when i moved here in 2008 that oh my
goodness this plane is full of people
who do not look like me skin color such
an easy trade for people to latch on to
you know they associate lots of other
things with it and historically i think
this is mike has always been true do you
think that in general and you can speak
from your perspective growing up in
Kenya or even from your experience in
San Francisco do you think you know your
generation or the current generations
perspective on skin color is different
from past generations in a better or
worse way I think it's I think it's
better but it's also very complicated
because it's that sort of love hate
relationship that comes with a country
or people who've been enslaved or
colonized where you end up either
identifying because you identify you
connect those two traits you'll connect
the wealth and the success to the skin
pigmentation and so I hope to think that
in a reverse situation where skin
pigmentation someone with darker skin
pigmentation had colonized the country
that was full of like an African person
had gone Shaka Zulu went to I don't know
Britain or something and colonize them
that the opposite would happen and
everyone would be outside trying to tan
and I don't know I don't know that would
happen but you know I like to think that
that's how this is broken down it's not
because one is better or worse than the
other is just historically there has
been a correlation or a connection
between these two and so people have
tend to identify one with success and
one with failure it just so happens that
that's how it went down at this period
in history I really like that thought
experiment that's a really good thought
experiment to do right do you think of
skin color skin pigmentation is a
positive or negative trait in any way I
think skin color can have positives I
don't think of it as negative or
positive specifically but I do know that
when I go out in the Sun
I have the advantage of not burning or I
know that I'm less likely to get skin
cancer than someone with lighter skin
pigmentation now on the other side they
do know that if you do need the Sun in
order for your body to produce vitamin D
and in that case if you have a higher
skin you have darker skin pigmentation
then you're less you're more likely to
not have the ability to produce enough
vitamin D right exactly and I know that
there are some people who actually have
to take vitamin D supplements or they
have to actually be told to go out into
the Sun more to get enough sunlight so
that they can make enough vitamin D a
lot of people think differently about
skin color some people it's a big deal
other people it's not a big deal if you
could give advice or just say anything
speaking to that idea and people about
whether or not skin color is a big deal
or not um what would you say or what
advice would you give I think the advice
I'd give is that it shouldn't matter it
would be naive of me to say that you
should ignore it because others are not
ignoring it and so you should be aware
of how others will treat you but all in
all it doesn't it shouldn't change you
it doesn't change who you are on the
inside it's a genetic trait that simply
dictates what the color of your skin and
so after that it may have its biological
advantages or disadvantages but in the
end it doesn't it doesn't your skin
color is not your ethnicity it isn't
your race race as a social construct and
so it doesn't change who you are on the
inside it really shouldn't matter and it
would be great to say that it doesn't
matter but to sum it does my advice
would be to be who you are</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
