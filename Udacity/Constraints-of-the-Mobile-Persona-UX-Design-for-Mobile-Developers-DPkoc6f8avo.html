important in designing applications so
let's now talk about the mobile persona
now when you think about your
applications persona no matter how
different they are no matter what they
are exactly they have to inherit from
this superclass which is the mobile user
persona so that means that you need to
take the attributes of the mobile user
persona into account as well as the
attributes of your apps persona so
Isobel what are the attributes of this
mobile user persona well the first
attribute would be that they have a
finite data plan and finite amount of
battery they also have divided attention
yeah exactly when I'm using my phone I'm
always doing like five or six things at
the same time there's also something
called handedness which has to do with
how a user holds the phone in their
hands and then of course the mobile user
has a very small screen and also because
the user is moving around they usually
have very sketchy network access yeah
this is a really important one and we
will dive into this much more deeply in
Lesson four I think it's really
interesting that with these mobile
persona attributes that some of them are
actually a result of the form factor of
the phone like having a small screen
yeah yeah others are actually a result
of how our human form factors our hands
only move in certain ways our brains
actually work in certain ways which is
why we have divided attention when we're
moving around doing six things at once
and also some of them have to do with
what it means to be mobile like when
you're interacting with in a physical
environment you have things like your
network can be sketchy because if you go
inside of a building or inside of an
elevator and things like that so I think
that these attributes are so important
and they're so concrete that they're we
think of them more as constraints and
not just attributes meaning you can't
violate them at all or your users gonna
have a really bad time yeah that's true
and and don't think that because we're
using the word constraint that you're
limited in some way innovation is
spurred as a result of constraints so
it's our it's our challenge to actually
leverage these constraints and create
really compelling experiences given that
this user is gonna have finite data and
battery divided attention and all those
other limitations and we should also
sense where in the subject of
constraints let's not forget about the
power that you have on mobile you can
create amazing real-time location based
experiences that are simply not possible
on web and desktop</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
