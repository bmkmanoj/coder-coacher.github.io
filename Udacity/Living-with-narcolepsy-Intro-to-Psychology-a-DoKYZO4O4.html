Becky who has narcolepsy and we're gonna
talk to her a little bit more about it
so when were you first diagnosed with
narcolepsy probably is the end of my
freshman year of high school and I was
had good sleep habits like I had the
younger siblings so I still went to bed
9 o'clock at night 10 o'clock maybe the
latest and I was still so tired like I
would come home from school and I would
take a nap right away and I was playing
soccer so sometimes it I'd be out soccer
practice and then take a nap and wake up
and go to my next soccer practice and I
was also falling asleep in a lot of my
classes we went off fighting Nebo and I
fell asleep in it and I wasn't tired it
was the last day of school I was super
excited to be summer break and then I
went out a couple weeks later and fell
asleep like almost the same time in the
movie again for only like 10 minutes and
then I woke up so that's when I realized
like why am I so tired and then I my
parents kind of just thought I was being
like a lazy teenager and then I started
to show the signs of cataplexy where you
lose muscle control during strong
emotions so when I would laugh my mom
started noticing that my facial features
they kind of like droop because you just
can't control them and my neck would
like drop and she started noticing that
so that's when I decided to go to a
doctor so we went to a general
practitioner that we'd never used before
and we told him my symptoms and he's
like have you done juggs and I was like
no I've never done anything I didn't
even drink alcohol at all yet and he was
like so you've never done this this this
listed like 10 drugs and I'm like no no
no and he's like then I don't know what
you have so then we went to a
pediatrician and we told them like she's
tired all the time and she loses muscle
control and he's like I think you have
narcolepsy and then I went to a
pediatric neurologist right away she was
like you can't drive anymore and I was
like right when I got my permit so I was
really upset about that and then I did
the EEG and a 24 hour sleep study at a
center and lastly they did an MRI in my
head and then I got diagnosed with
narcolepsy
what is it like to live with narcolepsy
it's kind of just something that's
always in the back
I had like and my parents and my fiance
like whenever I'm gonna drive anywhere
they're like make sure you're not too
tired every day is different like
sometimes I'll have to take a nap at 2
o'clock or sometimes I'll want to take a
nap at work at like 10:30 in the morning
and usually when I do take a nap I
really only need to sleep for like 10
minutes and I'll feel refreshed
so I'll just literally lay my head down
on my desk and I'll fall asleep in like
20 seconds and I'll set a timer and then
I'll wake back up luckily on my job I
have right now I have my own office so
I'll just like close the door to my
office and just lay down on my desk but
it's something I always think about like
the other day I wanted to like rush and
go to the gym and then rush and meet my
mom somewhere and it was kind of across
town and I was like can I Drive like
should I lay down for 15 minutes and
take a nap
so I always have to think about that
when I was working at my job before this
I was like clocked out on a break and I
went into like a back room and I set my
timer and I fell asleep in like a chair
like this and my boss came in and she
suspended me for taking a nap at work
and I was like so upset I was like
here's my time I was gonna go off in
like one minute and I was like I have
narcolepsy which I wrote on my
application and then the next day I
brought like my note from my neurologist
that said I have narcolepsy and they
paid me for the hours that I missed and
everything but I was very upset when I
got in trouble for taking a nap is there
anything that you want to tell people
about the disorder I kind of like people
to know that there are a lot of
different levels and like extremities of
narcolepsy like a lot of people when I
tell them I have narcolepsy they're
really surprised and then they bring up
that one
deuce Bigalow movie where the girls like
trying to Bowl and I guess some people
can fall asleep like mid-sentence but I
can't so sometimes it kind of annoys me
that people are like oh can you fall
asleep right now like no I can't if I
try to fall asleep at any time I will
but not while I'm doing something really
about there's me when people that I
guess don't know I have a narcolepsy or
forget I do think it's funny when I do
fall asleep somewhere
and I guess another thing I want people
to know is a really odd symptom of
narcolepsy is that it's really hard to
sleep at night because I guess since you
go into REM sleep so fast that I never
sleep for more than like three hours
straight I always will wake up so I like
get a good night's sleep but I wake up
at least like 10 times a night and just
be awake for like a minute and then I'll
fall back asleep</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
