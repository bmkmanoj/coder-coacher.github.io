course pulsed or flutter shuttered like
this we might have a signal like this of
course the output we know is convolution
of this to this one and this is also a
sinc function and of course the big
thing here is it is actually preserving
all of the high frequencies it's not
going down into the low frequencies by
basically being able to do this we
actually now were able to get rid of
modeling all of the low frequencies and
high frequencies are there and this is
my sinc function again I would get this
by trying to compute the discrete
Fourier transform of an image in this
process a call again that convolution
has a lot to do with Fourier transforms
when we looked at all of our signal
processing stuff in one of the earlier
lectures here are the two signals next
to each other full open shutter sync
function looks like this and of course
our flutter shutter or a pulse charted
like this the sinc function looks like
this never gets to some of the low
frequencies always basically and again
you can see this that there is a lot
more low frequency information here and
because of the sharp lines and stuff
like that here we're actually seeing a
lot more of the high frequencies simply
again the flutter shuttered or pulsed
our cents are our shutter to be able to
get this image we are interested in of
course is the inversion right we are
trying to invert this being able to go
from this to an original image of course
we can do this by doing inverse Fourier
transforms and again in this case we can
now look at the inverse filters for
doing these types of things and of
course we look at the two different sine
functions the thing that is and this is
something I'm going to refer you to back
to some of the literature on signal
processing this kind of a filter is
unstable while a signal like this is
much more stable because again it's only
kind of capturing the high or low
frequencies in this instance and we can
represent this much better to be able to
kind of do the inversion to compute our
signals that's the basic idea here is
that trying to do an inverse discrete
Fourier transform this kind actually
would be much more suitable for our
reconstruction let's look at the
examples in this case I'm going to
basically show short exposure long
exposure and coded exposure for a short
exposure of course no light we get a
very thing but of course we get a nice
crisp image long exposure we get a lot
of blurriness coated exposure we get
blurriness but a lot more high frequency
information still there
and of course we can deep learn this
using the approach I kind of talked
about and this is what we would get much
crisper image if you were too deep
learning this with variety of different
approaches we might still get some
incompleteness or in this case by doing
it the method I was doing the discrete
Fourier transforms and stuff like that
we will get more box by the way just to
compare this is the ground truth image
that we would have had if we actually
had captured it correctly and this one
looks pretty good there's a little bit
of noise and a little bit of banding
going on but much better than this and
that's the basic idea of this flutter
shutter camera being able to kind of use
this knowledge to be able to now
reconstruct an image that knows how the
variations happen again we know the code
we know the output we can deconvolve
with the knowledge itself to help us
figure out how to actually generate a
reconstruction that's much more true to
what the original image would be same
idea as what we looked at for coated
aperture except this time of course it's
a coated shutter let's see some examples
produced by these authors in their paper
here is an example using this camera
here of basically looking at a car of
course with this car is moving fast you
cannot actually see the license plate
which is here but of course if we had a
flutter shutter camera you should be
able to reconstruct from this and
actually get the license plate number
another example of the same thing again
somebody says I want more detail here
this is the original image but if I had
a flutter shutter camera I should be
able to generate more another example
with the cars again this is the original
image let's just focus it in there and
actually the whole car image can be
regenerated and if you notice we can
actually now start looking up and start
even reading some of the numbers and
additional detail another input image we
can rectify the cropped image here and
again create a D blood result much more
crisper</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
