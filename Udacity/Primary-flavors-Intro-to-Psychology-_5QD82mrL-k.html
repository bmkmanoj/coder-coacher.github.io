creationist this is a wonderful addition
to the event so now it's time to move
into our chemical senses wait and each
time you're worried should I be are
things to be blown up that's when I
learned before you run to get your
hazmat suit the chemical senses are just
senses that are based on the reception
of chemicals so for example your sense
of smell or your sense of taste
oh so with smell the tiny particles that
go up your nose and that are detected by
your smell receptors exactly and
something pretty similar for taste
actually let's actually go to Susan who
is yep sounds like she's on location at
the taste-off now thank you Andy
although the taste-off will focus on our
sense leads ability to activate their
10,000 tastebuds the person is going to
excel in this competition is the one who
also activates their smell receptors
it's truly amazing how our perception of
taste actually depends on the sensation
of taste and smell it really is how is
it possible that these two seemingly
different senses are so intimately
related
well Andy that's because both taste and
smell are processed up here in the
frontal lobes of our brain for the taste
off the contestants are going to have to
identify samples that contain each of
the five basic flavors these are sweet
salty sour savory and bitter to do this
we'll be using the following ingredients
sugar salt lemon msg and tonic water and
Susan which ingredient is going to
correspond to which flavor</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
