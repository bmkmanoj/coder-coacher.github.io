seen inverse variation but these two
don't have to be separate there are
times when the quantities can vary
jointly in other words we'll have more
than just two amounts related to each
other an example of this would be simple
interest that accrues over time simple
interest is equal to the principal
amount we start with times the interest
rate the amount of interest that
accumulates and one year is dependent
our varies directly with these other two
values if the principal amount were to
go up our interest would also go up
likewise if we increase the interest
rate our interest would go up as well so
this is a case of joint variation
because simple interest varies directly
with both the principal amount and the
interest rate we could set up a
proportion like this the principal
amount and the interest rate associated
with the first interest would appear
directly across from it so if we had any
five of these quantities we could solve
for the remaining one or the one that's
left out let's see if you can use this
idea of joint variation to solve a
different problem</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
