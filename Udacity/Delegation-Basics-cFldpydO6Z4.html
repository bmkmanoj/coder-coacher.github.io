students when we asked them about the
word delegate is that it made him think
of a relationship between a manager and
an employee or a parent and a child
perhaps you've also experienced the
situation where work has been passed on
or delegated to you in iOS delegation
works much the same way but it can be
between any types of objects it really
just means getting one object to the
work for the other in the case of av
audio recorder it does not know anything
about our view controllers or even your
app it does know that once it finishes
recording it can inform the other class
our record view controller that it's
finished the delegate the record view
controller can then do the work of
whatever needs to be done with the
recorded audio in this way you can use
AV audio recorder as a tool to just
record the audio and it calls out to its
delegate the record view controller to
do something with it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
