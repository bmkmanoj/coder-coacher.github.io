model building that we've made is great
but I chose a certain size that I wanted
these squares to be so I'm wondering
what's going to happen if I choose a
different size square let's see maybe to
start out my experiment I'll make a
rectangle that has little tiny tiny tiny
squares cut out of the corners
so now that I have my tiny squares cut
out and then cut out some really big
ones actually I'm going to consider
first of all this box as our medium
sized corner box and for comparison i'm
just going to take the tape off of it
so medium one is back now for the really
big one or rather the really big corners
so now we have three very different
looking rectangles with the corners cut
out of them the question I have for you
and something that Athena is wondering
is which one of these has the biggest
volume when it's folded into a box or in
other words which one's going to hold
the most mms clearly we want the box
that's going to hold the most eminem's
so pick between these three boxes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
