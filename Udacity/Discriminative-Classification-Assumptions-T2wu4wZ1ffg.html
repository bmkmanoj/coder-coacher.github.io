going to be talking about discriminative
methods for doing recognition or
classification by the way I'll probably
use those words interchangeably
classification recognition probably a
little sloppy of me because we talked a
little bit about difference I'm just
basically talking about classifying
something as being an A or a B or even
more precisely an a or a not a before we
go forward we're going to make some
assumptions okay our first assumption
we're going to assume that there's a
fixed number of known classes right so
I'm going to tell you there are four
things in this universe you have to
worry about now they might be ABC's and
none of the above but it's not like
later I'm going to give you some D's or
later I'm going to give you some ease
now I'm going to tell you the classes
that exists a priori so when I train
this system and I'm defining the
boundaries I'm only worrying about the
classes that you tell me in advance that
I know about the other thing I'm gonna
assume is that I've got plenty of data
I've got training examples that come
from this class and it might not be
shall we say that data hard you know
I've got an exponential amount but I've
got lots of data so it's possible for me
to typically find points that tend to be
you know might get confused with some
other class for the conversations we're
going to have today and the next time
we're going to assume an equal cost of
mistakes so it costs you just as much to
call an a and not a as it does to call a
not a an a in fact one of the methods
will talk about the fact that some of
the distributions might be quite a
symmetric right so you might be looking
for say I don't know faces we're going
to do that one in an image you may know
that most places an image in most images
are not faces so you might take
advantage of that fact in terms of how
you search for them but we're not going
to worry about the relative cost
remember that loss function between
making the two kinds of mistakes and the
other thing is that we're going to
assume is that and this is actually good
because it's true it's always good to
assume true things we need to build a
representation of each instance so we're
going to build a description but we
don't know a priori what features
actually matter so we're going to write
down a whole bunch of things about it
each instance and then
we're going to train a discrepancy the
classification and it'll have to figure
out where the information is in the
future all right so that's a lot of
assuming but I'm good at making
assumptions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
