finally start trying to turn our ABO
gene into an ABO protein and the first
thing we're gonna do is go from DNA to
RNA which is the first step of the
central dogma via the process of
transcription so if you look here we
have our double-stranded DNA our double
helix and it's wound up we're gonna
follow along the gene right here and as
you can see as it moves across on the on
the bottom or region here we have the
chemistry the chemical structure and on
the top region we have the letters that
actually make up the same DNA structure
obviously the chemistry on the bottom is
something that's a little more difficult
to read and that's why we have the
letters which are right there on the top
model' to help us better see what's
going on here in the double helix we're
actually gonna unwind it the way a sound
normally would want a cell find
something interesting in DNA that it
wants to read more or know more about it
often unwinds the DNA a bit so it has
better access now the cell is going to
use proteins to detect where
transcription should begin and we're
going to learn more about how that
happens in the next lesson but for now
all you should know is that this
sequence region is called a promoter a
region of DNA that's read or detected by
proteins that signals the start of
transcription once the proteins are
bound to the DNA it not only begins to
unwind but it begins to separate into
single strands to give greater access
and initiate transcription our double
helix has been unwound and separated
into single strands here then for
transcription to occur it will rely on a
very basic property of DNA so I want you
to see if you can tell me what property
of DNA do you think is most essential to
make an RNA copy do you think it's that
DNA is able to associate with histones
that it can have a helical structure the
fact that it base pairs or the fact that
it's inherited from your parents go
ahead and pick which answer you think is
best</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
