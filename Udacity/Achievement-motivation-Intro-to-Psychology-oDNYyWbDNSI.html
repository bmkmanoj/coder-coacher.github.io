we also see as humans we have a
motivation to excel which is incredibly
beneficial to the workplace this is
achievement motivation achievement
motivation is the desire to do things
well and to overcome obstacles in
general when we succeed at something
that's very difficult we find it more
meaningful then if we were to succeed at
something that was easy because if we
succeed it's something that's easy then
it doesn't really tell us much about our
abilities for example you're most likely
derive more meaning from successfully
finishing a half-marathon then you would
feel for just walking a mile let's move
on to talk about achievement in regards
to motivation in the workplace if you
recall from lesson one when we discussed
the different subfields of psychology
this is where the subfield of industrial
and organizational psychology comes into
play iö psychology studies motivation
and behavior in the workplace and yes as
you can imagine employers want to know
what motivates their employees</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
