blue white and red
so here it looks like we have to make
three decisions are we in the first
third the middle third or the last one
in Java you would start out with the
first condition and I leave it to you to
fill in the details in the exercise then
for the next part you use an else--if
clause so you simply write else--if
followed by another condition and
finally you use an else for the
remaining possibility so here you need
to supply two conditions is the point in
the left is it in the middle or
otherwise of course it has to be in the
rightmost part this construction with
if-else if you could have other else if
see if you would like to and then
finally is an else is what you use
anytime that you need to make multiple
decisions they get worked down from the
top to the bottom as you would expect
the first condition gets checked if it's
fulfilled the statement is executed in
here and everything else is skipped on
the other hand if the first condition
wasn't true one would move to check the
second condition and if that one was
true it would be executed if it wasn't
then the third one would be executed in
other words exactly one of these three
blocks is executed depending on which
condition is true or whether none of
them is true well now it's your turn to
try that with the French flag again
you'll be given a point X Y that could
fall anywhere within the flag and you
need to make a decision whether to
return blue/white all right and when you
do that be sure to use an if-else
if-else construction</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
