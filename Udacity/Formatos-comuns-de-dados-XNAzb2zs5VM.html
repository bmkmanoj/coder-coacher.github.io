are CSV XML and JSON I want to quickly
discuss what one record and the lawmen
baseball database would look like in
each of these different formats it just
so happens that the first row in this
data set corresponds to a pretty famous
baseball player Hank Aaron let's first
discuss what this data looks like in the
format we originally downloaded it in
CSV in the CSV format we usually have a
series of rows with each row
corresponding to an entry there is a
header row at the top of our file where
our comma separated values do not
correspond to an entry but instead tell
us what each entry means for the rest of
the document in the case of the
spaceball document our first row tells
us that every row will have some
identifier x'
the lawmen ID the player ID the manager
ID etc then we'll see birth year birth
month birthday and then a bunch of other
statistics if we go and look at the
entry for Hank Aaron we see all these
values one for loam and ID Aaron HIO one
for player ID etc separated by commas
note that if a particular player doesn't
have a value for one field for example
Hank Aaron does not have a manager ID we
simply see two commas on a row in the
case of an XML document we end up with
something that pretty closely resembles
HTML we can have a document element
which is opened it can then have a
series of tables which are also opened
as we see here the table has a number of
children which corresponds to the values
that we just discussed in the CSB one
for llama ID Aaron HIO one for player ID
etc note that when we're missing a value
in XML things are treated a bit
differently for example since Hank Aaron
was not a manager we just opened the
manager ID field and then put a slash at
the end finally for a JSON document we
have a number of JSON objects indicated
by these curly braces a JSON object
looks a lot like a Python dictionary we
have keys which correspond to what we
would see in the header row in a CSV
file followed by values note that in the
case of a missing value we simply open
and close the quotation marks oftentimes
the benefit of XML or JSON is that they
support
nested structures in a way that CSV
documents cannot I don't want to go into
this in great detail but you can imagine
that the value corresponding to a
particular JSON key say Braves could
itself be another JSON object here's
what that might look like one final note
is to remember that when we talk about
different formats that data can come in
it's not a matter of the file extension
being dot CSV or being dot JSON a file
format really has to do with how the
data is organized inside of a file so we
could easily have data that is formatted
in JSON or CSV but that comes in a file
whose extension is dot txt
since the online MTA subway data comes
in CSV format and The Weather
Underground API response to requests
with a JSON object will discuss how to
load and process files in these two
formats while we won't explicitly
discuss loading and processing XML files
it isn't that different than the
material we'll cover with regards to
JSON and CSB if you'd like to learn more
about dealing with XML data in
particular I'd recommend you take the
data wrangling class with MongoDB taught
here at Udacity for now let's discuss
how to work with CSV files</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
