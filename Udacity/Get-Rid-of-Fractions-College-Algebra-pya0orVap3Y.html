started this whole problem off with 3
over X minus 1 over 5 x equals 7 so we
already solve the problem one way and
that was to combine our two fractions
into one and then proceed however there
is another method and it's always good
to explore a little bit more the second
thing that we could start off by doing
would be to get rid of our fractions
right off the bat now we know that the
way that we get rid of fractions is to
multiply fractions by numbers so let's
think about what numbers we could use
since X is the denominator of the first
fraction on the left-hand side let's
start out by trying with that what
equation do we have if we take the
single step of multiplying both sides of
this equation by X fill on the left side
that will be left with here and the
right side that will be left with here
you can of course combine like terms and
simplify on either side of the equation
if you want to I just don't you want you
to do anything else that modifies both
sides of the equation</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
