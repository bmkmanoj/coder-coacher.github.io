we've got again more good questions
let's get right up all right the first
one comes from boy those and boy house
is taking CS 262 as well with Miss
Weimer right and he wants in that class
they talked about finite state machines
it's a representation or a bit
underlying engine for you lurics
pressions in arms in our implementation
is that actually what we did or did we
do something different that's a great
question so we didn't explicitly show
that but there's a one-to-one
correspondence between regular
expression and a finite state machine
and and we can post some references and
some supplementary material for that but
you can make up a little table of you
know here's a regular expression say the
alt regular expression A or B and then
here's a finite state machine and I
guess one way to implement that would be
you'd have a start state you'd have to
epsilon transitions to the a or b and
then to epsilon transitions coming back
and so any regular expression
corresponds 1212 a little collection of
nodes in the finite state machine and
that means you can go in either
direction so does that mean that we've
actually implemented that well it kind
of depends on how you look at it so yes
you could say that we've implemented it
because you can show what they look like
but we aren't really creating objects
that correspond to these individual
states they're sort of existing
ephemeral e when we execute the program
rather than being defined exactly ahead
of time so in that sense no and I guess
maybe in the more important sense the
types of manipulations we can do with
what we implemented are slightly
different than what you would do if you
explicitly created these finite state
machines and particularly this
transition between deterministic and non
deterministic machines that's a little
hard to do exactly in the representation
that we had although you could do
something very much like it by starting
two men
why's your functions and so on you could
arrive at the same place as you would by
doing that transition with machines
great and if you want an in-depth
discussion on finite state machines you
