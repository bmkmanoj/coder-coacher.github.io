options that would result in a
frameshift mutation are the first the
second and the last now this was a
little bit tricky I was trying to be a
little deceitful on you here because the
position of the insertion or deletion
makes no difference so you can ignore it
what we care about is when we actually
have the insertion or deletion are we
shifting our frame by a multiple of
three or not if we're shifting by
multiple of three six nine then we're
going to keep everything down from the
insertion and deletion in frame it's
still going to be the same set of three
letters the same codons all the way down
but if we insert one letter or delete
one letter insert two letters or delete
two letters it's going to throw off
everything downstream to a different
frame same thing is true of four letters
or five letters or seven letters your
eight letters anything that's not a
multiple of three is going to cause a
frameshift mutation if you're having
trouble understanding the idea of a
frameshift try to think about it like
this very simple sentence here the dog
can eat and run is made up of words with
only three letters in them if we were
forced to read words as sets of three
letters and let's say I deleted this
letter right here the E and eat then
we'd end up with the dog can at endure
right we can't read this this doesn't
make sense anymore we're out of frame
whereas if we just deleted the whole
word eat we would end up with the dog
can and run and sure it doesn't make a
whole lot of sense to have the eat
removed but at least all of these are
words and they make sense and it gives
semblance to the original sequence this
is what makes frameshift so dangerous is
because frame shifts throw off
everything else downstream</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
