know that we are recording our voice
here in this first scene or the record
sounds view controller but we will need
that recorded file in here in the second
scene or in the play sounds view
controller we will definitely need to
pass that audio file on to the second
scene now if you look in the storyboard
we can see that these two scenes they
are connected to each other this means
that every time you press the stop
button we move on to the second scene
this doesn't really give us an
opportunity to pass the audio file we
have recorded in here inside the record
sounds view controller to play sounds
view controller to change this I will
select the segue and then hit delete on
my keyboard now if I try to build a
project Xcode will complain that this
second scene is abandoned and that there
is no way of reaching it I can see that
message right here by clicking this
triangle it says that this scene is
unreachable due to a lack of entry point
to fix this I will connect these two
view controllers I will select this
first view controller then press and
hold ctrl on my keyboard and start
dragging from this view controller to
the second one and then let go here I
will select the option show one more
time now that these two are connected
I can invoke a function called perform
segue from somewhere inside my code to
actually trigger this segue and while I
do that I can pass the audio file from
this view controller to this view
controller and I can do all of that from
inside my code I will do this exercise
in the next few videos for now let me
just select the segue and give it a name
I will slide out the utility area and
under attributes inspector I will give
this segue a name or an identifier let
me call it stop recording alright let's
go back to our slides and tackle the
second scenario this situation talks
about what would happen if we start to
play an audio conversation that has not
been fully processed by the phone yet to
understand that we need to understand
something called delegate in iOS now
Before we jump into what this means in
iOS I want you to think about what this
word means in simple English so here is
your question one more time what comes
to mind when I say the word delegate
