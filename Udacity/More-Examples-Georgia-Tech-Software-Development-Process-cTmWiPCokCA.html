the architecture of the irods
system this is a data grid system that
was built by a biologist and it's the
system for storing and accessing big
data so what I'm gonna do I'm gonna do
the same thing that I did for the Linux
system I'm gonna show you here on the
left-hand side this clean prescriptive
architecture for the irods system and
I'm gonna show you here on the right the
actual architecture of the system the
descriptive architecture of irods
so here even if we don't go and look at
the details you can see very easily that
the system is badly drifted and eroded
with respect to the way it was supposed
to be continuing with the examples what
I want to show you now is a view of the
complete architecture of Hadoop as many
of you probably already know Hadoop is
an open source software framework for
storage and large-scale processing of
data sets it's very broadly used and
here is a picture of the architecture
and I hope you can see it because the
architecture is so complex as so broad
and so intertwined and in order to be
able to represent it here in one page I
to zoom out quite a bit but also in this
case you don't really have to look at
details the important point here is that
in this software architecture 61 out of
the 67 components in the system have
circular dependencies which means that
they depend on each other in a safer way
and this is not only not a good thing
and also in this case a few developers
when shown the diagram had no idea that
the structure of the system was so
complex and messy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
