removal and I've associated by
subtracting 50 from either dimension so
this goes from 50 220 even though it
says 0 to 70 and the same is true over
here and now you can see the guesses are
more rational they seem to line up a
little bit in linear fashion and they're
certainly increasing which means people
who guessed a high weight for me today
as in the vertical axis likely also
guessed a high 8 for me last year
so the guesses aren't entirely random so
we're going to ask is how do the guesses
from last year and their Rozonda axis
correlate with the guesses from this
year I'm going to ask you what line best
describes this data and we're going to
compute this using the formulas we
learned about in class so here's a quick
quiz for you if we look at the data
between axis x and y I will soon let you
calculate the correlation R but for now
I want you to look at this and tell me
your best guess fr I give you a couple
of hypotheses minus one minus zero point
seven zero plus zero point seven and
plus one and none of those is absolutely
correct but one of them is quite close
and I think you can figure out which one
this so please check one of these five
boxes exactly one of those</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
