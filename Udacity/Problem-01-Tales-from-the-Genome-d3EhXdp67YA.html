really need to understand what a
consensus sequence is and based on what
we learned in the lesson we're going to
go position-by-position right these are
six different DNA sequences and we need
to see what is the consensus letter at
each position so in the first we have a
GGC jejeje right five out of the six
letters are jeez that's a consensus
that's an agreement that most of them
the majority are g look at the next
position right we have again five g's
and 1c so the consensus is G we have a
consensus in the third position of a
cytosine then five out of six or add
means at the fourth then five out of six
or thigh means at the fifth same thing
thymine again four out of six all of
them argh wantings in the next position
the majority are thigh means majority of
sightings in the majority are adenine so
this would be our consensus sequence of
these six DNA sequences it's important
to note that not a single one of the
individual six sequences has the
consensus sequence right that's an
important distinction that we've made in
this lesson and I hope it becomes
apparent here is while this may be the
consensus sequence right no individual
example has all of the consensus letters</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
