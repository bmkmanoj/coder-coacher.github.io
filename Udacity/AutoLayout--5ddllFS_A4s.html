want to place on screen I've drawn the
button here in green and the view in
blue let's assume we want it on the
center of the screen regardless if our
app is running on an iPhone or an iPad
pro the button should always be in the
center even when the app is on different
device orientations from portrait to
landscape constraints are the rules that
tell us how to position in size this
particular UI element so if we are to
think of placing the record button on
the center we need a distance from the
top the distance from the bottom this is
from the leading and finally the
distance from the trailing edges of the
view if you're following along you're
thinking okay for constraints and you
would be correct except most user
interface elements have what we call an
intrinsic size that is they have a built
in height and width in the buttons case
this height and width is automatically
calculated based on the text and font
size you selected for the buttons text
if iOS knows the height and width of a
UI element like a record button then it
only needs have the constraints the size
and position it that is to say if I tell
iOS how far from the top of the screen
the button will be and it can
automatically calculate how far from the
bottom it needs to be if we tell it the
leading constraint iOS can automatically
calculate the trailing constraint based
on the width of our green button so the
rule goes as follows you need a minimum
of two constraints in each dimension or
axes x and y to properly size and layout
a UI element except if that UI element
has an intrinsic size then you only need
one constraint for each dimension or
axes x and y iOS can figure out the
other constraint based on the intrinsic
size last thing to remember when sending
a constraint we're always comparing one
thing to another the record button
placement is relative to the UI view
it's contained in in other words it's
parent I've represented the UI view by
this blue rectangle outline right now
the UI view is full screen but if we
make it a different size the record
button will be still centered in that
view</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
