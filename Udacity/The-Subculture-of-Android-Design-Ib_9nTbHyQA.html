both been used to praise and ridicule
Android design so what's the deal with
them much like the New York City skyline
design and Android didn't come out fully
formed but slowly built over time in the
beginning there were years of desolation
where Android users had to wait a long
time for a first party apps and when
they finally did come in many cases they
were exact parts of the iOS versions
this all changed with the release of
android 3.0 honeycomb and its holo theme
the holo theme and it's refinements
continued to flourish an Ice Cream
Sandwich jelly bean and Kit Kat hullo
Yolo became a rallying call from the
users that expected the apps they use to
look like Android sometimes before the
next version was out of beta no longer
could you say that Android users and
developers don't care about design with
the release of Android 5.0 lollipop
hullo Yolo gave way to material Yolo we
learned in this course we really
shouldn't use the material theme if we
want to make our apps backward
compatible if anything we should say app
compat yellow you know</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
