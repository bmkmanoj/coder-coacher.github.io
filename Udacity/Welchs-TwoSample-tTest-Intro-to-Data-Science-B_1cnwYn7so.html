t-tests since we'll want to compare two
different samples in our class project
there are a few different versions of
the t-test that one might employ and
they depend really on what assumptions
we make about the data so we might want
to ask questions such as do our samples
have the same size and do they have the
same variance let's discuss a variant of
the t-test called Welch's t-test in more
depth since it's the most general it
doesn't assume equal sample size or
equal variance in Welch's t-test we
compute a t statistic using following
equation T equals mu1 minus mu2 divided
by the square root of Sigma 1 squared
over N 1 plus Sigma 2 squared over n 2
where mu I is the sample mean for the
ith sample Sigma squared
I is the sample variance for the eigth
sample and ni is the sample size for the
ice sample we'll also want to estimate
the number of degrees of freedom nu
using the following equation nu is
approximately equal to quantity Sigma 1
squared over N 1 plus Sigma 2 squared
over n 2 squared over Sigma 1 to the
fourth over n 1 squared nu 1 plus Sigma
2 to the 4th over n 2 squared nu to
where mu I is equal to NI a minus 1 and
this is the degrees of freedom
associated with the i'f variance
estimate if you're unfamiliar with
degrees of freedom again it might be a
good idea to brush up on your stats
concepts with the audacity intro to
stats course a link is provided in the
instructor comments alright so once we
have these two values we can estimate
the p-value conceptually the p-value is
the probability of obtaining a test
statistic at least as Extreme as the one
that was actually observed assuming that
the null hypothesis was true the p-value
is not the probability that the null
hypothesis is true given the data so
again just as a thought experiment say
we were testing whether left-handed or
right-handed baseball players were
better batters by looking at their
average batting average if the p-value
was 0.05 this would mean that even if
there's no difference between
left-handed and right-handed batters
since that's our null hypothesis so even
if this was true we would see a value of
II equal or greater to the one that we
saw five percent of the time when
performing a statistical test like this
we usually set some critical value of P
let's call it P critical if P falls
below P critical then we would reject
the null hypothesis in the two sample
case this is equivalent to stating that
the mean for our two samples is not
equal calculating this p-value for a
given set of data can be kind of tedious
thankfully we sell them have to perform
this calculation explicitly</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
