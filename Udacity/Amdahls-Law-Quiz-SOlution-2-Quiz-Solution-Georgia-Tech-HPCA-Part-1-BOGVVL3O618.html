and US law quiz we have three possible
improvements and now we can use on those
law to tell us which one of them is the
best for improving the branch CPI this
is our option 1 the overall speed-up is
branches are happening 20% of the time
so this is actually the percentage of
time so we can apply on the slope
properly so the unaffected the execution
time is 80% and the 20% we do effect we
speed up by how much by a factor of 4
over 3 so this is 1.33 and we get a
overall speed-up of one point zero five
the clock frequency increase from two to
three point three gigahertz is affecting
all of the execution time so we can just
compute the speed-up of this but for the
sake of exercise let's apply and those
law one- fraction enhanced is zero
because everything is enhanced the
fraction enhanced
is 1 and the speed-up we get here by
going from 2 to 2.3 gigahertz is 2.3
over 2 which is 1.15 and the overall
speed-up we get is the 1.15 the third
option is for stores the unaffected
fraction is 0.9 the affected fraction is
0.1 the speed-up of going from 3 to 2 is
1.5 and when we compute that we get one
point zero 3 4 so it's a very small
speed-up even smaller than we got for
branches so overall improving the clock
frequency gives us a significantly
higher improvement overall than the
other two options primarily because this
is a smaller improvement in terms of
speed up on the fraction affected but
the clock frequency increase affects all
of the instructions versus here we
affect only 20% of the execution time
and here we are affecting only 10% of
the execution time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
