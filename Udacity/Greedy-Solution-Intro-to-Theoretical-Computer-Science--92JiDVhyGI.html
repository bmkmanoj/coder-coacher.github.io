of a minimum vertex cover is too because
you can just take this one here and this
one here and all edges are covered of
course I constructed it that way and
that is also the size of the greedy
solution because what the greedy
algorithm will do is it will look at the
whole graph and then say oh which vertex
could I use to cover the most edges and
actually this vertex here is next to
seven uncovered edges and this one here
as well so it'll just choose one of them
put that one into the vertex cover say
and then in the next round all of these
edges here are already covered so it
will just say oh here's another vertex I
can use to cover seven edges so let's
take that one because all of the other
vertices they can just cover two or one
edge so after executing this loop just
twice the algorithm is already done and
it has even found an optimum solution
now that take two algorithm on the other
hand well that looks a bit stupid
compared to the greedy algorithm for
this graph here because what what would
it do well it takes any uncovered edge
doesn't really matter which one so let's
say it takes this one here then it will
put this vertex here into the solution
set and this vertex here so all of those
edges here are covered and that one here
as well and well it's not done yet so it
will have to choose another uncovered
edge let's say it's that one here and
again put two vertices into the solution
set and then all edges are covered so
here the take two algorithm which you
know by now is a factor two
approximation algorithm actually
performs as bad as it can so it really
maxes out this factor to leeway that
that it is given</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
