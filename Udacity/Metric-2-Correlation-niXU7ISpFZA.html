the accuracy of a regression algorithm
is to look at the relationship between
predicted and actual values of our
dependent variable Y here's what I mean
query our model the one that we trained
on training data with X test our testing
data set the output of that query is a
new vector of Y values Y predict so
based on this X test data our model
predicts this Y predicted data we can
now compare what we know to be the
correct or true data and Y test with
what our prediction was so this pair
would appear somewhere on this chart say
here so its value along the horizontal
axis here is what the prediction was
along the vertical axis was what the
ground truth is so we can plot these
pairs all the way through our data now
if this scatter plot is arranged in
approximately a nice line like this that
means we've got a pretty good prediction
algorithm on the other hand if they're
not aligned so well and they look sort
of like a shotgun blast our learner is
not so good we can measure this property
quantitatively using something called
correlation you can use the numpy
function cork ooph
to measure the correlation between y
test and y predict you'll get an answer
somewhere between negative 1 and
positive 1 where positive 1 means
they're strongly correlated negative 1
means they're inversely correlated and 0
means there's essentially no correlation
at all between them one thing to point
out here is that correlation isn't the
slope of this line lots of people think
that's what it is
correlation has to do with how well
aligned the points are with the line
that we fit so if it's a nice oval that
fits close to that line we usually have
a high correlation if it's you know big
round thing we've got pork or
