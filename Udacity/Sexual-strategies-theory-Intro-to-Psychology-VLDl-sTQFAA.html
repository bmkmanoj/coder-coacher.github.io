attraction and the qualities we look for
in potential sexual partners now
according to the sexual strategy theory
men and women approach relationships
differently and perhaps you can reflect
upon this and some of your own
relationship experiences in terms of how
you may have approached a relationship
differently than your partner we see
that in almost all societies people
engage in one-night stands or what we'd
like to call short-term meetings we also
have long-term meetings which include
marriage or extended companionship so
our committed long-term relationships
often result in marriage in one study
conducted in the United States they
found that 86% of women by the age of 40
and 81% of men by the age of 40 will
marry if you recall from our earlier
lesson on development we had a question
on the forums about the age your parents
got married and we discussed the change
across generations in regards to the age
people marry now this is just one study
in the United States but long-term
relationships occur in most cultures
they may do so at different times or
ages and for different reasons for
example in some cultures marriages are
arranged so the individuals have no say
in the matter but in other cultures
people often marry for love that is they
fall in love with one another and then
they decide to spend the rest of their
lives together</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
