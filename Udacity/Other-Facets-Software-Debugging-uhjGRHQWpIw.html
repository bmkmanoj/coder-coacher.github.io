static data how to capture and replay
user interaction and even a generic
mechanism to record and replay the
interaction with the environment let me
now briefly discuss some additional
items that are of particular importance
during debugging the key concept for all
of these is to make non-deterministic
behavior deterministic and controllable
at the same time first time if your
program depends on real dates and times
is sure to provide a means to set these
for diagnostic purposes if it depends on
real timing make these limits
controllable as well second randomness
if your program has planned
non-deterministic behavior for instance
if you're building a game ensure that
you can reproduce this at will if you
use a pseudo-random generator be sure to
save its seed if you use a true random
generator save the sequence of random
numbers third schedules multi-threaded
programs main on deterministically
switch between threads again find means
to make these threats which is
deterministic otherwise you may run into
hard to reproduce thread scheduling
issues forth physical influence
depending on your environment it is
possible that some physical influence
causes software errors if you place a
strong alpha emitter on top of your CPU
or your RAM this will likely cause
malfunctions cosmic rays may also result
in spurious errors but this is more
electronics problem rather than a
software problem so we leave it as it is
fifth debugging tools debuggers
instrument the code and alter its
execution the least they do is to
influence the real timing therefore they
may induce heisenberg's again bugs that
appear or disappear when being observed</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
