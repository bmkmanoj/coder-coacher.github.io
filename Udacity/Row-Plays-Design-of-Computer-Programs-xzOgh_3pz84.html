at it I might as well define a hand and
now my next target the next bird to
cross off the list is to define a
function row plays which takes a hand in
a row in this format and it returns a
set of legal plays from the row now
rather than just return legal words i'm
using this notion of a play where a play
is a pair of location within the row and
the word that we want to play so you can
imagine it's going to take the same
general approach that we've used before
start with an empty set do something to
it then return the results that we built
up and what is it that we want to do we
want to consider each possible allowable
prefix and to that we want to add all
the suffixes keeping the words now
prefixes of what so that's the first
thing to figure out so what I'm going to
do is enumerate the row enumerate
actually just the good bits so the row
from the first position to the but last
position and that tells me I don't want
the borders and I want to consider
playing on the borders I just want to
consider playing on the interior of the
row and so numerate that starting from
position number 11 would be where the a
is and so now I have an index number one
two three and i have the square which is
going to be a and then an anchor and
then an anchor and so on where do i want
to consider my rose we're going to
anchor them on an anchor so i can ask is
a square an instance of an anchor if it
is an anchor then there's two
possibilities if it's an anchor like
this there's only one allowable prefix
the prefix which is the letters that are
already there just to the left of the
anchor and so we'd want to just consider
that one prefix and then add all the
suffixes if it's an anchor like this one
then there can be many prefixes we want
all possible prefixes that fit into
these spots here consider each one of
those and for each one of those consider
adding on the suffixes so what I'm going
to do is define a function legal prefix
which gives me a description of the
legal prefix that it can occur at
position I with in a row and there's two
possibilities and I could combine the
possibilities into one but I'm going to
have to PO of two values returned so I'm
going to have legal prefix return the
actual prefix as a string if there is
one like in this case and return the
maximum size otherwise so for this
anchor here so this would be legal
prefix of 1 2 3 4 5 6 x4 legal prefix
when I equals 6 the result would be that
there's no characters to the left so be
the empty string for the first element
of the tuples the maximum size of the
prefix that are going to allow is two
characters now if I asked here that's
index number 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 so when I
equals 9 result would be that the prefix
is B II and the maximum size is the same
as the minimum size it's the exact size
of two so i define legal prefix in order
to tell me what to do next based on the
two types of anchors now I can go back
to wrote plays I can call legal prefix
get my results and say if there is a
prefix then I want to add to the letters
already on the board otherwise I have
empty space to the left and I want to go
through all the possible prefixes here's
what we do if there is a prefix already
there now we can calculate the start of
our position remember a row play is
going to return the starting location of
the word we can figure that out it's the
I position of the anchor minus the
length of the prefix back let me go and
change this comment here I is not very
descriptive let's just call that so now
we know what the starting location is
for the word when we find any words we
can return that and then we go ahead and
add suffixes with the suffix is some of
the letters are going to come out of the
hand we're adding suffixes to the prefix
that's already there on the board
starting in the start location going
through the row accumulating the results
into the result set and then I needed
this one more argument I actually made a
mistake and left this out the first time
and it didn't work we'll see in a bit
what that's there for now if we have
empty space to the left of the anchor
now we got to go through all the
possible prefixes but we already wrote
that function fine prefixes that's good
looks like we're converging we're not
writing that much new stuff now out of
all the possible prefixes for the hand
we only want to look at the ones that
are less than or equal to the maximum
size if the prefix is too big won't fit
to the empty spot it will run into
another word we don't want to allow that
we can calculate the start position
again and then we do the same thing we
add suffixes what do we add them to well
the prefix that we just found from the
hand and since the prefix came from the
hand the remaining letters left in the
hand we have to subtract out those
prefix letters here we didn't have to
subtract them out because the prefix
letters were already on the board we ran
to the prefix from the start from bro
results are accumulated and we have this
anchored equals false again so now we're
almost there just two things left to do
add suffixes and legal prefix add
suffixes we had before but it's going to
be a little bit more complicated now
because we're dealing with the anchors
and legal prefix is just a matter of
looking to the left and seeing how much
space is there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
