debugging can take a specific test and
use this specific test in order to
automatically simplify a fairly complex
input to an input where every single
character is relevant so far however we
need to set up a specific test function
for every failure is there a way to come
up with generic tests that can be used
for arbitrary situations here again we
have our testing function and we want to
turn this testing function into
something that is more generic for
instance that simply checks whether some
assertion has been raised here I have
converted this testing function into
something way more generic all that's
left in here is the call to the function
I want to test in this case remove HTML
markup if this function raises an
assertion error for instance because the
built-in assertion fails then the test
fails as well if there is no assertion
that fails then we simply return pass so
this test function now can be adapted
again and again for arbitrary functions
as long as they have an assertion or
some other runtime check that makes them
fail here is our remove HTML markup
function from the previous units and it
has an assertion to make sure that the
result no longer contains any HTML
markup and this is precisely what we can
test in here if the assertion fails then
the test will fail and if the assertion
does not fail then the test passes you
remember this notorious input that will
quote HTML tag regular text HTML markup
and quotes which would not work at all
when removing HTML markup indeed this
would make the assertion fail because
the output would still contain HTML
markup now let's go and use Delta
debugging to minimize this input such
that every character in the input is
relevant for producing the error for
remove HTML markup what is the minimal
substring of this string including the
double quotes that triggers the failure
and as a hint it's just to correct as
well over to you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
