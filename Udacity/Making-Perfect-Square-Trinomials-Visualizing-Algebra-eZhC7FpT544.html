complete each of these squares great
thinking if you found these numbers for
the first polynomial we can think about
having one block that's areas x squared
and then six other tiles that have an
area of x we take the 6x and we split
three of the exes over here and three of
the exes over here so we'll have x
squared plus 6 x's and then we'll need
to add 91 pieces to complete our perfect
square so when thinking about completing
the square it's best if this B term is
even this allows us to split up the ex's
so we have half of them here and half of
them here and then we can figure out how
many one pieces we need to add to
complete our perfect square down here
for this first polynomial it turned out
that was nine for the second one we draw
a similar figure as the one before and
we'll find out that will need to add 36
1 tiles to complete the square for this
third polynomial we said we had negative
4x here so we'll have our x squared like
before and then we'll have negative 4
x's so negative 2x and negative 2x which
makes negative 4x so if we were to lay
out these tiles we could see that we
need to add four more one pieces to
complete the square we know that this
diagram also makes sense in terms of
multiplication we know x times x equals
x squared and x times negative 1 equals
negative x we have this negative x for x
once here once here once here and once
here and finally for these 41 pieces we
have a side length of negative 1 here
and a side length of negative 1 here so
negative 1 times negative 1 would equal
a positive one we have this positive 1
for x so we know we have to add 41 tiles
to complete our square</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
