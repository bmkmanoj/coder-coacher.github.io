record category you may have noticed a
method called convert video to gift this
is where the magic happens let's see
here it's using a class called regift
what's that regift was written as a
cocoa pod by matthew palmer and it does
exactly what we need it converts a video
into a gif if you look into the gif
maker objective-c folder you'll see a
folder called third-party code if you
open up that folder you'll see another
folder called regift that's where we've
included the files directly in the
project we've also added these files to
the Swift project template here's
Matthew Palmer's read me for regift on
github and in the QuickStart guide lines
we can see that to initialize an
instance of the regift class we need to
pass in four parameters the video URL
the frame count delay time and loop
count go back into your Swift project
and add frame count delay time and loop
count at the top of the uiviewcontroller
extension file as constants we'll start
with these defaults for now but you can
experiment with different values to suit
your liking next we'll add a method
called convert video to gif which uses
the regift class in this method will
create an instance of the class regift
in the readme we can see that this line
of code initializes an instance of
regift the method that creates the gift
is named appropriately create gift if we
open up the regift Swift file we can see
that create gift returns an nsurl to the
newly created gif so go ahead and create
a variable called gif URL to store the
return value and now that in theory we
have a URL to a gift let's test it out
by displaying it in the gift editor</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
