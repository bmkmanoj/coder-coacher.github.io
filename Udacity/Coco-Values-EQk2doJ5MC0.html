Coco values so Coco stands for
cooperative competitive values Coco
stands for them well the cocoa part of
cocoa value stands for cooperative
competitive okay and this is an idea due
to kalai and kalai cuz you need as many
of those as you can get mm-hmm here is
an example of cocoa values that features
some people that you may recognize so
this is curly and smooth and the bananas
so um carillion smooth would like to get
bananas turns out curly is too short to
get any bananas so true and smooth is
tall enough to get two bananas yeah but
if smooth stood on top of curly's head
then he could actually get four bananas
he could reach these two additional hi
bananas oh so it's like a Tuesday so
let's um let's let's set this up as a as
a matrix game here's a matrix version of
the game so this is suggest to you and
you have two choices you can just reach
for the bananas yourself or you could
stand the top of my head and reach the
other bananas oh so you're my friend in
this sorry curly you could say on the
topic early not you I mean smooth can
stand the top of curly's head okay and
curly has the choice of either allowing
that to happen or not okay I like this
game yeah believe it or not I did not
make this up for the purposes of this
class mm-hm and so we can ask some
questions about this so for example
what's the Nash oh I'm sorry you're
actually asking me that is I guess it's
a rhetorical question except it's not
rhetorical it's just a question uh
pierna if you can find one sure okay
well is there a pier net I mean I just
I've just seen these numbers for the
first time yeah but you shouldn't okay
sure so I can just ask the question all
right so if we do don't boost and reach
would either want to move well it
doesn't really matter if you go from
reach to climb you get the same value
right and it doesn't matter if you wait
no you change sorry you right you smooth
it doesn't matter to smooth it doesn't
matter to smooth once if you're in don't
boost reach and if you're in don't boost
reach it also doesn't wait no I'm sorry
take that back it does matter it does
matter i'm reading the numbers backwards
so the first one is for curly and the
second number is for smooth and put them
in the same order as their where they're
standing know and that makes perfect
sense so if you have 0 comma 2 so then
then if we're stuck on the dump boost
and smooth can move from reach to climb
smooth would not do that because we're
going from 220 uh-huh meanwhile foreign
don't boost reach and curly can change
and curly we go from 0 to 0 and that is
really make a distant different so I
guess don't boost and reach is a Nash
equilibrium so let's see I think there's
probably there's a symmetry thing there
so we know don't boost and climb is not
a Nash equilibrium for the same reason
that 02 is 100 is not because I'd be
going from 0 to 2 if I were smooth so
there's no point worrying about that
what about boost and reach well let's
see that's 0 comma 2 and so curly
doesn't need to move doesn't have an
advantage to moving I'm boost to dump
boost but smooth would want to move
because you'd be going from two to four
so that is not Nash equilibrium okay now
let's look at boosting climb so boostin
climb let's see it sir come before so if
i went from booster dump boost i would
still stay at zero and so that doesn't
help curly any and i wouldn't move from
climb to reach because i'd be going from
four to two and so therefore that is
also an action all right now which Nash
equilibrium do you think would be more
beneficial well for smooth it would
definitely be boosting client yeah what
about for like the Society of these two
people will just add up the total
retrieved bananas so that would be two
verses for ya so in fact again boostin
climb would be on average more
beneficial on average or you know the
sum for the society yeah so my average
is all the same thing right but it sort
of doesn't matter to curly but it would
matter to smooth and it's also the case
that to Nash it doesn't really matter
both of these are Nash equilibrium so
they're both perfectly acceptable from
nash equilibrium sort of point of view
yeah and it's like the example that I
did with chicken where you have two Nash
equilibria and they're both kind of
equally good from Natchez point of view
although in that case they're very
different from the two players point of
view here I suppose either way curly
gets nothing so really it's just about
making smooth happy I like this game so
okay sure fine so that being said can we
see anything about correlated equilibria
I mean I'm sure we can write we can you
know any mixed Nash equilibria zecora
equilibria but also but I think this is
little different right here right
because no matter what happens curly
gets zero so that means that curly
anything's going to be equally okay too
curly right so clearly not really going
to participate in the equilibrium pneus
or lack thereof right so really this is
all about getting to boosting and
climbing yea though though I think you
said that any convex combination of a
Nash is a correlated equilibrium that's
right so it should be everything like 02
02 10 to 20 to 30 to 40 to 50 dicks all
the way up 20 or 30 for we know that all
those have to be Nash values of some
sorry I correlated there had to be a
value of some correlated equilibrium
that is like 0 comma 3 for temple</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
