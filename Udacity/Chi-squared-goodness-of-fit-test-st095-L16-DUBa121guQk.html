example in this case remember our null
hypothesis would be based on the
population so knowing which null
hypothesis to use it can be tricky
you'll continue to keep building up an
intuitive sense of what the null
hypothesis should be depending on the
situation and the question you're asking
in our example we now know what kind of
success to expect based on the null
hypothesis and we also know what kind of
success the guide company observed last
year and now we need to test how well
these obtained sample frequencies or
proportions fit the population
proportions or are expected frequencies
this is called the chi-squared goodness
of fit test you might be wondering about
the alternative hypothesis the
alternative hypothesis is basically that
the null hypothesis is not true in this
type of test we really only need to use
numbers for the null hypothesis as usual
with the tests you've learned about
there's a test statistic and it's
symbolized by chi-squared before we get
into the details of this test statistic
think about it yourself how would you
statistically show that the observed
frequency is greater or less than the
expected frequency would you subtract
one from the other would you add things
multiply or divide things I'm being very
vague but before you move on to the next
video maybe pause and think about how
you would construct a statistic such
that if the observed frequencies are
very different from the expected
frequencies we'd get one number that's
bigger than if the observed and expected
frequencies were similar</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
