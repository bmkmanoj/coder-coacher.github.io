customer development that's makes
startups very different from large
companies is that customer development
is done by the founders well why the
founders it turns out that there's a
couple of interesting things and this is
about human nature there's no technology
involved in a traditional startup in the
old days you would hire a VP of Sales
who would go out because you were smart
this was your idea and you'd say go go
try to sell this go talk to customers
I'll just hire somebody to do this but
remember a hire so an employee doesn't
have the vision they're just executing
what you told them and guess what
happens if they go out and talk to
people who say this is the worst idea we
ever heard her know we won't buy it what
happens is they'll come back and tell
you in the first time they do this so
you'll say well you're just not
describing it right and you send them
back out for another couple days or
weeks or months and they'll come back
again and if you're like any passionate
founder you'll go I hire the wrong
executive you're fired now just imagine
we run the exercise this time not with a
proxy a head of sales or marketing but
we force you to get out you the founder
to start talking to customers and if you
got that same exact feedback it might
take you three customers or five four
thirty but eventually smoke will start
coming out of your ears because
cognitive dissonance is is now coming
into effect is that you might realize
that your story or vision isn't right
but unlike a proxy a VP of Sales or
marketing you have the power to change
the company strategy you have the power
to change the entire value proposition
to say well what if we had these
features and customers might say man and
that's still not but then if you said
well what if we had this they might say
oh if you could do that you could have
my check right now now if you're smart
founder you'd say oh let me get right
back to you because what you'll do is
you'll go test that new feature with
five or ten other customers and all of a
sudden you realize that you have the
wrong feature set and just by adding the
small little change you can now actually
get a whole series of paying customers
only founders could do that and what we
did in the past is we would wait to
first customership
we'd wait till sales didn't match the
revenue plan
and we naturally make these changes by
firing executives instead of actually
having the founders engaged in day one
so it's the founder who could change the
product make pivots and hear customer
feedback firsthand and that's the idea
of getting the founder outside the
building</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
