show you an interesting example of what
would be an ideal focal length for
taking images of portraits again I have
my scene I have my camera I can use it
85 millimeter lens and get the whole
field of view that I want in this case
I'm using a simple example a bust of
Abraham Lincoln I'm using this 85
millimeter lens and this is what the
shot I get I move closer this is a 50
millimeter lens now looking at the same
subject here is the output it does get
darker a little bit for variety of
reasons we'll be looking at that in more
detail when we talk about the exposure
triangle but you notice that there is a
little bit of a difference between these
two images right if I was to just
basically say this lips here seemed to
be now much more smaller than this one
but actually let's go and further and
see if we can move further and see what
happens moving the camera further in
since I want the same field of view I
would course and of course I have the
same sensors the same camera I would
have to change the focal length this is
what telephoto lenses are usually very
good at and of course now you see a 20
millimeter lens and this is the image we
get if you notice this face now has a
little bit more Distortion it feels more
curved and much more kind of all things
the dimension seem to be had and the
dimensions have shrunk a little bit the
nose seems a little bit more a kind of
projected outwards as opposed to in this
case the face looks much more face like
so here there is a lot more Distortion
now of course most photography is you
know again what you want to do with it
but just by changing these types of
things or parameters on your camera you
can change the look and feel of an image
so traditionally most portrait lenses
that people use are 75 millimetres to
135 i actually prefer to use an 85
millimeter this is one of my favorite
lenses because it actually gives you
portrait and of course there are other
things that are going on that we will
also look at is you know issues around a
little bit of more blurring in the
background which is less kind of visible
in these ones but a much nicer and these
kind of an image so in the next lecture
when we look at the exposure trying
we'll be looking at the relationship of
again details that allow us to kind of
also get more information the back and
the front of an image</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
