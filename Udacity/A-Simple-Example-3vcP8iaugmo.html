very simple example and here it is so
imagine you've got a robot that just has
two things okay it is a map of a hallway
okay so here you're seeing a hallway and
by the way this little blue dot here
this is the robot the robot doesn't
actually know where it is we know where
it is because we're really really smart
okay or we work for the NSA I hope that
didn't cost me my grant anyway so the
robot knows this this map and it knows
that essentially where the walls are and
where the doors are and we'll assume
that the doors are open right the other
thing that the robot has is it just has
a detector a sensor really dumb that
just looks out to the side you can even
think of it as just got a stick and it
pokes it and it says do I hit something
or don't I and by the way it's not very
accurate so he sticks it out there and
sometimes he sticks it this way and
sometimes state so it's approximately
that direction it just says did I hit
something or not now you might think
that would be incredibly dumb robot and
you might be right except here's a
picture of a robot I don't insult my ass
are I friends because this robot
actually got pretty smart but this is
the robot originally flaky here and
flaky head down below on the bottom
these little ultrasonic sensors that
would send out a chirp and it would
respond back did I hit anything or how
far away was the thing that I hit so
humor me that this is just a robot that
basically detects just a hole or just a
not a hole that's the only thing that it
knows and because it's not perfect in
setting out its its signal right just
because it says the sensor says hole
doesn't mean it actually was a hole all
right and just because it says wall
doesn't mean to actually was a wall okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
