to display text you can also print out
the result of a calculation for example
like this statement here system dot out
dot print line 2 + 3 notice that I
didn't put any quotation marks around
this here because we don't want to
display it as text we actually want the
result of this mathematical calculation
so when we run this Java program here
with those two statements the output we
get is HelloWorld just exactly as we
typed it in here but then the second
line is just 5 which is the result of 2
+ 3 notice how each one was printed in a
separate line in print line command and
how the first one was displayed exactly
as we typed it in while the second one
was the result of a calculation
computers can do a lot more than just
display a message on the screen
yep they can make decisions and perform
calculations based on the information
that we give them in fact let me show
you what a computer can do that us
humans are terrible at say sound you
want to play a game sure what game it's
a memory game you might need to use
these so imagine that there's this bus
that starts off with no passengers on
board and then later on three passengers
hop on and two passengers hop off later
on one more passenger hops on and no one
hops off later on another passenger hops
on and another passenger hops off my
question is how many stops did the bus
make oh no I wasn't keeping track of
that I know but you did a really good
job keeping track of the passengers on
the bus it's also interesting that you
only needed one box to do that yeah
that's because all I need to keep track
of is just this one single number of
passengers on board I didn't really need
to remember every single number you said
true and that's exactly what a computer
would have done as well let me show you
how</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
