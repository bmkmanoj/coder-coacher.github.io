are we going to do this because this
seems extremely difficult to show so we
would have to find a problem for which
we can prove that any other problem in
NP can be reduced to it luckily for us
or actually more luckily for me this
work has already been done about 40
years ago by showing a problem called
boolean satisfiability or Sat for short
to be np-complete and this result is one
of the most famous results in
theoretical computer science which is
why we're going to investigate it in
detail and also investigate the proof
together the result is called the
cook-levin theorem this theorem is named
after Stephen cook and Leonid Levin who
discovered it independently of each
other in the 1970s and by showing that
they provided exactly this and
p-complete seed problem namely sat which
could then be used to show that a number
of other problems are np-complete as
well and I'm then going to show you how
cook and Levin proved that Sad is
np-complete and once we have shown that
sad SMP complete we can go back to the
problems of Alice Bob and Carol and see
if those problems are np-complete before
we go deeper into the set problem and
proving the cook-levin theorem here's
one more quiz to make sure that you
understand where we are going with this
so once we have shown that the Sat
problem is np-complete how would we then
show or at least try to show that the
vertex cover problem independent set and
clique are np-complete would we have to
show that any input for sat and I'll
soon tell you what that input exactly is
can be transformed into an input for one
of these problems and by these problems
I mean vertex cover independent set or
clique or would we have to show that one
of the three problems up here can be
expressed as an input to Sat or would we
have to show that all three problems can
be expressed as an input to set so
please check all of these which are
correct</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
