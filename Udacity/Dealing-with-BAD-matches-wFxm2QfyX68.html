is not a trivial all the time we are
dealing with feature detection which
does have sometimes problems and
sometimes of course you know why there
are problems with feature matching let's
look at two images I'm going to zoom in
again just to kind of show you more
details so this is my right image and my
left image now what I can start doing is
of course finding features so I found
one here and of course this also here
and I can match it I can keep doing this
for a variety of features another one
here and of course if you look at it
decent feature detection would do fine
for some of these types of things
another feature match between these two
points also works and I'm basically what
I'm doing is I'm just kind of running a
feature matching algorithm finding
features and seeing if they match
between two images if you notice each
one of them right now looks pretty good
and the transformation looks to be
correct all of them seem to be moving
approximately by the same amount
remember this our cameras moving these
are images moving because we've kept the
point the same so we expect these row
these arrows that kind of show the
distance between these features to be
the same right and of course same thing
is true for this one but if we keep
doing this you will find and of course
there will be instances there will be
features like this matches to this now
this looks like a bad match to anyone
especially if you consider the fact that
the all of the other ones were you know
the distance between them with this much
another bad match here so we want to be
able to discount these matches and here
can you can see this is a bad match so
we want to be able to kind of look for
good matches refer to them as in liars
and ignore the bad matches refer to as
outliers so this can be done by a
process called ransack or random sample
consensus which basically means randomly
we're going to sample things but at the
same time we're going to see which one
of them are actually creating a
consensus which one of them are more pop
just looking at this you can see that
the yellow ones are more popular than
more of them they will actually be the
in liars and they will actually kind of
outward our popularized the red ones
which are outliers so we want to build
consensus but we want to do this
randomly not to have a bias so in
essence what it means is start with one
match and then find all of the other
ones that match it these are the in
liars then find the average translation
vector of these and Liars which in this
case would be this line here notice this
line is shorter much more similar to all
of the yellow ones not anywhere close to
the red one and basically now this gives
me an algorithm to be able to kind of
compute which matches on a liar let's
look at that algorithm for a ransack
