words the place where you've seen it the
most so far has been in language but
we're also going to see how to use it to
make procedures and you'll also see how
to use it in later classes how to define
data structures there are lots and lots
of different things in computing that
are defined recursively and a recursive
definition has two parts it has the base
case in our example with the word that
was the second rule and the base case we
can think of it as a starting point and
the important thing about the base case
is it's not defined in terms of itself
it has to be something where we already
know how to define it so for programs
it's usually going to be the smallest
input or one of the simplest inputs
something where we already know the
answer we don't have to do any
computation to figure it out the second
part is the recursive case and that is
defined in terms of itself but it
shouldn't be defined in terms of itself
exactly it should be defined in terms of
some sort of smaller version of itself
we need to make progress to eventually
get to the base case we'll see what that
means in programs soon first we're going
to try one other example not in terms of
a program just to get a better sense for
how things can be defined recursively</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
