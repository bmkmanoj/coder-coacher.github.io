classes we are going to build up on the
top right hand corner and what I've done
thus far is created a new Python file
and I called it inheritance pie now
based on our design I'm going to go
ahead and create a class called held
there the next thing to do is to
initialize the variables of class parent
variables like last name and eye color
so to do that I will define this class's
init method or constructor the first
argument for this function we know is
self and the two instance variables for
class parent we know are self dot last
name and self dot eye color now
the init function we know will receive a
couple of values as arguments so let me
add them here and we will use these two
arguments to initialize our instance
variables let me do that next all right
you may notice that this piece of code
is pretty similar to the code for class
movie that we have written previously by
the way one new thing I will do here is
add a quick print statement inside the
init method it will print out parent
constructor called so this print
statement will explicitly tell us each
time the init method or the constructor
of class parent is called all right to
make sure that this code that we've
written thus far actually works let's go
ahead and use this class I will define
an instance of class parent and call it
Billy Cyrus and we'll provide the two
arguments that are necessary the first
of which is last name and that happens
to be Cyrus and the next one is eye
color which is let's say blue now a
quick word of caution ordinarily I would
have kept these two things the
definition of the class parent and
creating it's instances I would have
kept them in separate Python files but
I've kept them both here in the same
file for ease of demonstration okay so
to demonstrate that the instance
actually works I will print out its last
name
let me save and then run this file and
there's my output it says the parent
constructor was called which seems
appropriate because we created an
instance called Billy Cyrus and as soon
as we did that the class parents init
method got scald which had a print
statement inside it and then we printed
out Billy Cyrus's last name which it
printed out correctly okay so far so
good
now you'll notice that there really
isn't anything new that we have done
here thus far the new thing that we are
going to try is called inheritance which
will happen when we create the class
called child let's do that next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
