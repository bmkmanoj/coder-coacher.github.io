have some instructions fetch this is the
very first one that we will be trying to
issue this is our reservation stations
our register file with the values the
right that says where the values are
currently and it's pointing to the
register file for now the Rob that is
empty for now this is a little table
that we will be writing what happens in
which cycle and then this is kind of the
legend for our reservation stations and
Rob's because we need to know which
field to put which value in so in cycle
one what's going to happen is we are
going to try to issue this first
instruction to do that we need an
available reservation station and an
available Rob entry we have both so we
are ready to go it's a divide and we're
going to write the divides and of
operation here it's writing to our two
so we're going to note that in the
destination register over here we're
going to write the destination tag in
the reservation station that's going to
be Rob one now remember that the value
we broadcast the result with basically
the tag that everybody's trying to
compare is now going to be the Rob entry
number not the reservation station
number that's what allows us to free
reservation stations very quickly the r3
and r4 are going to be locked up here we
will find that it's forty five and five
and write it here and then we are going
to rename our two so that it points to
Rob one from now on and then because we
said that we will be able to dispatch in
the very same cycle and begin execution
in the next cycle we have issued this
instruction in cycle one it's going to
begin executing in cycle two because
both of its operands have values ready
to go now in cycle two this instruction
begins executing so the reservation
station becomes free before I free the
reservation station I'm going to note
that this instruction is dividing forty
five and five so the result that is
going to eventually end up in the Rob
it's going to be nine forty five over
five this instruction is not done so
technically this value lands here only
when it's done but I'm going to know
this is what's going to happen because I
want to know what that value will be and
with that this reservation station
becomes free so now it's going to happen
this is a divide it's going to take 40
cycles to do things so in cycle 42 which
is the 41st cycles since we begin
executing we
try to write its result that's going to
be a long time in the future meanwhile
in cycle 2 we're going to try to do the
rest of the things can we dispatch
something else
well nothing to dispatch can we issue
something well the multiplication has a
reservation station and Robin tree ready
to be obtained so we can do that it's a
mouth of our one the tag for it is not
going to be robbed to r5 and r6 are 3 &amp;amp;
4 so we have the values we don't have to
wait for anything and r1 is a result now
we need to remember that r1 from now on
is mapped to rob to basically if anybody
from known wants to use r1 it really
needs to wait for the result of
instruction in Rob tool so this
instruction has issued in cycle 2 it's
gone a dispatch also in cycle 2 because
it's ready to go so in cycle 3 it's
going to begin executing and with that
we have moved to cycle 3</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
