physical and web/mobile channels first
come into play because the MVP for a
physical channel that is something you
sell directly through stores and with
the direct sales force it's very
different than something that you might
be building for the web or even more so
for a mobile channel so in a physical
channel what you really want to have is
something that customers can touch and
feel because you're gonna be out talking
to them and well you could certainly go
out with a PowerPoint deck with a photo
of what the product is going to look
like etc my advice always is invest a
day or two in building something even if
it's out of styrofoam and cardboard or
if it's something as small as a chip a
microphone a graph or a micro photograph
of a proposed die layout that is almost
for any physical product you should
probably be going out and trying to get
some reaction based on something that
people could see in touch and in doing
that you're going to test your
understanding of the problem test your
understanding of the solution and when
you do that it's going to prove that it
solves the core problem for the
customers and you're going to learn what
the minimum set of features are from the
early evangelists in a physical channel
this requires lots of interviews demos
and prototypes and lots of eyeball
contact</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
