at this point we've done an awful lot
yeah
how many isn't about to start the 15th
oh my god but I wouldn't say that
there's 15 totally separate topics I'd
say there's maybe more like four okay
main topics yeah what I think the first
one is the data set and the question if
you want to use machine learning can you
define a question and find the data that
could help you answer it and I guess
it's the second one is feature selection
finding the right two feature spaces for
your machine learning either them to
apply once you have the features do you
have an algorithm that you can use and
the parameter Tunes you want for that
algorithm and finally the fourth step is
validation make sure what you've got the
safety trustworthy and of course these
steps you won't just hit each of them
once but you'll cycle through them
repeatedly as you start to figure out a
little bit more about each individual
question you learn more and you do it a
little bit better so in this last and
final unit in this last and final unit
you put the big picture together you're
going to go up to a high altitude and
learn the big picture composition of
machine learning so you can actually
apply these techniques in practice so
let's head up to that higher level</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
