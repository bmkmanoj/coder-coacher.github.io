coefficient which is just about to learn
about is a value between minus 1 and 1
tells us how related or correlated two
variables are in both 1 and minus 1
stand for perfectly linear data in the
case of plus 1 we know that the best
line increases in x and y simultaneously
whereas for minus 1 we have the inverse
effect so let's compute our my favorite
way to compute it is very similar to the
very computed B in linear regression it
looks at the sum of all data points and
takes the product of X I minus the mean
X and multiplies for each data point is
with y I minus the mean of Y and then we
have to normalize this could be any
value it isn't between plus minus 1 if
we normalize by by a square root of x
minus X prime X minus the mean of X
square sum of all eyez times the same
expression for y now this looks a little
bit wild this is probably the worst
formula you've encountered in this class
in terms of complexity but once you dive
in you realize is really related to a
lot of stuff you've seen before such as
variances and similar this is the
quintessential term that occurs in the
variance calculation of X all that's
missing is the normalizer same over here
this is the variance of Y missing is the
normalizer we take the product of the
variance of X and the variance of Y
modally the normalizes and we get
something quadratic even in variant
space this over here is kind of a mixed
variance this is often called the Co
variance but notice that there's also a
normalized missing over here in fact the
missing normalizes on top and bottom of
this bar cancel each other out hence I
just omitted them but this one is just
like the variance calculation but it
mixes X's and Y's whereas these are X
squares and Y squares this is called
often Co variance if you'd normalized
because it is the variance calculation
over two core occurring variables these
are the variances so what this view
tells you is kind of the ratio how much
these two things co-evolved how much the
errors correspond
which is normalized by the magnitudes of
errors individually and whether the
ratio becomes one we have a perfect
correlation when the ratio becomes zero
then the numerator is zero which means
our errors cancel each other out there
is very different for X and for y under
any linear model so this complicated
formula is what's called the correlation
coefficient R so let's try this out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
