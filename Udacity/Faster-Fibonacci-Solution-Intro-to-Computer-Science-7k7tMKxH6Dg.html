iteratively we're gonna avoid all the
redundant computation by keeping track
as we go and we're gonna have two
variables and I'm gonna do this in a
slightly strange way and the reason for
this will become clear soon I want to
make it so we can get the right answer
when n is zero and when it is one
without having special cases so instead
of keeping track of the previous two I'm
gonna keep track of the current one and
the imaginary one that's going to be
after that and we know that the first
two Fibonacci numbers are zero and one
so we'll use current is zero and the
next one will call after is one so
that's the one after the one that we're
currently doing and now we have a loop
so we're gonna go from I in the range
from zero to n so we're looking for
Fibonacci number n that means we want to
start at zero the current value is the
value for Fibonacci zero and after is
the value for Fibonacci one and as we go
through the loop we'll keep updating
those and we want to update them by
following the recursive rule and so that
means that the new value of current is
the current value of after and the new
value of after is the sum of those two
is current plus after we can do that
with a multiple assignment that'll save
us from needing a temporary variable we
can assign current and after to their
new values the new value of current is
the current value of after and the new
value of after is current plus after so
this is a place where multiple
assignment comes in handy if we didn't
use a multiple assignment we'd have to
use a temporary value to keep track of
one of these while we do the assignments
but with multiple assignment we get both
of these values first and then we assign
them to the two variables on the left
side so that's all we need and then
after the loop we should return the
value of current which is the current
Fibonacci number if we're looking for
Fibonacci n so let's try that so we
should be able to see Fibonacci 0 and
the result should be 0 and that's what
we get and because that's the value of
current when the range is from 0 to 0 we
don't go through the loop at all so we
get the value 1 let's check through the
nachi 1
and we run this we get the value one
which is also what we expect and we got
that because we went through the loop
once assigning the value of after which
started as one two current and that's
what we returned as the value of current
and we can keep going we'll try
Fibonacci two and that's also one as we
expect and Fibonacci three should be one
plus one gets us two and so forth okay
so this looks like it's working we've
tried a few simple ones let's try
Fibonacci 33 so we estimated in the
earlier equisetum pute Fibonacci 36 we
even need Fibonacci 33 calls using the
previous recursive definition so why did
it take so long for that code to run so
what's the value of Fibonacci 33 and
that's what it is it's three and a half
million calls and so even with a
processor that's doing a billion
instructions a second doing three and a
half million recursive calls takes quite
a while each time through the call is
many more than just one structure and
it's many thousands of instructions so
this starts to take enough time that we
didn't see the result and it wasn't only
those Fibonacci 33 calls to Fibonacci 2
we had all the other things that we had
to do to get Fibonacci 36 but let's see
that now we have our faster iterative
definition of Fibonacci that isn't doing
all that duplicate work that we can
compute Fibonacci 36 and so that gives
us this value so indicating that there
would be about 15 million rabbits after
three years using Fibonacci's model
let's try what we'd have after five
years passing in 60 months and we get
this starting to be a quite a huge
number to try to relate to this let's
look at how long it would take for the
mass of all the rabbits that are born to
exceed the mass of the earth so the mass
of the earth is five point nine seven to
two times ten to the twenty four and
that's in kilograms
and I'm using the x times notation this
gives us a power so this is 10 to the
power 24 so that's one way to write 5.9
times 10 to the 24 kilograms just to
demonstrate the power notation this is 2
to the power 10 so we'll see the result
is a thousand 24 that's what we get by
multiplying 2 times 2 times 2 times 2 10
times here we're multiplying 10 by
itself 24 times and that's a good
estimate for the mass of the earth so
now to find out how many months it takes
before the mass of the rabbits exceeds
the mass of the earth we're going to
have a for loop we're gonna loop from
Fibonacci numbers until we get to a
number that exceeds the mass of the
earth we also need to decide what a mass
of a rabbit is and I'm going to assume
that a rabbit weighs about 2 kilograms
and that's a pretty good guess for how
heavy a rabbit is that's assuming of
course a well-fed rabbit like we have
today
not if the rabbits spread as fast as
Fibonacci's model would suggest that
they do so we'll write a loop to see
when the mass of the rabbits exceeds the
mass of the earth
we'll start with in equals 1 and we're
going to keep going until Fibonacci n
exceeds the mass of the earth so we'll
go while Fibonacci n times the mass of
the rabbit so Fibonacci n gives us the
number of rabbits in month n times the
mass of the rabbit and as long as that
is less than the mass of the earth the
earth is still safe for Humanity or at
least there's some space left for humans
and every time through the loop will
increase n by 1 and at the end of the
loop will print out the value of n we'll
see where we got and let's also print
out the value of Fibonacci n to see how
big the Fibonacci number of that hen is
so we'll keep going through the loop as
long as the Fibonacci of n times the
mass of the rabbit is less than the mass
of the earth and once we stop the loop
that means we've exceeded the mass of
the earth and we'll see what the result
is so let's try running that and we get
this result
the value of n is 119 so it would only
take 119 months or just less than 10
years until the mass of the rabbits
exceeds the mass of the earth and this
is the number of rabbits we would have
then a pretty big number you should be
very afraid
of all these rabbits the good news is
that Fibonacci's model is not actually
correct that this was an mathematical
abstraction for rabbit reproduction real
rabbits actually die off after some
point and if there are too many rabbits
they don't have enough food so they
don't keep growing like the Fibonacci
numbers and take over the entire planet
so we should be very afraid
if Fibonacci's model is correct it would
only take 10 years for the rabbits to
take over the entire planet and weigh
more than the earth does itself the good
news is is not a very accurate model of
how rabbits reproduce that they don't
live forever and once there are too many
rabbits they start to run out of food so
they stop reproducing and stop surviving</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
