approximation algorithms well it shows
that even though a problem can be very
hard initially once you notice small
parts of the solution it can become
rather easy to obtain a complete
solution and so the deep result that
underlies this statement here basically
works the same way it says that if you
know a small part of the solution of
clique and independent set then you can
use this to construct an optimal
solution the real proof of this is much
more complex but that is the basic idea
having a constant factor approximation
algorithm four clique or independent set
would reveal so much information about a
perfect solution that you could
construct a polynomial time algorithm
from this and actually there's a similar
result for vertex cover surprisingly but
Alice doesn't need to worry that much so
for vertex cover there is no constant
factor approximation that is better than
1.36 unless P equals NP and actually
many people believe that this number you
should be higher but this is the highest
number that has been proven so far</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
