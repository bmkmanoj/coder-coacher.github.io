selling is knowing who you selling to
and what they care about so
understanding who's standing in front of
you when its investor and employee or
customer partner and what they truly
care about really dictates the tone or
what you're selling and how you sell it
for that you need to be able to know
everything and anything about your
business so you can tune your pitch to
whoever standing across from you so if
in a networking event it's an investor
and you pick it up very quickly you're
gonna have a very specific pitch that is
different then if across from you is a
potential new high oh so knowing who
that person is it's probably the most
important and first step of developing
your pitching skills and then obviously
the thing that will get you good at it
is just again practicing the more you
practice the belly the better you'll be
good at it and you can probably measure
it because your pictures will become
significantly shorter it's really easy
to sell something using lots of
sentences and a many minutes it's really
hard to do so with a few words and a few
seconds and the more you practice the
better you'll become at selling</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
