undecidable we should first start out
with a program for which we want to
decide the halting problem and that
should be P so we start out with this
step here then we add a second program
and that program is called P Prime and
it goes into an infinite loop so no
matter what input this program is just
programmed to always go into an infinite
loop once we have those two programs P
and P prime we run them through the
algorithm that decides the equivalence
and what that will do is it will
basically ask does the program P for
which we want to decide the halting
problem do the same thing as a program
that always goes into an infinite loop
and then of course that means if the two
programs are indeed equivalent then P
will also go into an infinite loop
because all that P prime is doing is it
always goes into an infinite loop and we
don't even need the other two building
blocks because we have now shown that
you can use equivalents to solve the
halting problem you just compare any
program for which you want to decide the
halting problem to a program that always
goes into an infinite loop and if they
do the same thing then they are
equivalent so you know that P will not
halt and if they are not equivalent well
then p halts now this was certainly one
of the tougher quizzes in this course so
congratulations for figuring it out but
of course I also trust that by now you
have learned the ropes of theoretical
computer science yurov art here is that
I will give you a third proof of
undecidability for free</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
