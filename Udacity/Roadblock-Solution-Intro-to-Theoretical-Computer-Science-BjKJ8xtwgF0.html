can always win this game here that I
gave you and one strategy for player one
to do this for example is to move this
piece over here to here now it's players
to turn and player 1 is now threatening
to win in the next move by moving this
piece here to this piece here now player
2 could try and block this vertex here
but player 2 can only do this with this
piece here if player 2 were to move his
or her piece over here then player 1 in
the next move could however move this
piece here to that vertex so no matter
what player 2 does player 1 will win in
the next move by either moving this
piece here to that vertex or being able
to move this piece here to that vertex
player 2 could also use this piece here
to block this vertex down here but that
would still keep this one here free and
player 2 also cannot reach any of the
vertices that would let player to win so
for this initial configuration here
player 1 can always force a win now if
you figured out that quiz yourself you
should be very very proud of yourself
asking this question can player 1 force
a win for a given instance of roadblock
on a graph with n vertices is provably
harder than any problem in NP which
means that this problem requires
exponential time to solve even if P were
equal to NP so even if you show this or
had a non-deterministic Ram available to
solve this problem you would still
require exponential time and that is why
roadblock is one example for a game or
asking a question about a game that is
harder to solve than anything in NP</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
