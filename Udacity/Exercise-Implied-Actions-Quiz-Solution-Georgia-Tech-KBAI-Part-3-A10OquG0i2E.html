sentence as bill propelled a bullet into
bob i looked at the verb shot and
decided what that really means is
pulling the trigger on a gun which
results in a bullet being propelled at
high velocity out of the guns barrel so
it's fair to say that shot becomes
propelled a bullet given that i now have
propelled as my primitive i have the
same rule that says an animate agent
that immediately precedes the verb
becomes the agent in the frame so bill
is now my agent I have my rule that says
an inanimate object that immediately
follows the verb becomes the object so
bullet is now my object even the bullet
wasn't in the original sentence it's by
rephrasing it that I can pull that
object out and I can use the constraints
of into to determine that the
destination of the bullet is inside Bob
that's good David but no descendants
could have another interpretation also
imagine that bill had a camera and we'll
was simply taking pictures of Bob that's
true Ashok and I bet if we had use bill
takes a picture of Bob as the meaning of
shoot earlier in this lesson that's
probably what I would have thought at
first if I wanted to then put bill shot
Bob in terms of taking a picture into
this form I'd first rewrite it as bill
took a picture of Bob that's really
interesting David because notice if you
say bill took a picture of Bob it's not
clear into what primitive action with
this took map into perhaps we can
discuss this more on the forum there's
one more thing to notice here like david
says i can have multiple interpretations
of build short bob this sentence doesn't
help me resolve between those
interpretations perhaps it is something
coming before this sentence in this
story is only coming after that there
will help me disambiguate from the
sentence itself we can simply construct
two particular interpretations</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
