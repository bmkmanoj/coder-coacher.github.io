if you did excellent work this is a
really tough problem even if you didn't
get this answer if you got part of the
solution right or some of the variables
right great work I'm going to first
solve this problem using substitution so
if you chose this method stay with me if
you try to elimination fast forward
until you see the word elimination here
also at any point if you find a
correction to your work pause the video
and then try and keep solving finding
the types of mistakes we make is really
important so that we can improve on our
math skills try and think about the
mistake you made and where you went
wrong thinking about that mistake can
prevent you from making it in the future
I think it's easiest to solve for x
using this equation I just need to add
why to both sides so i have x equals 3
plus y and remember i could also write
this as y plus 3 editions commutative
now that I've solved for X I can replace
this X with the equivalent expression 3
plus y so I have 3 times 3 plus y plus
2y equals 12 I distribute the positive 3
to get 9 plus 3y plus 2y equals 12 3y +
2 y make positive 5y and then I just
carry down the terms so 9 plus 5y equals
12 i can subtract 9 from both sides so
5y is equal to 3 and finally i divide
both sides by 5 so y equals three fifths
now i can substitute the value of y
which is three fifths into the second
equation i chose a second equation
because these coefficients were one it
looked a little bit more simple than the
first equation so i plug in the value of
three-fifths or Y then i need to add
three fifths to both sides to isolate x
so x is equal to three plus three fifths
we know we can write this as a mixed
number the mixed number is three and
three fifths we have the whole number
and then the fraction converting this to
an improper fraction we would have 18
fists this is some amazing math work for
substitution if we use elimination i can
multiply the second equation by a
positive 2 this will allow me to
eliminate the Y variable you might have
chosen to multiply this equation by
negative 3 that would have let you
eliminate the X variable that's okay
that could work to 2 times X is 2 x 2 x
negative Y is negative 2y + 2 times 3 is
6 so I get 5x is equal to 18 and the
eliminate to solve for x we divide both
sides by 5 so one x is equal to 18
fifths we know the whys should be three
fifths so let's see if we can find it
using our x value i'm going to use the
second equation to find the value of y i
take 18 fifths and plug it in for X so I
have 18 fifth minus y equals 3 well I
know 18 fifths is really three and three
fifths this is the mixed number that
represents or is equal to this improper
fraction five goes into 18 three times
and I have a remainder of 3 or three
fifths so I have to take away some
number from three and three fifths to
get three well this number has to be
three fifths if I just think about it I
know why needs to be three fifths
there's our solution</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
