tour works so it's called Onion Routing
is what I think the example we had was
sort of doing something like that it
uses Onion Routing so to start you know
the client we are talking about gets
uses a directive service to get a set of
four nodes these nodes would then help
us out the message from Alice to Bob's
website you sort of pick a random set
and order it so the mass is going to go
from one to the next in the order that
we come up with alice is going to
prepare her message and creates these
onion layers so in the end it's going to
go to Bob's website but you know then we
know it's going to be sent to Bob's
website by the last node and its
predecessor is going to send it to that
and things like that so the the onion
layers that you're talking about
essentially when you peel one you know
where it goes next ok but that's all you
don't see any further down through the
layers beyond that so we peel one layer
we know who to send it to next in this
order that we're talking about then that
node is going to feel another layer and
set it to its successor and and we're
going to continue like that and it's you
know feeling of the layers actually is
done through encryption using keys you
encrypt it with someone's public key so
they can only they can decrypt it
because they have the corresponding
private key and and and that's how this
thing works so that's an honest
communication well you can Alice doesn't
have to say that it's Alice if Bob's
website demand some sort of identity for
her you can create sort of fictional or
pseudo identities you can have multiple
one of those so you know somebody you
switch your identity they can't say that
it's alice is doing a B and C if you
switched after a then you know whoever
is tracking would think B it's being
done by somebody other than whoever had
done a so pseudo anonymity is another
way by which we tried to sort of defeat
the tracking and making the kind of
inferences that we're talking about and
of course we we talked about aggregation
and privacy enhancing transformations
like anonymization
data diversity in data so someone is not
able to inference back to you that this
must be some information about you and
things like that so so there variety of
these technologies and techniques that
one can use to improve privacy too if
not defeat at least reduce the
effectiveness of tracking and that
happens and collection of information
that can be tied to particular identity
we can this technology sort of help is
disrupt that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
