these update requests feels a little
like you're sending messages off to the
firebase void unsure whether they
complete or are received be there hello
are you there
Lila are you there
okay well at least you're still
connected let's talk about completion
callbacks one aspect of writing data we
haven't discussed is the completion
callback completion callbacks are useful
if you want to explicitly return the
status of a completed write operation
for example if you use a completion
callback when a write is successful or
fails an object will be returned
describing the success or in the event
of an error failure of that write for
example if you use a completion callback
when a write is successful or fails an
object will be returned describing the
success or in the event of an error
failure of that write we aren't using
completion callbacks in shopping lists
plus plus however there are a few
situations where using completion
callbacks would be useful a basic use
would be to provide detailed debugging
information in the dev and test phase
for example to provide an explicit way
to verify that data is being saved
another use would be to use a completion
callback to fire when a value is
returned that is outside of a threshold
as a comparison have you ever seen the
all changes safe to drive message in
Google Docs it doesn't hurt to provide
users with a little assurance that their
data has been saved to the cloud
similarly sometimes chat programs will
tell you when the message has been sent
to the other user</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
