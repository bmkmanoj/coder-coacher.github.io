Facebook with Dean Morin Solomon and
spoke with many data scientists I
learned a lot about EDA and I'm excited
to share their stories with you
throughout the course first you'll hear
from a talk about what she finds most
interesting about being a data scientist
so what I really like is be able to go
from real Road data we have like
billions and trillions of rows of data
you don't know what's interesting it's
like gigantic thing and you need to just
investigate and have some ideas on what
might be interesting
and then just try investigating it like
in different ways sometimes you use
charts sometimes you use maps and
sometimes you come across something
that's interesting and that you want to
dig a little bit more into and then
eventually once we have figured out
something interesting that we've
developed the corresponding algorithms
then the goal is to have an impact on
either understanding the world or
changing the facebook product and being
able to go from we have all these data
we don't know what to do with it so like
we're going to make a significant impact
on like understanding mobility or
improving facebook that's like a really
awesome flow a word</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
