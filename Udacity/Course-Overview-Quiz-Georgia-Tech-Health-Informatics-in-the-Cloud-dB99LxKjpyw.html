they correspond with the ten chapters in
the text we've split lesson five into
two sections because of its length while
the material is not generally
technically difficult there is a lot of
it more in fact than can be covered in
the lectures so reading the text and the
other suggested materials is key lessons
1 &amp;amp; 2 provide background on us
healthcare delivery and the role the
federal government is playing to foster
adoption of information technology
lessons 3 through 5 cover the core
technologies that are all contemporary
health informatics systems and tools
rest on lesson 6 through 8 show how
health informatics is being used in real
world applications from electronic
records for providers and patients to
managing the health of large populations
of patients over an entire region or
state to understanding and improving
public health blessings 9 &amp;amp; 10 show how
data can be aggregated from these
systems and analyzed to gain new
knowledge and even improve the health
care system that generated the data
during this course we'll hear from
experts in various segments of the field
who should help you see how the
knowledge and concepts you're learning
are actually being applied along the way
you'll be able to test your knowledge
with frequent quizzes so I want you to
get used to that interactive format
let's try out an easy question right now
which of these fields involves the use
of computing health informatics
bioinformatics both are neither</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
