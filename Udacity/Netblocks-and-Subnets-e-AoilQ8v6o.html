that are on the same network like an
individual home or business or school
usually have IP addresses that are
similar to each other to be more
specific about it all of the addresses
on a specific network block share a
particular prefix they all start the
same and only differ after some
particular bid position and computers
that are on the same network block can
communicate with each other without
going through a router but not all
networks are the same size so when we
talk about a particular network we have
to talk not only about its network
prefix but the length of that prefix a
network with a longer prefix has less of
the 32-bit address left over to
distinguish particular hosts and a
network with a shorter prefix has more
addresses for hosts so it's a larger
network the network prefix length is
something that has to be chosen when the
network is set up and it's usually
configured by whatever process assigns
addresses to the computers for instance
if you have a network with a 24-bit
prefix that means there's eight bits
left over for the host part of addresses
we would conventionally write this as /
24 for instance 198 dot 51 dot 100 0 /
24 network block but if the network
prefix is shorter say 22 bits then there
would be 10 bits left over host
addressing this would be a / 22 network
and you can't tell how long the prefix
is just by looking at the addresses for
these addresses either a 22 or 24
network would be a possibility so how
many hosts can fit in one of these
networks well 10 bits of host address
means to to the 10th power addresses
which would be a thousand 24 except at
the top and the bottom addresses of a
network block are reserved and the first
address is usually the router so a
thousand and twenty one addresses are
available for hosts similarly in a / 24
network there would be 256 addresses but
minus those three they're usually about
two hundred and fifty three addresses
that remain for hosts now why does this
matter subnet miss configuration can
cause some pretty weird problems on a
server network of spies
Ashley things like one machine thinks
that it can talk to another machine
directly but the other thinks that it
has to talk back through a router and
that can cause very strange
communications problems getting a good
grasp of how this stuff works can save
you a lot of trouble if you're ever
setting up a server network</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
