from examples so I'm going to teach you
something right now from example
something that you almost certainly
don't already know that is whether a
horse is a Souris do you know what a
source means what is a source I'm not
going to tell you I'm going to give you
what you eat I'm going to give you a
bunch of examples and then the question
for you is whether you think a horse is
a stress or not okay okay so here's
here's some examples in Beijing China
has nothing to do with it being a stress
these are some examples I'm going to
tell you for each one whether it's a
stress or not an elephant is a stress a
ram is not a stress let's see a
triceratops the dinosaur is NaN a stress
lemurs are a Souris a dog is a Souris a
giraffe is not a Souris a goat also non
Atrus a cat is going to be a Souris
parrot is a Souris and last a deer is
not a stress and so the question for you
is which one of these groups would you
put the horse in with it's hard I guess
it looks a bit like a giraffe maybe it's
on that side doesn't look like a parrot
I put it here okay so this is the this
is the non a source group yeah how
confident are you in this and not at all
if I gave you a hundred thousand
examples would you be more confident yes
please keep behind a thousand examples
these are all the toys I could find so
before we go any further I'd like you to
give me your answer of what you think
what you think for the horse is it a
source or not a source just based on the
examples here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
