didn't really start learning computer
science until I got to college and you
know I did look around and see that most
of the students around me were were
dudes the the t-shirt for the cs
department or one of the unofficial
funny ones was like nine stick figures
of men and one of women which was the
actual ratio it was almost like a joke
but it's been encouraging to see that
ratio go up when I was growing up in
Hong Kong my mom she ran her own company
and so growing up I watched her be both
I guess the CEO of her own company and a
mom and you know she bounced both and I
never it never occurred to me that it
might be unusual for a woman to be
running her own company and I think I
always had that impression so when it
came time for me to consider that I just
normal just normal yeah that's great you
might look around and not see as many
women just don't be discouraged by that
like still just focus on doing really
really amazing work and connect with
other women who are maybe in the same
space or who've come before you and try
to learn from them but learn from from
both men and women I've had a lot of
female and male mentors and it's it's
been amazing just surround yourself with
the best people I think that's great
advice for anyone advise totally yeah is
any specific things that you encounter
in Salem you have to be more tenacious
or you have to be more aggressive
sometimes well actually I feel like you
have to find your own style you have to
lean into whatever your strengths are I
think as I was figuring out my own
leadership style I looked around at
different role models and found a lot of
male leaders whose style wasn't quite
right for me so I'd to figure out what
my own style was and lead sort of in a
way that was authentic to me and I've
had a couple of different really amazing
role models who taught me it was okay to
sort of let my personality out or not
fit that classic alpha male mold and so
I would say think about that look around
for that and you know find the style
that's right for you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
