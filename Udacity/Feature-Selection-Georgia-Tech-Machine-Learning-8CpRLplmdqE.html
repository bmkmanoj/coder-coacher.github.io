so there's a bunch of reasons but really
it boils down to two one is really about
human beings and the other is really
about machines and machine learning
algorithms and the first one really
boils down to what I'll just call
knowledge discovery right it is often
useful when you're thinking about a set
of data and a problem to be able to
interpret the features to figure out
well which subset of features that I've
been keeping track of say or that I'm
using in my sensors actually matter and
so really the feature selection problem
for what other reasons you might think
of doing it or often good for
interpretability
and for insight so it turns out that of
the 1,000 features that I keep track of
only a few matter maybe only ten of them
matter for doing solving some problem of
prediction so let's think about our spam
case for example there are lots and lots
and lots of features that we might care
about in the spam case but it may turn
out that after we do some kind of
analysis that it really all boils down
to something like whether you're getting
mail from a Nigerian prince for example
and some of these things that you
thought matter don't seem to matter for
for the purposes of solving some problem
or for doing prediction and so often
this is a very very useful thing to do
you do this kind of thing all the time
Michael actually if you go back and you
look at some of the things we've been
giving for examples you come up with
problems and features that are for
example visible in two dimensions as
opposed to three or four or five because
it's easy for you to visualize them and
to understand them and for students to
understand how the algorithms work in 2d
it makes it that'll make sense okay so
that's one thing and there's and this
really should not be underestimated
people tend to ignore this a lot in the
in the at least in the machine learning
field much less in the data mining field
but this really is a sort of key and an
important issue but there's another
reason why I care about it that's
algorithmic and that is the curse of
dimensionality so do you remember what
the curse of dimensionality is Michael
yeah as you add more features you may
need exponentially more data to kind of
fill out the space the curse of
dimensionality says that the amount of
data that you need grows exponentially
in the number of features that you have
so it would be really nice if you could
have fewer features so
the problem of feature selection helps
us hopefully at least in a nice world to
go from a whole bunch of features to
just a few features thus making the
learning problem actually easier looks a
little bit like a smite an alien smiley
face now that's right so we came with an
alien frowny face in the beginning and
then we end up with an alien smiley face
okay so do you buy these reasons Michael
yeah I'd like how you manage to you know
if X is the input space here you've
managed to map X to Y Michael uses the
feature transformation function known as
the pun that's really good I like that
okay anyway okay so let's keep all this
in mind when we're talking about all the
algorithms are we're talking about in
this lesson and even in the future
transformation lesson the goal is to
take but be able to use in general a
bunch of features because you think they
all might be important and then apply
some kind of algorithm to get to just
the important features and if you can do
that well then not only will you
understand your data better but you'll
also have an easier learning problem got
