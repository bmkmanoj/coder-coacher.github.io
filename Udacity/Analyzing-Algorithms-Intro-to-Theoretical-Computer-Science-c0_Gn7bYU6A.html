considerable amount of algorithm
analysis which is why we're going to do
an overview of the techniques and
notations that we're going to use if
you've already had an algorithms course
before and terms like Big O notation or
RAM or a worst-case running time are
already meaningful to you then you might
try and go directly for the quizzes for
the respective sections so let's start
out with a little quiz what I want you
to think about is the various factors
that we need to take into account when
we are analyzing an algorithm or more
precisely when we are analyzing the
running time of an algorithm because
that will depend on a number of factors
what I would like you to think about is
what factors can determine the running
time of an algorithm so here are 6
different possibilities first the size
of the input secondly the content or
structure of the input third the type of
computer that we're using for the
algorithm for the amount of memory the
computer has five how the algorithm is
implemented and six the programming
language that we're using to implement
the algorithm I want you to think of
each of those six aspects and then make
a check mark where you think that this
aspect can influence the running time of
an algorithm</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
