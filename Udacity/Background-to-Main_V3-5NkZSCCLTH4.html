immediately has to do with the fact that
our code is being executed in the
background now I know what you may be
thinking what's the background why's our
code there and how does this affect my
app don't panic without getting into the
details we're going to use a method that
fixes this problem the method we'll use
we'll take any updates that we're making
to the UI like displaying our image and
then run them in the foreground or the
main executing environment let's see
this now back in our project we've been
provided with a special function called
perform UI updates on main this function
is defined in the gcd blackbox
swift all now the reason we use the term
black box in the name of that Swift file
it's because a black box refers to
something you can use without knowing
the internal details so for the purposes
of this course you can use the function
perform UI updates on main without
knowing how it's implemented
you should just call this function any
time you need to make updates to the UI
inside of the completion handler of a
network task now looking at this method
we can see that it takes a closure that
has no parameters and returns void or
nothing and since the closure is the
only parameter we can use the trailing
closure syntax all we need to do is just
relocate any code responsible for
updating the UI and place it inside this
closure so in our case it's just this
line of code here
now let's run the project nice there we
go that's what we want</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
