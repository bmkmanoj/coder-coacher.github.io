from Andrew hide we really wanted to
address the question and how can we as a
society do a better job helping people
become entrepreneurs so what we're
looking for was a curriculum that really
addressed the fundamentals something
that would still maintain the startup
weekend spirit and community and address
their incredible demand so in the first
couple decades in my career I was an
entrepreneur and for a good part at that
time I was teaching the traditional how
to write a business plan class for
entrepreneurs I realized that we were
teaching entrepreneurs the wrong thing
large companies execute known business
models but startups search for business
models so the lean launchpad class
teaches you three things one is how to
use Alexander osterwalder is business
model canvas and design a business model
for your startup's two is it embraces
the idea of customer development how to
get outside the building and turn all
those hypotheses of your business model
into facts and key idea three is how
your product gets implemented is not
with waterfall engineering but with
agile engineering Udacity has taken an
approach that broke the class up into
easily digestible modules and actually
transform them into a unique experience
over the web or on a mobile platform so
if you're as excited as I am it only
takes three things to get a startup week
and next in your local community number
one we need to start a weekend organizer
number to a facilitator and number three
mentors and coaches who can work
one-on-one with teams and last but not
least we need at least you and 29 other
passionate committed entrepreneurs
interested in taking this program so
sign up now and we'll let you know as
soon as we announced an SW next scenario</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
