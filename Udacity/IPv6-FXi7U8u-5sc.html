the shortage of addresses in ipv4 it's a
workaround but the real solution has
already been built and the world is kind
of in the middle of deploying it that
solution is IP version 6 ipv6 is the
successor to ipv4 we're going from four
directly to six because protocol version
5 was an experiment that didn't work out
ipv6 fixes the address shortage problem
by having much longer addresses 128 bits
or 16 octet slong that's four times as
long as an ipv4 address two to the
hundred twenty eighth power is really a
colossally huge number of addresses
billions and billions of times bigger
than the v4 address space in fact the
smallest block of addresses that can be
assigned to an end user like a home in
v6 is a / 64 network which is much
larger than the whole v4 address space
but that means that ipv6 addresses are
kind of long like for instance here's
one of Google's addresses now
fortunately the conventional way of
writing v6 addresses lets us skip
writing these zeros here okay that's
better a little anyway you might notice
that these don't look much like v4
addresses they're written in hex digits
instead of in decimal in blocks of two
bytes separated by colons instead of
dots but remember this is just the human
readable format the network actually
sends these addresses as strings of 128
bits just like v4 we designate the size
of a network block with a decimal number
of bits in the network prefix google has
all of 2607 f8b 0 / 32 and many other v6
blocks as well remember on ipv4 a / 32
means a single address whereas on ipv6
it's a large network with 96 bits of
subnet and host address in it so the
world doesn't need nat with v6 there's
enough addresses for every device to get
a unique public address now ipv6
adoption started out very slow but it's
been growing strong for several years
between mid-2012 and the end of 2015
Google's measurement to v6 traffic they
receive
increased from about half a percent of
all traffic to about ten percent of all
traffic and it's higher on weekends
because more home and mobile users have
v6 than business and office users</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
