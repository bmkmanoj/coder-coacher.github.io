and mitochondrial chromosomes can be
used to trace both the paternal and
maternal lines but let's do a quick
recap to learn why the Y can trace the
paternal side and the mitochondria can
trace the maternal side all right so
let's set up a little scenario here
let's imagine that I have biological
children thank you and I passed out my X
chromosome what sex with the child B be
a female because the mother has two x's
so she can only pass down the X and you
passed out an X and so you have a child
with two x's baby girl exactly now what
happens if I pass down my Y chromosome
well the mother again it only passes
down the X and you gave a Y and so an X
y equals a baby boys you'd have a male
child exactly and we can use this Y
chromosome to trace back father - father
- father and that's how we trace the
paternal line and the mitochondria are
only passed down by the mother so they
trace your maternal line precisely this
means that if you're a male you can
actually submit a DNA sample and you'll
get information about your maternal and
paternal lines because you have both
mitochondria and a Y chromosome but if
you're a female you only have
mitochondria so you can't actually get
your paternal information just from your
own DNA sample you're gonna have to use
someone else in your family I want you
to tell me which of the following
relatives would you not want to use if
you're a female and you want to get
information about your paternal lineage</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
