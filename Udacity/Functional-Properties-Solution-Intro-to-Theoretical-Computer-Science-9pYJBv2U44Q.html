functional property because condition 2
is not fulfilled all computer programs
are computer programs so there's no
computer program that is not a computer
program of course this sounds a bit
silly but it's actually the only example
I could think of where this condition
here is violated a program always
returns one already is a functional
property first of all it describes how
output relates to the input namely
output doesn't care about the input and
is always one and property 2 is also
always satisfied for example there are
computer programs that i could write
that always return to and property 2 is
fulfilled for all the other three as
well so i won't even mention it anymore
a program solves vertex cover yes
definitely that describes an
input-output behavior how output relates
to the input is a computer virus I would
say yes this is a functional property
now it is a bit debatable if saying it
is a computer virus already described
sufficiently how the output relates to
the input but I would say that probably
any definition of a computer virus that
he would give me would in some way
describe what the computer virus is
doing so it might ignore anything that
receives and overwrite your hard disk so
put something in the memory or it might
lock your screen so i would say here the
input-output behavior is variable
depending on how you define computer
virus but it is always defined now the
final one that is a bit of a tricky one
saying that a program only requires
linear time is not a functional property
because that does not describe how the
output relates to the input it is a
property of the program but it is not a
functional property because it doesn't
ask what does the program do and what
does the program do is actually this
relationship here it only asks how fast
is the program at doing that this is
something that is a little more tricky
to figure out but basically anytime that
you ask can a program to X that will be
a functional property that you're asking
for at least in almost any of the cases</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
