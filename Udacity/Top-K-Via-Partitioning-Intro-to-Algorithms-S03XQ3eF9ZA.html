solve the top-k problem using this idea
of partitioning now remember what we're
given here is a list l and some number K
and what we're interested in are the top
K elements of L and for the sake of
simplicity in this example by top I mean
smallest the ones that have the smallest
values you can always flip things around
turn the right greater thans into less
stands and so forth and and everything
will be fixed but for now let's just
imagine that we're interested in the
smallest element are the smallest K
elements and if the list were sorted so
here's what we're going to do we're
going to start off remember what we know
how to do with partitioning is given
some value V when I don't know which
value to use so let's just pick one at
random so here I am picking a value at
random let's say there so there's our
value V and now we're going to run the
partitioning algorithm on this and
there's a couple different cases it can
happen so we're going to look first at
this case too because that's the super
duper easy one so in this case too we we
picked some viet random and it just so
happens that we totally lucked out and
the rank of V is exactly K so what
happens when we run partitioning on that
value V is it's going to separate all
the values of L into the ones smaller
than V equal to V and greater than V and
that happens to be a position K so the
ones on the first k position here are
exactly the top K for the list the
smallest K elements that we were looking
for so in this case we're done we lucked
out but that's only one of the three
cases we need to look at the other cases
