a charge attracting opposite charges so
in fact something very similar happens
when a lightning cloud comes overhead
these clouds tend to have a lot of
negative charge built up at the bottom
of them haven't talked about how yet but
this negative charge gets there and what
happens is this negative charge in the
clouds causes some of the negative
charges in the ground to be repelled
leaving a deficit of electrons and
excess of protons this causes the ground
to actually become slightly positively
charged this concept of polarization is
essential to the functioning of what
we're going to find is Benjamin
Franklin's solution to saving buildings
from lightning strikes let's actually
think about what would happen if instead
of being a perfect sphere we change the
shape of our conductor because notice
that with a sphere well the negative
charges have a large surface over which
they can distribute themselves what have
we made this at pointy shape not a
sphere but a cone well I still expect
polarization to happen but qualitatively
is there any real difference between
what happened with the sphere and what
happened with a cone at the tip of this
cone is the concentration or density of
negative charges higher than it was with
a sphere lower or the same and I admit
this is a quite a tricky question think
about it and take your best guess but
don't worry if you're wrong</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
