somehow depends on force and mass we're
going to design an experiment to figure
out how first I want to find out how
does acceleration relate to force maybe
a is proportional to the force maybe
it's purporting to one over the force
well maybe is proportional to force
squared or something else I just don't
know yet but we can figure it out with
an experiment in this experiment we're
going to take a 10 kilogram cart that's
its mass and we're going to apply
differing forces on it we're then going
to time how long it takes to go 10
meters and using some of our motion
equations that we learned in the last
unit we're going to figure out the
acceleration once we get enough data we
can see how acceleration depends on
force for the first one in the
experiment we'll push with a force of 10
Newtons and this is a new unit but it's
the unit we use to measure force and of
course named after Isaac Newton and we
find that it takes a time four point
four seven seconds now what must the
acceleration have been you may want to
use this equation and remember that the
card is starting from rest enter your
answer here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
