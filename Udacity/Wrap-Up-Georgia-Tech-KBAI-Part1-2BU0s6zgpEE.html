today we started off today by talking
about state spaces and we use this to
frame our discussion of means-ends
analysis means its analysis is a very
general purpose problem solving method
that allows us to look at our goal and
try to continually move towards it we
then use means-ends analysis to try and
address a couple of different kinds of
problems but when we did so we hit an
obstacle to overcome that obstacle we
use problem reduction we can use problem
reduction a lot of other problem solving
context but here we use it specifically
to overcome the obstacle we hit during
means-ends analysis problem reduction
occurs when we take a big hard problem
and reduce it into smaller easier
problems by solving the smaller easier
problems we solve the big hard problem
next time we're going to talk about
production systems which is the last
part of the fundamentals area of our
course but if you're particularly
interested in what we've talked about
today you may wish to jump forward to
logic and planning those will build
specifically on the types of problems we
talked about the day and in fact in
planning we'll see a more robust way of
solving the kinds of obstacles that we
hit during our exercise with means-ends
analysis earlier in this lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
