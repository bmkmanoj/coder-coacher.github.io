page is really important but sometimes
you'll need to manage focus at the
component level as well especially if
you're building a complex custom widget
to show you what I mean take a look at
this native select tag and notice how i
can focus it and once there i can use
the arrow keys to expose additional
functionality like selecting different
options if you were building a custom
select element yourself or something
similar like a drop-down you would need
to expose these same kinds of behaviors
so that your users who rely primarily on
the keyboard could still interact with
your control now knowing which keyboard
behaviors to implement can be a bit of a
guessing game but thankfully there's a
really helpful guide which you can refer
to the Aria design pattern stock lists
various kinds of components as well as
the sorts of keyboard interactions that
they support now alice is going to cover
Aria and more detail in the following
sections but for now let's use this
guide to help us add keyboard support to
a new component which we're going to
build</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
