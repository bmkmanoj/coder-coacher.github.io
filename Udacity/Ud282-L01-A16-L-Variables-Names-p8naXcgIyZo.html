first name variable earlier did you
notice how I used some capital letters
in the name here this is called camel
case because it resembles the humps of a
camel back however the first letter here
seemed to be a lowercase letter this is
called the lower camel case another
variation is called the upper camel case
they're both commonly used in Java but
in different places for now however just
remember that you should always follow
the lower camel case when you're
creating a new variable name like this
one here you can always write variable
names the way you want as long as you
follow some basic rules which we will go
through in a second but it's very common
to use camel cases when we create
variable names that have more than just
one single word because as we'll see we
can't have spaces between the words in a
variable name this camel case makes it a
lot easier to read than say having them
all lowercase letters like that so what
are those rules that we need to follow
on creating variable names variable
names are totally up to you you should
always try to use full words that
describe what this variable is used for
like speed or price try to avoid using
cryptic abbreviations like SP for stock
price instead you should use the camel
case format and name your variable stock
price like that but always keep in mind
those rules first one is that variable
names are case sensitive just like any
instruction in Java variable names are
also case sensitive which means if we
try to use this variable stock price
here in a statement like this but with a
small lowercase P instead of this
uppercase P here then Java won't
understand what this variable is because
it would assume this is a different
variable and it won't find it in our
program so you have to follow the same
case of the variables that you've
declared it earlier this was why Java
would not understand this statement
second rule is that you have to start
your variable names with a letter like
an alphabetical letter even though you
can have numbers and symbols within your
variable name the first letter O
has to be an alphabetical letter so a
variable like this which starts with a
digit - is wrong and Java won't accept
it you can however start a variable with
a dollar sign or underscore sign only
those two are acceptable but it's not
recommended to do so anyway final rule
is that you cannot have white spaces in
your variable name it has to be one
single word something like this
strings stock price for example with a
space between stock and price does not
make sense and Java won't accept that
either so as long as you follow these
basic three rules and you keep in mind
that your variable names explain what
the variable is used for then your
program would make a lot more sense when
someone else is reading it another thing
you can do while deploying a variable is
initialize it in the same statement
something like this where we have the
string player variable being declared
here I can actually assign that to a
value straight away so in this one
statement I'm declaring the variables
player and I'm also initializing it to
the string jack same goes for integers
where I can declare an integer price and
initialize it to zero or another integer
speed initialize it to 100 and so on so
remember that if you want to compact
your code to lessen the number of lines
in your program you can always
initialize the variable while declaring
it this also guarantees that you would
never use a variable without having it
initialized which is a really important
thing to think about in your programs</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
