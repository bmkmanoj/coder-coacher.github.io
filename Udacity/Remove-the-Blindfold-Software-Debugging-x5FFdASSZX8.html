debugging let me illustrate this with
the game of mastermind you know
mastermind don't you your opponent has
four pinned hidden behind a board and
your job is to guess the colors of these
pens so you come up with one trial and
you get points for every color that's in
the right position and for every color
that's correct but not in the right
position this is what your opponent
tells you and so you make one attempt
after the other until after normally
seven eight attempts or so you finally
guessed the right combination mastermind
is a prime example of applying the
scientific method coming up with one
experiment after the other to validate
or reject a hypothesis on what's behind
these bars and then based on your
observations you come up with a new
hypothesis and a new hypothesis that you
gradually refine your hypothesis until
you find the answer now when you're
playing mastermind you always record
what you tried before and what the
result was it's this is the same as
explicit debugging you write down what
you do and what the result was and this
is what makes you effective not writing
down what you do is like clay mastermind
with a blindfold trying to remember all
the combinations and all the results
sure you can do that you're a great
thinker you're a smart person you could
probably also play Mass to my blood but
why do that if you can simply look at
what you already did interrupt the
session at any time and resume later at
wish think about your significant other
and remove your blindfold</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
