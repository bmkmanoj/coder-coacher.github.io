got our 23 meal results back and Johanna
is actually gonna walk us through the
results Johanna what do we do first well
let's go and login and then we get to
choose to look at health results first
or ancestry results and I typically like
to look at someone's ancestry results
first because that really gives us
contacts for the rest okay let's go do
that okay Joe and I just pulled up the
page right okay so the first thing we do
Matt is is sign in here if you want to
clean up here let me put in my login
information yep great and the bunch of
options for where to start here but I
suggest we start with ancestry overview
and I suggest we the the most broad
overview of your ancestry is in this
feature called ancestry composition and
we already can tell from this that about
1/4 of your ancestry traces back to
Britain and Ireland yep and this is what
we call a ring chart this is Matt cooks
ring chart and let's get a little more
detail by clicking the plus sign there
and if you click it one more time that's
when we get down to the level of the of
Britain and Ireland that the 1/4 British
and Irish as indicated by that blue ring
there mm-hmm
and it's so overall your ancestry traces
to Northern Europe just like me okay and
if you look that's where most of your
ancestry traces to you know close to 98%
traces to Northern Europe and nothing I
don't see anything tracing to southern
Europe but one curious thing if you
click right here on sub-saharan Africa
there's like just just less than a
percent of your ancestry traces back to
to Africa and that what I want to do is
to look at where on your genome that
segment that traces back to Africa is so
okay we're now looking at this is the
range chart view let's go and change
from the map view to the chromosome view
chromosome view yes oh wow
and so we see that if we look at
chromosome so each of these pairs of
bars is a pair of chromosomes and we've
heard throughout the course about pairs
of chromosomes coming from mother and
father so that's what we're looking at
here we start with the longest
chromosome number one mm-hmm number two
is next and we go all the way down to
chromosome 22 and then the X chromosome
here is here you know we have one
you only have one which is indicative of
you being male which I think you already
knew that but it's always nice when your
DNA results are consistent with
something you already know that just
sees a kind of a check it's something we
actually check we asked all the
customers to tell us if they're male or
female and then we look at their DNA to
see if it's concerned that just helped
us know that these are really all your
data great and what I was curious about
was this red strip here so what we can
see most of them is bars the chromosomes
are a shade of blue and that indicates
ancestry from Europe or or Britain in
Ireland now but there's there are some
other colors here and the red refers to
sub-saharan African ancestry which of
the chromosomes seems to have at least a
segment tracing back to Africa</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
