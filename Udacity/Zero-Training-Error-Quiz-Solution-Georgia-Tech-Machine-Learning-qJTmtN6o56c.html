yeah I think so I kind of like the
method of dropping features that we
don't need so let's see if I can apply
that idea so for the decision tree case
if I had all four features could I even
learn this thing I think I could say I
can do a and if a is true then I can
split on B and if B is true then I'll
put a plus
otherwise I output minuses so hmm is
that a function do you know what
function that is it's a decision tree
yes but what do you know there's a
boolean function that decision tree
represents I don't you want to draw it
and I can look at it yeah sure
let's do that so first you split on a
and you said a is either 0 or 1 and then
in the case where as a 1 you split on B
and if that were a 0 you output no and
if that is a 1 you output yes
and over here you don't put no that's
what you said right yep and that works
for this example mm-hmm or this set of
examples and let's see so with 1 plus oh
I see so it's um it's and right so if a
and B are true then the outputs true
otherwise not right and in fact that is
exactly the function that I was thinking
of so this the true underlying function
here is in fact and of a and B all right
and oh I see so in particular now we've
answered the first question because I
need ok I only need a and B and in fact
having just one of them alone isn't
going to be enough if I just had a then
the decision tree can't learn it and if
I just hit B then it's it and she can't
learn it needs more information right
and even these examples you haven't you
can't really look up and have pick C or
D to learn this because C is always 1 so
you can't output the correct answer for
all cases and D is one in the wrong
place and 0 in the wrong place but 0 in
the right place a couple of times so you
can't do something like take the nod of
D and haven't gotten lucky I see well
yeah and C in particular seems
exceptionally useless like that word
useless
useless okay fine so that's right so it
and maybe this helps you a little bit
with the next one I know that you now
know what the true function is is and A
or B and you decided that D doesn't help
a lot and C is completely useless why'd
you say it was useless by the way
because it's the same in all the cases
it doesn't discriminate between the
positive and the negative labels that's
right so it is useless in that regard so
good this is the answer I was looking
for for decision trees what about for
the simple perceptron okay all right so
I'm not great at doing this kind of
thing in my head but I guess the good
news is oh how about this how about this
since we got it down to only these two
features matter we can draw it as
two-dimensional plane right okay
so mark is your zero put a minus at 0 0
okay put a minus at 0 1 mm-hm
put a minus at 1 0 mm-hmm and put a plus
at 1 1 so that's when we're using the a
and the B features and this is great
because it's linearly separable so we
just need yeah we just need a set of
weights that can do that and let's see
so how do we do that so if we add let's
see if we do a weight of 1 on a and a
weight of 1 on B mm-hmm
let me draw it or maybe they don't that
helps so you want to pick a weight
vector which is you said 1 for a and 1
for B okay all right go and that will
give us for the first example that gives
us an output of 0 for the next one an
output of 1 the next one an output of 1
and the last one an output of 2 so we
would like if it was like oh wait so if
the weight vector was that then what we
really want it to be is wtx greater than
1 but we can't it says 0 there mm-hmm
in fact wait isn't it the case that if
you don't have if it's greater than
equals 0 it's really we really talking
about lines that go through the origin
yep that's right this is an origin
limited perceptron so it seems like
we're we're hosed right but there isn't
going to be a separator that goes to the
origin that lops off the plus that's
right so I guess what we usually do in
percent
is we include was it like a bias unit
like a like a something that's all ones
and then that lets us move the threshold
around right so normally this would look
like this w transpose X plus B is
greater than zero but I didn't let you
have that so you can't have that ah but
maybe I can you say I can add B in what
if I could add C it because if you look
at this well look at the C column it's
all ones it's the same as if it was like
the thing that you called be a moment
ago that this this bias unit so if we
actually include a B and C as our
features then we can represent this with
a what did you call it origin limited
perceptron right so then you know I'll
even draw it in different color if we
had WB but do you have one one and I'm
gonna say negative one negative one and
that's a B and C then what would that
give you in the first case so negative 1
0 0 1 yep so it's only the positive
example is the own isn't the only one
that's greater than 0 strictly greater
than 0 yep that's exactly right so you
still think C is useless I see well when
I said useless mm-hmm
I meant it didn't give any information
and that's exactly right it doesn't give
any information but that does not make
it useless interesting okay why now
regret that word choice C's everywhere
across the world are thank you so this
actually brings me to the last point
that I want to make about feature
selection which really gets down to
noticing the difference between useless
and what I'm gonna call relevance so
let's dive into that okay yeah that that
would be really helpful is that and
that's the right answer that the first
three yes that's the right answer
cool</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
