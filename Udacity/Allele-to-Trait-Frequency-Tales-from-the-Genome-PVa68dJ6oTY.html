frequencies up here for the dominant
recessive alleles but what about the
trait itself how frequent is the trait
of lactose intolerance and our
population well are both are homozygous
dominant and our heterozygous condition
are going to be lactase persistent and
are homozygous recessive condition is
going to be lactase non-persistent this
is the group that's going to be lactose
intolerant so if we calculate the
frequency of lactase persistence in my
population then we've got 500 plus 300
is 850 total people out of a thousand
that's point eight five look at that the
frequency of the dominant allele is
point 675 the frequency of the dominant
trait is point eight five they're not
the same this is really important the
allelic frequency in the trade frequency
don't have to match take this given
scenario right here we have a population
of a thousand people remember that means
we have two thousand alleles total and
when we calculate our allelic frequency
we find that the dominant allele for
lactase persistence is prevalent at a
point seven-five frequency the recessive
allele is prevalent at 8.25 frequency
when we look at the actual trait
frequency lactase persistence comes in
at one point oh one hundred percent but
lactase non-persistent the trait of
lactose intolerance is zero zero percent
now if these things are true that I want
you to enter a possible number of people
for each genotype here remember you have
a thousand people to choose from so
whatever your numbers you put in these
boxes it should add up to a thousand
based on the allelic and the trait
frequencies that you see here I want you
to enter in any possible number of
people that could be each genotype go
ahead give it a try if you get stuck try
checking out the forums to see if anyone
has some helpful advice</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
