this classes AI ethics often scientists
go about doing science without asking
questions about the ethics or the
science to do we are all so engrossed in
questions of funding and proposals and
papers however part of our job a
scientist is to ask the question about
are we doing the right kind of things
there are a large number of questions
connected with the ethics of a I will
post a small number here today there are
no easy answers to these questions so
you invite you to discuss these
questions on the forum first air ethics
pertain to our economy and our society
we have talked a lot in this course
about designing agents that can act and
think and behave like humans however in
the process we quite likely will replace
some human jobs or robots we have talked
for example of robots that can assemble
a camera does this mean that humans who
assembly cameras today will lose their
jobs of course a counter-argument is
that new job might be created for
example jobs for designing robots
nevertheless there are hard issues about
the ethical implications of AI in terms
of human economy and society second much
of the modern development of AI is
driven by defense applications all
across the world we already have drones
for example it is not far-fetched to
imagine a future where their robot
soldiers on the battlefield what are the
implications of introducing robot
soldiers should we build morality into
these soldiers how do we do so and if
you had to build morality into robots
what does it teach us about our own
morality a third and related question is
that if we start building human
characteristics like creativity and
morality into AI agents at what point of
his agents become like humans at what
point do we start talking about civil
rights for these machines because they
are indistinguishable from humans the
idea has been touched upon in the
popular culture a lot but it is coming
closer and closer to reality what are
the criteria under which we would
consider machines to be equal to humans</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
