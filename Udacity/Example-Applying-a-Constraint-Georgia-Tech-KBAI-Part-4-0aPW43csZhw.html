order in which a customer wants a chair
that weighs over 200 grams costs at most
20 dollars and as four legs given the
specification what configuration process
can use this knowledge to fill in the
values of all the variables to satisfy
the specification so the first thing the
process might do is to write down all
the constraints that are given as part
of the input specification so the mass
is greater than 200 grams the cost is
less than twenty dollars and the count
of legs is for now suppose that the
configuration process has an abstract
plan which first decides on the value of
the cost variable before it decides on
other variables it is also further
suppose that this plan for deciding any
cost evenly distributes the cost between
the various components until unless
specified otherwise by the specification
in this case the cost plan distributes
this cost of twenty dollars between the
four components are assigned less than
five for each one of them now we define
an expanded plan this has two aspects to
it refine and expand and the expand
aspect we deal with the components
instead of the chair as a whole and the
refined aspect we deal with more
detailed variables that were not there
in the chair consider the component legs
for example we already know the count
for only input specification we know the
cost no more than five dollars from the
higher level plan now we can designer
the values of the other two variables 25
grams in word for example and we could
do the same for the other components as
we assign values to the variables each
of these components we get a complete
arrangement of all the components here
with values assigned to each of the
variables given the specific values we
assigned to the variables each of the
components we cannot compute whether the
constraints given an input specification
are satisfied in this particular example
both the mass and the cost of the clear
satisfy the input constraints noted they
refine and expand step in this
particular process might have operated a
little differently it is also possible
the define and expand step might say
that let's decide any material before we
decide on any of the other features
let's within the scope of this
configuration process different
designers may use
and plants and different planned
refinery expansion mechanisms of course
it is also possible that once we have a
candidate solution the candidate
solution may not necessarily satisfy the
input constraints so the cost may turn
out to be more than twenty dollars for
example in that case there are two
options either we can iterate on the
process loading the costs or we can go
about changing to specification</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
