wearables is that some watches around
and this is a new screen shape that has
never been dealt with before so if
you're designing a wearable app you
could have a round watch or a square
watch there are two ways to deal with
this you could design separate layouts
for round and square watches or you can
design everything for a square and use
what we call a box inset layout to
ensure that the content always fits
within the circle the downside is that
it wastes this space on the edges the
nice part about box and set layout is
that it provides a box for your app to
draw in and it promises that it will
never make the square leak outside the
round area there is a sample called
delayed confirmation that uses box inset
layout let's start the sample up file
import sample delayed confirmation next
and then create the sample with the
defaults the samples of a tricky to run
since it was not meant to be used
without a phone app triggering it off
you cannot run it using the green play
button like usual if you try to run it
it'll prompt you to select a default
activity but it can't find one this is
the error message that you'll get so to
fix this we need to load up the Android
manifest file and make a correction we
add Android exported equals true for the
activity and now it will be able to be
found so we've got to run it we also
specify the default activity so we
select main activity here and now we can
run it on the device we select our
device and we had ok so you can see it
as added padding to the top for the
round display but not anywhere else
let's open up the layout main activity
XML you can see there is an app layout
box equals top here if you change it to
all it'll box all the sides of the
display if you set it to none or forget
to add this the box and set layout will
do nothing so make sure you get this
right let's run it again now after
making this change you can see it
working and now boxing all sides and
easy but inefficient way of designing is
to always designed for a round shape and
never ever put anything in any of the
corners on the edges this is easy
because you only need to maintain a
single layout however the downside is
that the unused corners on the square
watch might look weird and it wastes a
lot of space this it's probably not a
great idea finally the most complete way
to do layouts for round and square is to
use watch viewstub this layout will
inflate
the rect layout or the round layout
depending on the screen shape you can
specify two separate layout files and do
a completely independent layout for both
types the sample that we compiled and
ran at the start of this lesson used
watch viewstub to show either hollow
round world or hollow square world the
catch with this layout is that you need
to carefully maintained both layouts
making sure that the same ids are
present in both files</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
