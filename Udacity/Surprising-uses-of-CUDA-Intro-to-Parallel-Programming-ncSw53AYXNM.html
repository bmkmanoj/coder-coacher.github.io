last five years in terms of how coot has
developed now people have used it no
I'll throw one thing out there I I think
the day that I was disclosed on CUDA
right before it launched if you'd asked
me at the time I would have said you
know in five years maybe people aren't
gonna be programming so much and could
instead people are gonna build the
higher-level languages on top of this
and that's what we're gonna be using but
could is really proven to have legs and
and is a very efficient way to keep
these machines busy with lots of work to
do so you know I certainly would have
lost a bet I made them what have been
some of the things that have surprised
you I think one of the things that
surprised me most is just the diversity
of fields and really you can't predict
it in some more some regards but you can
I there are there are applications for
computing in tons of spaces and we have
a vision of you know if computation is
free what would that mean and what would
it mean for everyone and we can inspire
ourselves but there are all these
short-term things that we can go
achieved with GPUs that were simply just
not no one thought of there may be a
small group of people out there that
we're researching them but you by giving
them this sort of this processor where
computation is effectively free and
memory bandwidth is 10 to 100x faster
than what you're used to
they're just unleashed Astro GPU there's
a actual conference now I'm doing
astronomy simulations with GPUs and they
were the one of the first people that
jump on the bandwagon because they have
a really big problem they're trying to
simulate galaxies and and black holes
and star formation and they were just
stuck they couldn't they the simulations
were so hard and there they maybe get to
run on a supercomputer for a brief few
cycles it was time but now all these
guys are doing to do their computing
right at their desktop and actually
prove theory about how stars forms how
galaxies forms I mean this is a thing we
know one never knew about existed this
kind of problem that existed because
it's little communities off to
themselves but we discover these things
and we're so excited to see that we make
a difference</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
