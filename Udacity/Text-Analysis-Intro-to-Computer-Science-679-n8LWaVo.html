analysis which is a really important
problem for search engines if we want to
be able to do a better job of
identifying the rate documents so tell
us how that works so there's lots of
different approaches but the model that
we tend to take transforms them into a
really nice hash table representation so
text is long and unwieldy and
unstructured and front of us flows and
goes but computers like things that are
nice and structured in a minimal in
familiar things like lists hash tables
etc so what we've got is a way to turn
unstructured text into a data structure
that computers are really happy with and
one of those is the hash table in
general so we can start with a document
that says Obama announces candidacy and
we can turn that into a representation
of that document you know even perfect
representation that just says okay let's
keep track of every word and the number
of times that word appeared in a
document so we would just go through and
say Obama so go to the hash table and
hash Obama and make sure the value
associated with it is one similarly
announces hashes to one and Canada see
hashes to one if we were dealing with
longer documents these values would grow
in the number of elements in the hash
table will grow as well and then we come
across document to what we can represent
that with a whole new hash table Barack
Obama elected Barack Maps to one Obama
pass to one elected maps to one I know
you know if it also said president down
here we'd add more and more keys and
keep track of the value associated with
each one when it comes time to relating
documents to each other like we would do
with our search engine we can look and
say hey you know what there's an overlap
between these two documents and the fact
that they both used a lot and if we've
got enough documents and if there's
enough patterns between them then we can
start seeing hey you know what I'm
seeing this pattern of Barack
shows up in a lot of them or candidacy
or announcements team to come from him a
lot and now you gotta weigh in expanding
this keyword that maybe you were
searching for Obama the search ending to
take oh when you say Obama you're really
talking about this why pantheon of
topics that all have to do with the 44th
presidency so how did you get started
working on this well I was an electrical
engineer and I went from circuits to
signals to statistical signal processing
and it turns out I was working on you
know how do you tell of a cellphone
sending a 1 or a 0 and the math behind
that Lunda being broadly applicable to
general problems including how do we
tell this email is spam or not and
that's kind of the entree to text
processing in general from my background
see so what's the next step in well a
lot of the stuff that we work with all
comes down being able to compare two
documents and then finding out how that
comparison maps to whatever your target
is you know detecting spam around and
all that works really well if the
documents are next to each other living
close to each other within a single
system but that gives you a maximum of
how many documents can analyze so
distributing the solutions and solvers
to these problems is I think where a lot
of energy is being put forth</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
