application start with a single View
application will change this later next
and make sure you don't select use core
data even though we are going to use
core data if you select this Xcode will
add a lot of code to your application
delegate and that's not the place where
it belongs so don't select that and
we'll add this code manually later we'll
call our application cool notes Swift
iPhone we're all set now let's create a
model for a Notes app the first step is
to add a data model file to our project
the default name is model but you can
name it whatever you see fit now go
ahead and create your own there seems to
be three things we can create here
entities fetch requests and
configurations let's start with entities
entities are a way of describing the
classes of your model entities will be
turned into Swift classes by Xcode and
this is actually the only thing that we
will create in here fetch requests can
also be added to the data model however
I prefer to keep my model as simple as
possible so we'll create them through
code last but not least we have this
configuration thing this is an extremely
cool and powerful tool in core data it
allows us to save several different
stores at the same time for instance the
common combination is to have a sequel
store and an in-memory store the latter
behaves as a cash for objects that might
live in the cloud a configuration
specifies to which store each entity
belongs to as you probably already
guessed configurations are advanced core
data so let's set them aside for the
time being in the next video we'll start
creating some entities</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
