explicit in how we want to format our
dates rather than using some intelligent
default the dimple chooses going back to
our editor a quick fix for this problem
is to simply add a date parse format to
our x-axis in this case setting it to
percent capital y and while these
strings might seem mysterious it's
actually an old unix standard called str
f time and most programming languages
and libraries implemented so if you've
ever worked with a date in another
language such as our or python this
should seem familiar what this line
tells us is to parse the date on the
x-axis which corresponds to year
according to this format percent capital
y % capital y actually stands for a
four-digit year for example 1966 1970
and there's many other ways to interpret
your dates but I don't want to spend
time now going over every possible way
to use this str f time string so i've
left a cheat sheet in the instructor
notes and if we refresh our page now
you'll notice that as we hover over any
bar the dates are correct in this case
1962 in this case 1966 one quirk of this
that they're still placed at the first
of the year in this case january first
which is in the exact date the game was
at or this world cup was held since most
of them happen in the summers but for
simplicity let's not worry about this
and as long as we have the year that's
all we're interested in</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
