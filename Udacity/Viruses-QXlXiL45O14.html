of malware a virus infects a program by
modifying the program code so that when
a program runs the virus code also runs
it then self copy into other programs
and thus spread itself there are many
four stages in the life cycle of a virus
the first is a dormant face this is the
face when a program has just been
infected by virus but a program has not
run yet so the virus has not been
triggered or spread the second stage is
publication this is when the malware is
being sent around or spread for example
the malware can come as an email
attachment and the email attachment is
being sent to many uses the third phase
is the Chickering face this is when the
host program is being run and as a
result the virus is also trigger to run
for example when a user clicks an email
attachment that contains a virus is
Chickering the virus to run as well the
fourth stage is the execution phase this
is when the virus code runs performs
some malicious activities and most
importantly he looks for targets too in
fact so that he can spread for example
in a case of email attachment when the
virus runs he can search for users in
address book and then send email
attachment with the virus to users in
the address book and that's how it can
be propagated triggered executed and
again propagated triggered and executed
and this is how virus spreads</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
