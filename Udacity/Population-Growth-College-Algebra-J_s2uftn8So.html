about these three types of models let's
talk about some specific examples that
fit each of them we're going to look at
a pretty wide variety of topics
population growth carbon dating and
sound now earlier on in the course we
did talk about population growth but we
did this with pandas now we're going to
do it with humans there's pretty great
data out there for how many people there
are in the world and we're going to
check this out all the way from 1800 up
through 2011 let's take a look at some
numbers so here's a chart showing how
the world population has changed and
those two hundred-plus years in 1803 1
billion people and by 2011 there were
seven billion let's take a look at what
this looks like on a graph looking at
how this data is plotted what kind of
model do you think this fits best does
this look like exponential growth does
it look like exponential decay or does
it look like logarithmic growth</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
