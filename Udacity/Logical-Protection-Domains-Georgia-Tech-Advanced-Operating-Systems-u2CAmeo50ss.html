with built-in safety and encapsulation
mechanisms it does automatic management
of memory that is since it does
automatic storage management there are
no memory leaks modular 3 supports a
data abstraction called an object with
well-defined entry points only the entry
points are known outside the object not
the implementation of the code for that
entry point or the data structures that
are contained within an object and
therefore there's no cheating possible
as you can do with a language like C and
modulo 3 allows exposing the externally
visible methods inside an object using
generic interfaces it also supports the
notion of threads that execute in the
context of the object and it allows
raising exceptions for example when
there is a memory access violation all
of the features that I mentioned here in
a nutshell allows implementing system
services as an object with well-defined
entry points thus modular 3 allows the
creation of logical protection domains
what you can do from outside the object
is what the entry point methods that are
inside the object will let you do and no
more in other words we are getting the
safety property of a monolithic kernel
without having to put system code in a
separate hardware address space so in
other words the logical protection
domains give you both protection and
performance the two things that we
strive for
now what about flexibility well the
generic interface mechanism allows you
to have multiple instances of the same
service and a given application may be
able to exploit the different instances
of services that are available that
the same genetic interface and that's
the way you can get flexibility as well
and objects that implement specific
services can be at the desired
granularity of the system designer it
can be fine-grained or it can be a
collection you can think of individual
hardware resources as fine-grained
object for example a page frame and what
you can do with a particular page frame
you can have interfaces that provide a
certain functionality that can be what
an object is for example a page
allocation module can be an object and
you can also make a collection of
interfaces into an object for example an
entire virtual memory subsystem can be
an object that is hierarchically
composed of page allocation module and
within that you may have hardware
resources defined as objects as well and
all of these objects whether it is at
the course level of a collection of
interfaces or individual interface that
is a component of this collection or
specific hardware resources all of those
are accessible via our capabilities
now the word capability may give you
jitters because I just now said that
capabilities traditionally in the
operating system parlance signifies a
heavyweight mechanism but because we are
dealing with a strongly typed language
capabilities two objects can be
supported as pointers or in other words
the programming language supported
pointers can serve as capabilities to
the objects so now with this idea access
to the resources that is entry point
functions within an object that is
representing a specific resource is
provided via capabilities that are
simply language supported pointers and
because their language supported
pointers these capabilities that
talking about here are much cheaper
compared to real capabilities as was
used in the Hydra operating system</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
