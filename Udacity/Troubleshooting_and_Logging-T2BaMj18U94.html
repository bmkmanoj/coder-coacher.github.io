multi-project Android builds we should
talk about how to figure out what's
going on when your build fails while
it's technically possible to attach a
debugger to Gradle if you really know
what you're doing the first line of
defense should really be thorough
logging Gradle logs messages in one of
six levels debug spews a ton of only
occasionally useful information on
Grails internal workings info gives much
better insight into what Gradle is up to
it details how long each task takes to
complete and other high-level events
like when Gradle connects to is daemon
lifecycle logs what tasks are currently
being run as well as the total time the
build took and whether or not it was
successful quiet is the level for log
messages that should be displayed even
when the user has told Gradle to be
quiet but there aren't any errors also
any print line statements in the build
scripts are actually redirected to the
quiet log level finally air is exactly
what it sounds like
by default Gradle displays all logs at
the lifecycle level and above running
with the dash D flag gives all logs at
the debug level or above which is all of
them the - I flag gives all logs at the
info level and above and finally - Q
gives only quiet and error logs remember
again that print line statements are
equivalent to the quiet logging level
this means that even if the user uses
the - queue option print line statements
will still appear in the log when the
Gradle build script fails to complete it
doesn't display the stack trace by
default if you want to see the stack
trace just of your code use the stack
trace option or the dash S flag to see
the entire stack trace including Gradle
core code you can use the - full stack
trace option or a capital S again make
sure the difference between these two is
that the partial stack trace is
lowercase s and the full stack trace
uppercase s</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
