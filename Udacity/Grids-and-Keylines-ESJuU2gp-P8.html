for how things can be grouped together
to communicate relationships let's talk
about the specifics of laying things out
on the screen material design uses an 8
dip grid to align components text the
lines to afford it baseline grid let's
take a closer look at the grid so you
can see it a bit clearer notice that for
finer green control the base lines of
text sit on a four dip grid that's kind
of a subset of this 8 dip grid so things
like image in icon sizes spacing margins
and padding's are all multiples of 8 dip
so things like 16 72 40 and 16 those are
multiples of 8 and for text line heights
are multiples of 4 so 20 dip these 8 dip
and 4 dip grids allow us to easily apply
the laws of grouping and keep our UI is
organized balanced and in harmony with
the rest of the operating system there
are material design templates and
stencils that use this grid available
for Adobe Illustrator Photoshop and
sketch check the instructors notes for
links to them even though there's a grid
we need a couple other pieces to lay out
our UIs
key lines are used to vertically or
horizontally align objects in a user
interface aesthetically they enforce a
sense of order in a UI they also make it
much quicker to scan the screen and take
in the information the material design
spec suggests some common key lines to
use in mobile design using 16 bit
margins from the left and right for
auxilary content like icons and avatars
and so on and 72 dips from the left edge
for the primary content the things like
the page title and the page contents now
if you don't have auxilary content then
you're your primary content should
probably also align to the 16 dip key
line and the exact value of these key
lines is less important than the concept
aligning content to bring order to your
UI and making it quicker to visually
parse before we move further let me pass
it over to James to have you apply these
concepts in Android studio</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
