contains code to access the physical
resources that is contained in a
computer system and arbitrate among
competing requests for those hardware
resources coming from multiple
applications that may be running
simultaneously on the processing
platform so in other words the operating
system is just a program like any other
program you may have written okay
slightly more complex than a HelloWorld
program I'm being facetious here
intentionally but you get the point it's
a matter of climbing the ladder of
programming just like a ball player may
start from tee ball to Little League
does a minor league and then two majors
you can also do it if Microsoft can do
it you can do it if you can write a
hello world program today you can
eventually write an entire operating
system so what the operating system
provides a well-defined API for
accessing the hardware resources that
are managed by the operating system and
these resources are provided as
operating system services through this
well-defined interfaces and an
application may make a request to the
operating system for such hardware
resources through this well-defined
API interface and the application we are
the response from the operating system
gets the services from the operating
system via these API calls</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
