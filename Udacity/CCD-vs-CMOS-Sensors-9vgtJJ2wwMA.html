and that is the use of a CMOS sensor
CMOS stands for complementary
metal-oxide-semiconductor again has a
lot of things that it has learned from
ccd but a CMOS of course is a little
cheaper and it's something which
actually you will be you're using all
the time because most of the cameras
small cameras that you see and in fact
even the high-end cameras now all move
to using CMOS sensors as opposed to C
CDs here are a few interesting
differences between C CDs vs. CMOS
sensors one thing to note is of course
as we talked about before there are
these bare patterns but then beneath the
bare patterns are these photo diodes we
can refer to all of them as basically
photo sites this is where of course
information is captured and converted
into light intensities and colors so
these regions are the photo sites for
either one of them basically any of
these regions is a photo site and we
want to be able to capture information
from these photo sites so the big
difference is the photo sites in a CCD
are passive and actually do no work
whatsoever as soon as something is
captured information is then moved over
and there is an amplifier that's used to
kind of take the exact values and
amplify to a scale that can be measured
by the storage device that comes in so
I'm just showing an example of how
things are copied over one row at a time
and then saved photo sites and CMOS
actually have an amplifier right there
and actually they can do local
processing so the readout at each and
every one of them is local as opposed to
I in this case not really global but
actually it's done after all of things
have been stored here every readout is
done at the local sensor itself so in
essence there is a small local amplifier
each and every one of the photo sites so
each and every point here every photo
site has its own amplifier so of course
that allows them to do local processing
one thing to note here is this is one of
the traditional problems if you play
around with video on your cell handheld
camera or a cell phone cam
you see something called a rolling
shutter artifact well actually in one of
the applications talk about how we can
get a rolling shutter is something which
we've done a lot of research on but
basically one of the reasons for rolling
shutter is because of the readout that's
happening at each and every photo site
if the camera is moving faster than the
readout is you will see some sort of
rolling artifacts some non rigidity in a
scene or some bending of the scene that
is just because when this thing is read
then by the time this is read the scene
may have changed and that is an artifact
that's common in specially lower-end
CMOS sensors higher end ones have a much
faster readout rate and can do much
better</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
