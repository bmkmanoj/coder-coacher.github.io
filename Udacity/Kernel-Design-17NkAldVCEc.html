computing base what it has to do the
fact that it has to be small but it has
to be sort of the kernel or be at the
center of everything is in it we talked
about you know it should do complete
mediation you have to go through it to
get to physical hardware resources or we
shouldn't be able to bypass it so that
means you know this is something you
always go through and this is at the
harder core of any system that we have
so the kernel is is that core the
innermost most trusted hopefully
something that you can trust for things
to be right and this kernel is where the
the security mechanisms have to be
enforced so the security kernel is sort
of at the center of the core it has to
enforce anything to do with security the
fact that although it's at the center
and small it's just the kernel and it's
it's not everything that our blob
hopefully that helps with good isolation
small size is good for verifiability so
kernel design basically says you know
look for the smallest possible system
where you can put your security
mechanisms the reference monitor that
controls access to objects where all
references are monitored enforcement all
security mechanisms access to protected
objects or resources one of those two
the reference monitor function of course
has to be one that the security kernel
has to address and the security colonel
since
good isolation actually it becomes the
core of the trusted computing base or
the trusted computing base so it has to
be tamper proof you shouldn't be able to
bypass it always gets in the way it's
always invoked that's our complete
mediation function or reference monitor
that has to do check every reference and
going back to the small size we had
before we want the small size is going
to help us able to analyze it and
understand it and make sure that it does
enforce or or implement the security
mechanisms that we need and those
implementations are correct so the idea
here is that trusted computing base one
approach is the security kernel approach
where do you bring the security relevant
functions together and that goes at the
core of the system that you're trying to
build</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
