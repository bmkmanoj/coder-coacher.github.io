we start out in position I within the
row and we're going to define s to be
the starting position of any prefix to
the left we say while there's a letter
just to the left of us by one decrement
s by 1 s minus equals 1 is the same as
saying s equals s minus 1 if they're any
letters then s is going to be changed if
s was changed if it's less than I then
there is a prefix on the board so we
return those letters combined into a
single word like be the value of the
size of those which is I minus s which
is two in that case or if there are no
letters already on the board to the left
of the anchor then what we want to do is
say how many squares are there that have
empty squares but squares that are not
anchors because remember we agreed that
a prefix wouldn't span over an anchor
because we don't want to have duplicates
we only want empty squares that are not
anchors keep going backwards keep
decrementing s while that's true and
then return no there are no letters on
the board to the left of me this is the
number of empty squares that I found and
in this definition I introduced these
predicates is letter and is empty
they're pretty straightforward empty
square is one which is the empty
character also can be there's one
character on the board that I'm going to
mark with an asterisk that's the
starting location that's usually in the
middle of the board for anchors are also
empty and I have to check specifically
here if I want an empty thing that's not
an anchor and what's a letter a letter
is a string that's one of the allowable
letters Wow so that was a lot I think
it's time to put it some tests to make
sure that all the code we wrote is doing
the right thing so I wrote one test here
the legal prefix for location number two
within the row should be just the letter
A so that make sense here's position two
to the left of that is the prefix a we
don't want to go further and go into the
border and what I want you to do is just
fill in the rest of these tests put in
the proper values for this and all these
others of what legal prefix should
return and you should do that by looking
at this example here and figure
bring out what makes sense to you for
what the legal prefixes should be you
can also look at this definition of a
row and make sure that we got that right
and then go ahead and fill these in</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
