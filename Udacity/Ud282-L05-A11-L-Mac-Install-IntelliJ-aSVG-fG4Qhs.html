and written a few lines of code so you
can see what it looks like you can see
that it has some built-in tools that
help you organize programs and functions
and it does color text highlighting so
that you can easily distinguish between
types of variables and certain words
that Java recognizes it also helps you
remember code syntax and functions with
built-in code completion and we'll be
using this application for the rest of
this class to download IntelliJ you can
either search for its download link or I
recommend just clicking on the link
provided in the notes below so here's
what the download site looks like as of
May nineteenth 2016 again software
changes all the time so I recommend
looking at the text instructions after
this node to get the most up-to-date
information about downloading IntelliJ
you should see this page with download
options for Mac OS X Windows and Linux
so make sure you have this mac OS x
version selected and will be downloading
the free community version of IntelliJ
so click on this download button that
will take you to this page and your
computer will start downloading IntelliJ
this is a pretty big file so it might
take a few minutes depending on how fast
your computer is after this download
finishes click on it to start the
installation after you've clicked you
should see this window pop up with
instructions to drag IntelliJ into your
Applications folder this will add it to
the applications that your computer can
use and this will take a few seconds
after that's done click on it to open it
up and see how to write Java programs
you might get a warning message saying
you've downloaded it from the internet
are you sure you want to open it and
just say yes open
next I'll walk you through the IntelliJ
environment and show you how easy it is
to create a HelloWorld program</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
