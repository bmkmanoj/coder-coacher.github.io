efficient as otherwise no one will use
it the runtime does not actually write
the persistent data that is specified
through the set range call directly to
the external data segments instead it
writes the changes that it made to the
block of addresses specified by the set
range call as a redo log in a log
segment that was named in the
initialized call and we know that the
log segment is the trick that we
mentioned earlier also to avoid random
writes to the disk the log segment is an
in-memory data structure of the rvm
runtime and once a transaction commits
at that point the log segment that
contains the changes that have been made
to the in-memory version of persistent
data structures will be committed to the
disk or in other words our VM writes the
changes that the developers making to
persistent data structures in-between
begin and end transaction as redo logs
in the log segment and these legal log
that has been written to the log segment
is committed to the disk at the point of
entrance action on the other hand if the
transaction avoids then you don't have
to commit those redo logs to the disk
now remember that the changes that have
been made to the persistent data
structures the in-memory versions of
those persistent data structures have to
be eventually committed to the external
data segments now that part is done
lazily by the rvm system it basically
applies the redo logs that have been
committed to the disk to the external
data segments at opportune moments and
once it is applied those redo logs from
the log segment into the external data
segments the redo logs can be thrown
away and this part is what is called
truncation so there are two parts to
managing the log one is at the point of
commitment the log has to be forced to
the disk because you want to persist it
and second once it has been committed to
the disk you have to eventually apply it
to the external data segments at that
point you can truncate the log so long
is going to be applied to the external
data segments and once those accelerated
segments have been modified then you can
throw away those redo logs so flushing
the log segments to the disk as well as
truncating the log segments once they
have been applied to the external data
segments that they represent are all
done automatically by lr vm so the
application developer doesn't have to do
anything other than initialize his
virtual memory the log segments he wants
to use and write the code that contains
these critical sections bound by begin
transaction and end transaction or a
board transaction but our VM also
provides flush and truncate as
primitives for flexibility in writing
the application or in other words the
application can if it chooses explicitly
manage the persistence and application
of the redo logs to the data segments
shortly we will mention some
optimizations specified through the
commit mode to the RVM library by the
application programmer to enhance
performance one of those optimization
features allows the rvm to defer
flushing to the disk at the point of
commit so one of those optimization
features in the commitment is to tell
the rvm do not flush the changes to the
log segment of the commit point yet I'll
take care of it explicitly by flushing
so these additional primitives are for
the developers if she so chooses to
explicitly controlling flushing of the
logs to the disk and also manage the
truncation of the logs by explicitly
applying it when she wants it to the
external data segments to conserve space
because if you think about it all these
log segments are occupying space on the
disc at the commit point you're flushing
the redo records in the log segments to
the disk and so you're filling up the
disk with a lot of redo records in
addition to the external data segments
the truncation is a way by which the
subsystem designer can explicitly say go
ahead and
apply these e 2 logs to the external
data segments and truncate the log so as
I said these calls are there purely for
flexibility if the designer so chooses
to use these primitives for explicitly
controlling and reducing the log space
and these additional primitives are
available in our VM as a way by which
the developer can administer the design
of a subsystem and performance tune his
subsystem for optimality the main thing
to take away is that the rvm design is
simple with a small set of primitives
easy to grok for a developer and use in
the design of a subsystem also we've
been using the word transaction but the
semantics of the transaction as used in
our VM is much more restricted compared
to the traditional use of the word
transaction in the database literature
in particular the transaction as
proposed and used in the RVM library is
intended for recovery management it does
not need all the properties that are
usually associated with traditional
transaction so-called acid properties
namely atomicity consistency isolation
and durability for example the
transaction as defined an RV m does not
allow for nested transactions it has no
support for concurrency control so all
of these are things that you normally
associate a transaction but the key
design objective in our VM is to make it
simple and performant and easy to use
and if there is need for concurrency
control it is something that the
developer has to implement at a higher
level in their system software so in
this sense it is useful to remember what
I said earlier that the code that exists
between begin transaction and end
transaction is like a critical section
in the application code and all that the
developer is trying to signal through
that critical section to the RVM library
is that it is making changes to a
portion of an address range and that
portion of the address range it needs to
be
persisted if in fact that critical
section bound by this end transaction
commits on the other hand if the
critical section aborts then those
changes should be thrown away that's the
intent of the set of primitives provided
by our VM and that's the intent of this
transaction semantics</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
