define the customer persona or archetype
which is just a fancy way for saying I
want you to know everything about those
customers so what could be everything so
at the end of the day not only do you
know about the pains and gains of these
customers but you specifically know who
they are they're if they're in a company
their position and title their age their
sex their role and consumers could be
parents it could be child for a consumer
could be housemaid etc how do they buy
where do they buy how much money do they
have discretionary to spend and again
it's true in companies and it's Willet
true for consumers and companies do you
know how much each individual department
can sign up for that is if you've priced
your product a dollar too high sometimes
it requires the next level of management
to sign off same at home if you're
trying to sell to kids do you know what
their allowances are and how much you
where they get their money and how often
they get it and if you're selling to
consumers who are parents what's their
weekly spend on discretionary items you
need to understand what matters to them
what motivates them who influences them
and this one isn't trivial the
influences them you're going to go back
to this when you do customer
relationships later and it'd be great if
you actually knew how to reach these
people and what buttons to push when you
do and so if you start asking these
questions when you're starting to talk
to them trying to define them it makes
spending for marketing and demand
creation that is for customer
acquisition and activation incredibly
easy because you already asked them
upfront how would I get you to buy this
so marketing doesn't become some
mysterious process later on customers
already told you oh this is how I buy
and this is how much I spend and here's
who I listen to when I want to make a
purchase as I said earlier to me the
goal is actually for you to know enough
to confidently go up to a whiteboard and
draw the day in the life of a customer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
