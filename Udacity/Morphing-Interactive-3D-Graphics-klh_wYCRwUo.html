one model to another it's a fairly
tricky problem to solve if the two
objects are quite different for example
if I want to morph a cube into a unicorn
model I'll have to create a bunch of
vertices on the cube and decide how
these move in a convincing way much
simpler is to interpolate between two
meshes with the same number of vertices
in this case linear interpolation
between the two meshes is trivial a more
general approach uses what are called
morph targets or key poses a simple
example is a smile say we have three
poses a neutral pose a smile and a frown
to go from one to the other we can
interpolate essentially the key poses
are similar to key frames to interpolate
between by changing the amount of
influence a particular target has
affects the result for example I could
specify a half smile by saying to have
each vertex be half the neutral pose
half the smile pose a further advantage
of morph targets is that they can be
combined for example I could have key
poses for an eyebrow and use it as I
wish with a smile or frown a post can be
associated with parts of a mesh and so
influenced only them for example here
I'm using the wonderful ginger demo by
stickman ventures there are sliders set
on many different facial features by
changing a setting I'm changing the
influence of the morph target even
skinned models can be exported and
treated as morph targets morph targets
are well supported by 3GS and so are
popular way to display animated models
the main drawback on the modeling end is
that it's labor-intensive to create
morph targets the whole process of
setting up a character's animation
controls is called rigging and one that
takes skill and time to do properly such
processes are almost always done with
interactive modeling and animation
programs another drawback is that
morphing needs much more data than
skinning while running an animation both
to download and to keep in the GPUs
memory all that said morphing has the
advantage of being generic any model
changes can be saved into morph targets
and there's no real ambiguity skinning
cannon is done in a myriad different
ways with research continuing to find
new techniques lots of tears have been
shed by many developers trying to
convert skinning animations from one
format to another</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
