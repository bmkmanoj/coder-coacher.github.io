YouTube let me just show that now and it
explains how this works I'm actually
going to cut out the section when starts
talking about rabbits but that's because
you guys already understand how stereo
works Microsoft's Kinect has a depth
sensor that can tell how far away things
are in this stream brighter colors are
closer and darker ones are farther away
this video will explain how it does this
which is pretty clever and not how many
people initially thought it worked
by the way these things are relatively
easy to implement you could implement
these things to just connect up to
connect you can use just write a little
program or even in MATLAB you can do it
directly and display it and it's kind of
cool to experiment with the thing that I
like about this video that you can see
well is he he sets it up so you can look
at this in a dark room using a ir
sensitive camera which by the way most
digital cameras are i are sensitive so
if you do this you probably look at this
on the video feed coming off of your
digital camera while you've illuminated
things with the kinect and you and
you'll see it now if you take a night
vision camera and look at the projection
from the kinect you won't see a grid of
numbers but rather a random speckle
pattern this accomplishes the same goal
though because no group of specs looks
like any other so the connect
automatically knows the angle of every
group and can therefore triangulate
distances just like shown before the
downside of this technology is that it
can only work indoors because sunlight
would wash out the speckle pattern and
similarly multiple connects would
confuse each other</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
