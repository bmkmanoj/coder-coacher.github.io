is the use of reinforcement to shape and
change behavior however other techniques
are used such as extinction and this was
used in the study I just talked about
with the psychiatric nurse as a
behavioral engineer they used extinction
to decrease symptoms of schizophrenia
but let's look at a different type of
therapy that's used as reinforcement one
successful ABA technique that is used by
behavioral therapists is a token economy
and here desire behaviors are reinforced
with a token that can be something like
a sticker a star on the board or some
type of chip these tokens are
accumulated and can later be exchanged
for other items or privileges for
example a child with ADHD may be put on
a token economy wherein he gets a token
for every homework assignment that he
completes on time after he accumulates
five stars he gets ten extra minutes of
recess moreover if he earns ten stars he
gets to go on the field trip with the
class the token economy technique has
been found to be especially effective in
treating drug addiction so let's look at
an example of that
Steven Higgins and his colleagues
conducted a series of studies where they
gave cocaine dependent participants
tokens for each drug-free urine sample
that they provided in some of the
studies the value of the tokens
increased for each consecutive drug-free
sample so for example perhaps the first
token was worth 25 cents if they
provided a drug-free urine on the next
day it would be increased to 50 cents on
the third day if they provided a
drug-free sample it would go to 75 cents
now remember these were just tokens they
didn't earn actual money and part of
this was because they wanted to make
sure that the tokens could be exchanged
for appropriate items meaning they
didn't want to give these individuals
money and then perhaps risk them taking
that money and going out and buying
drugs
so again if drugs were found in the
urine the value of the token decreased
to the original starting value so again
if they had consecutive drug-free urines
the token value increased each time
but if drugs were found in the urine it
went back to the original starting value
in these studies the researchers found a
significant decrease in drug using
especially compared to other therapies
such as Narcotics Anonymous these
individuals spent longer time drug free
than individuals in those other
treatments given the success of these
types of studies this behavioral
approach has been listed by the National
Institute on Drug Abuse
as the best option for drug addiction
along with medication</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
