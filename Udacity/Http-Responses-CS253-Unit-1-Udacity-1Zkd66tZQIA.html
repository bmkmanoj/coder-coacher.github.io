talk a little bit about HTTP responses
let's talk about where we are first
you've got you and your machine and
you've got these servers your browser
makes a request to the servers and your
server sends back the response we talked
about the requests already and the
server responds with a response the
document that you requested or you know
information about the document depending
on what you requested a basic HTTP
response looks actually very similar to
the request for basically request that
looks like this the response might look
something like this okay so we can see a
couple easy things first of all the stat
this is called the status line and this
is analogous to the request line we had
over here now the version of the status
line matches the version of the request
line and then it's followed by two other
pieces of information one is the status
code and the other is the reason phrase
and this is just an english-language
description of the status code there are
some really common status codes and I'll
show you some of them here 200 okay that
means the document is found this is a
far and away the most common status code
on the internet and hopefully we'll be
seeing a lot of these 302 found that
means the document is located somewhere
else 404 not found you've probably seen
this one a lot this means the document
wasn't found and 500 server error that
means the server broke trying to handle
your request unfortunately we will
probably also be seeing a fair number of
these and our adventures in this course
status codes basically begin with one
two three four or five if it begins with
the two basically means success if it
begins with a three it basically means
we need to do something different
technically to find this document for
means there's an error on the browser
side requesting a document that doesn't
exist for example and five means there's
an error on the server side such as the
server is broken okay let's let's move
on a little bit and talk a little bit
more about responses</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
