individual array elements with arrays
you don't call a method to get at an
element remember with an ArrayList we
would have called dot get but with an
array you used the brackets and you put
the index inside the values bracket 0 is
the equivalent of calling values get 0
for an array you used the brackets for
an ArrayList you use a method you use
the same notation if you want to store
something into an array so here values
bracket 0 equals 42 means put the number
42 into the 0 slot off this array that's
a little simpler than with array lists
where we would have had to call dot set
of 0 42 how can we look at all of the
elements of an array it's very similar
eyes with array lists here we have a for
loop we want to look at values bracket I
and I goes from 0 to 1 less than the
length of the array with an ArrayList we
would have called dot size note that the
length does not have parenthesis that's
just an oddity for historical reasons we
simply looked at all of the elements in
the array and as with an ArrayList we
can use an enhanced for-loop to make
this a little simpler here is the
equivalent enhanced for loop over here
is our array we want value to assume
each of the elements in turn and then we
use it note that with the enhanced for
loop you can't tell any difference
between an array and an ArrayList
you put the array our ArrayList to the
right of the cola and the variable to
the left of the colon gets assigned each
element in turn</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
