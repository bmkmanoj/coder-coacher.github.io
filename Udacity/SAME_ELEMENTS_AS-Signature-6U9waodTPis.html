our specification for sort was all about
now let's look at the second part which
had to do with whether the elements were
the same in the output as they were in
the input so we're going to begin the
same way we did before and I like you
Jerryd see if you can state in English
what it means for two vectors x and y to
have the same elements and we're going
to call this function that we're
defining same elements as okay do we
need to start by writing a signature and
in this whole process that that's that's
the the process yes so for this function
we will take two vectors a vector X Oh
before I forget go ahead okay finish
what you got alright I've noticed the
flaw but we will be taking two vectors
will take a vector X and a vector Y and
a comparison will happen we can assume
and it will return a boolean value
representing whether they have the same
elements or not and what did you what
did you label your bullying result as Y
which is the same we've already assigned
that okay so them obviously this is
actually a legitimate signature but it's
well I shouldn't say it's legitimate
syntactically correct signature but it's
not meaningful because we're using the
same value the same letter in two
different places so as I said before the
actual letter that we use doesn't make
any difference as long as we're
consistently use it so we could say here
bool why we could say bull Z as long as
it's different than those input names
that we used</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
