work and the reason it doesn't work is
well this message encrypting R with a
key that's exactly what the server sent
so this certainly doesn't prove
knowledge of K because this could just
be reflected back to the server so we
need to do something a little different
instead of encrypting just R we need to
encrypt something else it proves
knowledge of K and R but couldn't be
generated just by replaying this and so
one way to do that would be to add
another nonce we're going to concatenate
a new nonce here and encrypt and
concatenation of those two now the
server can decrypt this extract R check
that it matches and extract that value
and the server could send that value
back encrypted with K at this stage both
the server and the client have proved
knowledge of the password they've
established a shared secret that they
can use for further communication and
they've done this in a way so that even
if there's an active attacker
intercepting and modifying all these
messages if the tacker doesn't know the
password P they can't trick the client
and server into believing that they're
talking with each other or establishing
a key that's different from the one that
they would establish</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
