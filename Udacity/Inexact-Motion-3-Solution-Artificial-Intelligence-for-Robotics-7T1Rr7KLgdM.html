0.2 everywhere and the reason is with
every grid cell being equally likely
applying this motion model will still
make each grid cell equally likely so
let's pick one of them say this one over
here we could have arrived here in three
different ways
perhaps we started the next two in our
motion when well this gives us a zero
point two times the zero point eight
perhaps we started the next one and we
overshot which gives us a zero point two
for the cell x one times zero point one
four over shooting or perhaps we started
the next three in the under shot which
is 0.2 times zero point one when we add
those up then we find that it's the same
as zero point two times one because the
factors over here add up exactly to one
which makes zero point two and the
result is zero point two you can apply
the same logic to all the other cells
this guy over here could have come from
this guy this guy this guy where this
one is weighted with 0.8 and the other
two with 0.1 that's called a convolution
and as we see later there's a very nice
way to write this mathematically as
something called theorem of total
probability but for the time being I'd
like to program this in</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
