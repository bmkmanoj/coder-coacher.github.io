you're really able to start doing
high-level text analysis right away but
I want you to think about something else
when you're doing text analysis as well
and that is that when it comes to a
vocabulary not all words are equal
another way to think about this is that
some words contain more information than
others and in order to get you thinking
about this what I'm going to do is give
you a quiz I'm gonna give you a set of
words and I want you to check the words
that are low information you don't
technically know what this means yet but
just think about your intuition which
words do you think are giving you
information about what's going on in the
text and what words just aren't that
helpful to help you understand what's
going on
let's suppose that our corpus is the
same sort of standard set of messages
that we've been looking at so far so our
vocabulary contains the words hi Kati
Sebastian will the driving machine
learning and great obviously all of
these words show up in the messages at
least once I check the ones that you
think aren't really telling you that
much about what might be going on in the
message</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
