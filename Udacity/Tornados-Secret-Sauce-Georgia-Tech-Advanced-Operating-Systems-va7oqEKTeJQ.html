achieving the scalability is the concept
called clustered object the idea is that
from the point of view of all the pieces
of the operating system executing on the
different nodes there is a single object
reference that an object reference is
the same but the object reference under
the covers may have multiple
representations so for instance n0 may
have a representation that is looking at
different from n1 different from n2 but
the object reference is the same so
there's an illusion of a single object
so that's what I meant when I said
logically the operating system designer
may think of a shared data structure as
logically the same thing but physically
it may be replicated under the covers of
course who decides to replicate it
that's the decision of the operating
system as well we'll see that in a
minute this is where the idea of
clustering comes about the knee the name
clustered object the degree of
clustering that is the replication of a
particular object it's an implementation
choice of the service so as the designer
of the service you make a decision
whether a particular object is going to
have a singleton representation or it is
going to be one per core in the entire
machine or one per CPU meaning it is
shared by all the cores that may be
there on a single CPU or may be one
representation of an object for a group
of processors so these are all design
decisions that is left up to the
implementer of the service but when
designing the service you can think
abstractly about the components of the
service containing objects and each
object is giving you the illusion that
it is a single object reference but
under the covers you might choose to
implement the object with different
levels of replication and of course if
we are talking about replicated objects
you have to worry about the consistency
of the replicated objects and this is
where the suggestion in the tornado a
system is to maintain the consistency of
the objects through protected procedure
call that is implemented under the
covers
in the operating system so in other
words as the designer of the service you
are going to orchestrate the sharing of
the data structures that are replicated
and you orchestrate maintenance of the
consistency of the shared data
structures through protected procedure
call that you execute across these
replicas and hone use the hardware
coherence mechanism in order to maintain
the consistency and the reason for that
is the hardware cache coherence it can
be indiscriminate about how it does the
hardware cache coherence whenever you
touch the shared memory location if it
is present elsewhere it is going to
update that and that's the reason that
we don't want to incur the overhead of
the hardware cache coherence and
replicated but if you replicate it then
the hardware doesn't know about it and
therefore you have to worry about
keeping these copies consistent with one
another but of course when in doubt use
a single representation and that way you
have the hardware cache coherence as a
security blanket when you're not sure
yet about the level of clustering that
you want in order to reduce the amount
of contention for shared data structures
all of these may see a little bit of
abstract at this point of time but I'll
make it very concrete when we talk about
a simple example namely the memory
management subsystem</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
