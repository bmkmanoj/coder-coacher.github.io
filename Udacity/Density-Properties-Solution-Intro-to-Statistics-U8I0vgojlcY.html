clearly density is don't have to be
positive everywhere it suffices to be
non-negative and I gave you examples
where outside a certain interval then
zero zero zero is not positive zero it's
just non-negative
now densities don't have to be
continuous I gave an example of a
density like this and over here where
the density jumps you're the point of
discontinuity so continuous is not
correct and if you got this wrong no big
deal the world continues matter even
mean much to you but it's one of these
things to know about densities now small
or equal to one that's a really tricky
one and I would submit that's not
correct and here's why suppose you have
a density it assigns uniform probability
only two values between 0 and 0.1 then
the height of this density could be 10
it's 1 over the 0.1 and as a result it's
possible the densities can exceed 1 and
that is a key point that makes them
different probabilities probabilities
are always smaller than equal to 1
densities can be larger than 1</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
