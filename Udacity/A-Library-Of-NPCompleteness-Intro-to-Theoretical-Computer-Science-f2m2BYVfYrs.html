subjective and far from complete and
also maybe not always correct but
nevertheless I think clustering or
finding groups of related objects
usually it's a good idea to try to do a
reduction from clique covering a set of
objects that is basically the problem
that Alice was looking at for her
telecommunications company so vertex
cover is usually a good idea and there
are certain generalizations of vertex
cover called hitting set that can also
be a useful tool in proving that
problems like this are np-complete
optimizing pathways well yeah that is
shortest tour and also here you should
know that shortest tour has a very
closely related problem and that is the
famous Traveling Salesman problem they
are not the same but they are very very
close travelling salesman is basically
shortest tour but you cannot visit a
vertex more than once
so it's enforced here and traveling
salesman or the shortest tour problem
here it is always a good idea to try to
use these problems for a reduction when
you want to show that a problem that
deals with optimizing pathways under
constraints is np-complete now
diversification independent objects yeah
if your bid tests a V you would already
have guessed this is of course
independent set and then finally
something else well you use our general
tool and that is Sat</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
