is from kisses from me heaven from
Oregon he is a high school math teacher
nice cool and a cross-country skier Wow
okay he is a pretty interesting question
and he's asking there has been talk
within the press and the media about
programming and knowledge of programming
becoming a third required widow sea of
education so at least in the United
States is very common that you have kind
of verbal requirements learning how to
read and write and mathematics
requirements learn how to do algebra and
I guess he's asking do you feel that
programming could be that third section
that's kind of required and designed in
every curriculum everywhere um so I
think this is a really interesting
question hi his interest and I think
there's there's definitely a tremendous
value for students learning programming
early in school I think there's a lot of
things that in the traditional grade
school curriculum and I'm speaking about
the u.s. I don't know much about how
that works in other parts of the world
hopefully they're they're more
forward-thinking than America has been
but what's taught in the grade school is
pretty my and this actually goes through
high school is pretty much 1950s
curriculum that it really hasn't changed
and there's a lot of time spent on
learning how to do mechanical
calculations that students are basically
learning kind of algorithms for doing
division for solving complex problems by
following mechanical steps and they're
learning how to do this very carefully
and precisely the kinds of things that
computer should be doing and it would be
much better if students were learning
how to think about things
algorithmically how to think about how
to describe the way to solve problems
rather than following steps the way of
computer follows that and so I think
it's I'm probably not the one who knows
how to redesign our elementary school
curriculum although it's definitely a
good thing to think about I think there
are great ways to learn about math by
doing programming
and there's a projects that are seeking
to do that prom dealer I sorry I there's
there's also a project that started at
Northeastern doing this so I think
there's a lot of actually that started
at Brown but there I'm forgetting the
name of the now it was just hearing
about it earlier today from our field
trip to Mozilla but there are projects
that are doing things where the best way
to learn about physics are to learn
about math is really to build a
simulation yourself and that's true also
learning about lots of things in society
like elections or how people interact
with each other and if students sort of
learned about programming when they were
in school they would understand these
things much better than the kinds of I
think much more difficult ways of
understanding them as mathematical
models a lot of a lot of it is a
systematic way it's like yeah so I you
know I like the idea of thinking of it
as sort of a third branch of literacy
that everyone who wants to function well
in the world and understand how things
work really should understand
programming they don't have to be expert
it's programmers but at least enough to
be able to understand how things work is
there a age requirement for you Danity
um where are lawyers I hope writers
aren't watching my shows we have no age
of requirement um there are laws in the
US about if you collect and email
address from someone what age they can
be identifiable information and we are
happy to have all students in the closet
and students that are under whatever
legal age the US law I'd say content are
Creative Commons license so yes can
definitely take the class and we assume
anyone who tells us that their age is
below whatever the minimum legal age is
well my more just is can you be too old
can you can't be too old and I know we
definitely have 80 year olds in the
class I I hope we have a 19 year old I
had heard from one directly I've had a
conversation with the e 2 year old
that's okay it's not so we don't know
what a spot like um you know I think
it's great there's
so they look at retired people in class
I ate my mom is taking the class as well
as my dad I won't mention their ages but
it's under 82 so that's good let's see
does anyone have a question you wanna
ask verbally no okay um you get a
compliment okay I'm glad thank you I
hope people are enjoying it as much as
we here we're having great time to
and you know a lot of what makes the
class work is the contributions of
students as well so it's it's fittest
and that's very evident on the forms
that weird some of the stuff we see on
the forums we share around the office
and it's a pretty amazing what some of
our students do that's my shout out to
our students okay good how do you
programmers make a new programming
language okay yes so how and why yeah do
people making why would you need a new
program language and and one of the
things that I may have mentioned it
remember that all praying languages are
exactly as powerful in terms of once you
have the things in and it did talk about
in unit 2 that once you know about if
and procedures and variables and
arithmetic you've got enough to write
every possible program and so every
programming language is equally powerful
they can all right the same exact set of
all possible programs in a theory class
that's explained more precisely what
that means but once you have those those
few basic things that's really enough to
build everything else so that raises a
good question of why are there thousands
of programming languages and there are
thousands and their people making up new
proving languages all the time and there
are lots of different reasons to make a
new language sometimes it's just for fun
and it's definitely something you learn
a lot from and I think those of you who
take the program languages class next
we'll get a sense for how easy it is to
change what a language means and how
interesting it is to do that there are
drug joke languages is too there are ya
I was created just to be funny yeah and
and so that's one reason the more
serious reasons to create
your language that all of language
design is really a trade off and you're
trading on things you're trading off how
easy it is to write programs with how
fast your programs can run and we've
chosen to teach 101 a language club
that's Python that's designed we're
making it easy to write programs is more
important than making the program's run
fast there are other languages and if
you're writing code for say controlling
the fighter jet how fast it takes to
make decisions is more important than
how easy it is for the code to write you
can spend millions of dollars getting
the code written you hope it's correct
but performance is much more important
so that's one tray off another trade-off
is between how expressive the languages
and how easy it is to write something
that doesn't mean what you want it to me
and python is is quite an expressive
language it's easy to write things in
Python that seem correct but don't mean
exactly what you wanted them to me there
are other language that try much harder
to make it so if you write code and the
code runs it's more likely to mean
exactly what you thought it meant and
those languages do things that make it
harder to accidentally write a program
need something different so there are
lots of different programming languages
and they're you know both reasons of
style and taste but they're also some
good engineering reasons why we need
many different programming languages
feel free to ask a question until then
we're gonna just sit through the palms
do we hit the how you would I yo his off
oh I don't have audio on sorry someone
was talking he's repeat the question I
gotta get better at that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
