American History which is just a bigger
map bigger thing we do the same thing
one thing I'll show you here is that
here the map is a little bit bigger and
in fact if you take a look at this map
it was actually created by a robot doing
what's called slam where we actually use
the robot to build the map so here we
have again the robot doesn't know where
it is it takes a bunch of measurements
these are where the actual measurements
are the robot doesn't know that yet and
this is the set of particles that
survive so you see it's clumped up a
little but it doesn't know so it moves
takes another set of measurements and
these are the particles to survive now
with just two sets of measurements
almost everything else here has gone
away and we're getting a bigger clump
there just two sets of those
measurements right propagate forward
take a measurement and now you can see
is its advance forward it has pretty
much very little ambiguity left so again
just by taking these simple measurements
it knows where it is</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
