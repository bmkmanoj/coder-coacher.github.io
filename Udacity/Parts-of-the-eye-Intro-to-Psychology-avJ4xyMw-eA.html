eye what do they do well there's a lot
going on here so let's talk about it
right here we have this clear protective
membrane and that's called the cornea
and the eye is pretty important so it's
job is basically just to protect
everything that's going on inside how
about the blue part here well that's the
colored part of our eye that's called
the iris and in addition to being very
pretty it's a muscle that constricts or
dilates to change the amount of light
that's let in through this guy here and
that's called the pupil and when it's
dim you'll notice that your pupils tend
to be pretty big versus when it's bright
out they tend to be pretty small because
they don't need as much light then what
about this guy right here right that's
the lens remember how before we were
talking about how the light gets bent
when it enters the eye
yeah well the lens is what does that
bending that focusing to make sure that
the light enters and is focused onto the
back of the retina and when it hits the
retina that's where our rods and cones
are right yeah exactly those rods and
cones are called photoreceptor cells and
so this retina actually contains many
layers of these rods and cones and so
rods photoreceptor cells photo means
light receptor means to receive they
actually are sensitive to primarily
black and white vision and they help us
see at night time so then designing the
cones help us see color exactly and
there's actually three different types
of cones some are sensitive to red light
which is a long wavelength some are
sensitive to green or medium wavelength
light and some are sensitive to blue
short wavelength light so these are used
for color vision</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
