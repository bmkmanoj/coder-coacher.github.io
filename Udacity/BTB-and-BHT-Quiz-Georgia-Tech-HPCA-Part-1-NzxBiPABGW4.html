BHT work together let's do a BTB and BHT
quiz on that suppose we have the
following program this is the address of
the instruction this is the instruction
itself and these are the labels for
branches so what this program is doing
is it's moving 100 into R - it's moving
0 into R 1 and then as long as R 1 and R
2 are different it's gonna continue here
once R 1 and R 2 are the same it's going
to jump to the done label and exit this
loop in the loop it's adding R 1 to R 3
to form our for uses that to load a
value from that address and then adds
that r4 to R 5 adds 1 to R 1 and then
unconditionally branches back to this
loop so this is the loop this is where
we exit from the loop and this is the
sort of initialization for the loop
suppose that we have a branch history
table that has only 16 entries and makes
perfect predictions about branches
suppose we also have a BTB with 4
entries also makes perfect predictions
and as you can see all instructions are
4 bytes in size and we know that so the
question for you is how many times do we
access the BHT for each instruction
right here how many times we access the
BHT with this address because we are
fetching this instruction here how many
times we access the BHT with this
address because we are fetching this
instruction and so on there are eight
instructions here for each one of them
we need to say how many times we access
the BHT</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
