wikipedia that does the same thing and
i'm not going to go through the logic
here but what you can see is it's quite
a bit more idiomatic Python it's
actually quite a bit nicer than the code
that I wrote so if you like that better
then use this as a model instead of the
code that I wrote the code I wrote is
pretty kind of dumb and obvious so we
have equivalent leal on valid check so
i'm using the wikipedia algorithm which
just does the obvious thing and now what
I have here is a random tester which
generates a random credit card number
with a certain prefix and 15 digits and
then assure is that it ensures that it's
valid the validity checking function for
credit card numbers simply make sure
that it has the right length that it has
the right prefix and that the checksum
comes out to be 0 that is to say the
Islam valid function returns true so
that's all there is to it and what I
want to do finally is take a look at one
other issue so I'm going to comment out
my code here and comment in some
different code and so we're doing here
is generating completely random 15 digit
numbers so what I'm doing is generating
a random integer between 0 and the
smallest 16-digit number so the largest
number that could be generated here is
the largest 15 digit number and we're
going to zero fill convert that to a
string and do a zero fill operation
which adds leading zeros so now we have
a completely random over that's 15
digits long and if that checks out to be
a valid credit card number we're going
to increment or validity checker and
then finally after doing this 100,000
times we're going to print the number of
valid credit card numbers that we got so
let's run this and see what happens ok
we got no valid credit card numbers out
of 100,000 so the problem is the prefix
was too long with a six digit prefix the
chance is one in a million that will
generate just as prefix and then it goes
down to about one and ten million that
will meet the prefix and the checksum
requirement so if we start off with a
much smaller prefix like just 37 this is
basically anything in the American
Express system I think now let's see
what happens we're going to generate a
hundred thousand credit card numbers 104
of them came out to be came out to be
valid so even with just a two digit
prefix it's pretty unlikely that we
generate valid credit card numbers and
so what that means is if we're
generating lots of invalid credit card
numbers of course we're stressing only
the small very small bit of our
transaction processing logic the checks
for valid credit card numbers and we're
not stressing the rest of it so what I
hope I accomplished here is first of all
motivated the fact that this generation
of valid data is a real one and second
of all give you a little bit of a feel
for what code looks like that we usually
have to write to generate valid inputs
and so if we go back to our web browser
example you can see that we will be
doing a similar exercise but it'd just
be quite a bit more sophisticated to
generate for example valid HTML or valid
HTML with scripts and other things that
it would take to actually do meaningful
fuzzing of the web browser as shown by
the blue line here so now to do this
instead of spending half an hour or
however long you spent on that API quiz
now maybe you're going to be spending
many weeks but on the other hand what
we're going to get out of this if we do
it right there's a lot of high-value
bugs including security bugs in our web
browser and and strongly possible of
course not guaranteed to the value we
get out of those bugs that we find in
the web browser but our effort will have
been worth it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
