that DNA never leaves the nucleus it
never comes in direct contact with the
machinery necessary to build proteins
called ribosomes and as a solution in
this problem there's an intermediate
step that involves a chemical cousin of
DNA known as RNA so although DNA never
leaves the nucleus a copy is made and
this copy is composed of a very closely
related molecule called RNA it's kind of
like taking a big book of recipes or our
big genome book here and we're just
xeroxing a few pages that were
interested in that will help us make the
protein we need obviously we don't need
the whole genome to make one protein but
there are sequences of information that
are necessary to make up individual
proteins and we just want to make copies
of what we need and bring them out to
the cytoplasm to read this copying
process must happen for every protein
coding gene any gene is going to produce
a protein including the ABO gene so for
the ABO gene to be turned into protein
will first make a copy that will be
brought to the cytoplasm and then turned
into protein this basic process of
making copies of DNA bringing it to the
cytoplasm to make protein is so
important to almost all life forms on
our planet that we call it the central
dogma and the central dogma takes on a
very specific form in these three words
organized in a certain order they're
found up here I just want to see if you
can plug them into the boxes in the
right order blank to blank to blank is
the central dogma see if you can figure
out what belongs in each one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
