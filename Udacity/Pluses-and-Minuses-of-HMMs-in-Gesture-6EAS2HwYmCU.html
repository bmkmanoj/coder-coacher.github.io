terms of HMMs and gesture I'll say the
good things about it were it was a
learning paradigm right so you define
some features by the way you have to
define the right features you collect
some well annotated data which also
takes some work but given that you're
able to train your HMMs by just giving
it the data so it's a learning paradigm
and that's good the training is a little
bit slow it's not very slow but
recognition can be very fast because of
that recursive uh those recursive
algorithms we talked about running those
uh is uh very quick so so that works
really well you know of course not
everything is perfect they're not as
good for segmentation labeling as some
newer methods i mentioned conditional
random fields earlier if you actually
have something where your training data
has particular underlying states and you
know what those states are so it's not
even really a hidden Markov model it is
a Markov model but your training data
you know the underlying states and
you're seeing an observation and you
want that state sequence for that
segmentation there are now better
methods and I mentioned a condition
random fields you know in general this
stuff requires a reasonable amount of
data to Train one of the reasons was
used for speeches we had lots and lots
of lots of data although i will say that
HMMs may require less data than some of
these more discriminative methods and
then I put down something that I think
is tautological but also important to
know I said it works well when the
problem is easy we did a lot of work on
hmm gesture said or whatever and it's
very powerful for capturing regularities
when the regularities are quite clear
you have to do a lot more work on your
feature selection a bunch of other
things when those differences are a
little bit harder to to see number of
states and those kinds of things so um
you know that and that's probably true
of most classification methods when the
problem is easy they all work great it's
when the problem is not so easy that the
challenge comes in and that's when
people start reporting on small
differences um that means the real issue
and in choosing your classifier is to
understand where the complexity where
the difficulty your problem is
but in general people still use HMMs a
lot and they use it for describing
activity or time series and you know
it's in some sense your first line of
defense against activity recognition</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
