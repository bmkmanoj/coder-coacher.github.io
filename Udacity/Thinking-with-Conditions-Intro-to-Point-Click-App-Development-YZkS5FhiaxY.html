or what kind of report do you want to
make I really like those little needle
sort of you know the one that actually
shows up in your car dashboard and says
like oh you've spent this much and if
it's green you're really happy but that
would have to do with you know have you
made as much money as you're hoping for
so I think you're talking about an
odometer in your car yes and then what
you're talking about in Salesforce would
be a gauge chart okay let's make a gauge
chart with the needle yeah so in order
to do that for total revenue on the
entire festival we need to go down to
the attendee and create a formula field
first on how much each attendee spent
because we know how many tickets we have
or how many tickets they purchased and
we know how much a ticket costs remember
they also have different ticket prices
so like the VIP ticket will be like 100
bucks and I don't know
general admission 50 exactly and so
that's probably why a formula field
would make the most sense in order to
store that data around that conditional
use case okay so add a formula and
attendees to figure out how much money
each one spending yeah let's start out
with that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
