study electricity everyone was doing it
and the thing they were storing their
electricity in was known as a Leyden jar
now we don't need to go into the details
of how the star worked just yet but the
key thing to know is that through a
process which involve friction this jar
could become charged and for now let's
say that charged means the jar possesses
electricity in some way well once it was
charged the electrodes of this jar could
be connected to wires and by attaching
these wires to various objects you could
see things like sparks or you could even
start a fire now remember Benjamin
Franklin's idea was that lightning is
somehow the same thing is the
electricity that scientists have been
playing around with in these Leyden jars
so my question is which of the following
options would be the most convincing
demonstration to show that lightning is
actually the same thing as the
electricity in these Leyden jars would
we want to show that lightning like a
Leyden jar can actually somehow cause a
fire what do we want to show that we can
use lightning directly to charge a
Leyden jar what do we want to use
lightning to destroy a Leyden jar or or
do we want to see if lightning somehow
increases friction the thinking being
that Leyden jars were somehow charged by
a process that involve fiction which of
these four options should Benjamin
Franklin do if he wants to convincingly
prove that lightning is electricity</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
