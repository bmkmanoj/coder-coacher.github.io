right now called ASCII Chan and this is
going to be a message board for sharing
ASCII art it's going to have this
general structure where we will have a a
forum with you know it'll take a title
and some ASCII art we'll submit button
and the user can submit this and below
this forum they'll see you know ASCII
art that's been submitted by other
people things like that so it'll be a
one-page website it'll have a forum and
then the contents here so for those of
you who don't know what ASCII art is let
me give you a few examples here we are
on this website Chris calm pretty
awesome domain name this website is
dedicated to ASCII art and as you can
see here there I'm just looking at and
ask a bunch of ASCII art of cows you
know all ASCII art is it's just little
pictures drawn with you know keyboard
characters so pretty cool there's this
huge huge encyclopedia of ASCII art
online and we are going to build a forum
for people to share their own ASCII art
so anyway if you hadn't seen before
that's what it is it's a fantastic way
for people to waste time in front of
their keyboards okay here we go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
