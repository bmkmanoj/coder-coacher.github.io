back in 1997 I've been excited by the
potential of the Internet to teach 3d
graphics interactive 3d graphics with
speed and quality equal to that seen in
triple a title games and high-end CAD
packages is now possible on the web I'm
also thrilled that we can now share
programs in a straightforward way no
installs no compilation and anyone can
look at the code being run Udacity s
model is learn think do I find that
perfect for interactive rendering you
don't need to buy a DNA sequencer or
array of radio telescopes you have
everything you need at hand
experimentation is easy and quick with
3gs the only danger is the risk is
staying up till 4am saying what if I
twiddle with this parameter I ran across
a great quote from Confucius while
making this course every truth has four
corners as a teacher I can give you one
but you must provide the other three
this suits my view of computer graphics
you can be given a firm foundation but
you're the one who really needs to
pursue knowledge and learn by doing
Confucius probably meant something
different don't forget you have a giant
reference library at your fingertips
much what I found for these lessons
consisted of me typing in 3gs collision
detection and seeing what the search
engine popped up developing any sort of
interactive 3d graphics program was out
of reach of almost everyone 20 years ago
because back then graphics accelerators
cost the price of a luxury car now that
the price of a large pizza even up until
a few years ago creating a 3d
application involved compilers and
downloads and installs and once you were
done it would usually work on only one
operating system if you ran someone
else's glorious demo you were usually
left scratching your head how did they
do it the fact is you can now make a
wonderful interactive 3d graphics
program that anyone with a browser can
access with just a click and can read
the code that created it with just a few
more how amazing is that there's so much
you can do figure out what someone
else's code does write your own programs
write your own libraries even contribute
to 3gs itself and if you do document it
go off and do great things and whatever
you do send me the link</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
