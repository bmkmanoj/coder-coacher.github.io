pitch-perfect I want to cover a software
pattern that will be really useful in
your time as an iOS developer let me
introduce the MVC pattern to you we're
going to build a pitch-perfect app using
this pattern so knowing it will be
really handy to figure out where we are
and where we need to be the
model-view-controller pattern hails back
from the Mac development days of the 80s
it is still is useful today as it was
then you'll see it called Model View
controller or MVC for short we can think
of our pitch-perfect app as having three
parts the view which the user sees with
the buttons the model which is where we
store the recorded audio file and the
controller which we use to store and
retrieve data from the model and show it
in the view think of the data your app
contains for pitch-perfect this is just
an audio file but as you progress as an
iOS developer you will build ever more
complicated apps which we need to store
a lot more data all of the classes
involved with storing and maintaining
this data can be referred to as the
model on the other side of the diagram
we have the view the view is what the
user sees on screen and how to interact
with the app the view does not know
anything about the data itself or the
model as we call it here it only knows
how to display the subset of data that
it's given it is just you use your
interface in between them and in charge
of providing the view with data and the
model with any actions from the view is
the controller when the user action
happens on the view the controller is
notified if needed it updates the model
when the model is changed by some
external event and notifies the
controller which can update the view if
needed maybe you're thinking why not
just embed all of the model data code
inside the view what's often the case
that you need to have multiple different
views to show some parts of the same
data what would you do then copy and
pasting the code would quickly turn this
project into what one of my colleague
refers to you as copypasta great to eat
before about to have in your code having
a division in responsibility between the
model
the view and the controller in between
makes your code easy to maintain easy to
understand and reusable as we start
building pitch-perfect together you're
gonna see the model the view and the
controller parts and how they
communicate students have found it
really handy to have this pattern and
thought in the back of their minds as
they're developing for iOS it helps to
keep their app structured and easier to
develop</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
