about is JSON JSON that serves the same
purpose as XML which is it's a nice kind
of computer and human readable way to
exchange data in a consistent format it
stands for JavaScript object notation
the reason it says JavaScript is because
JSON is actually valid JavaScript code
it might look something like this you
know to use kind of our travel search
example from before we have kind of this
dictionary structure this actually looks
a lot like Python code because Python
and JavaScript have very similar syntax
for dictionaries and lists so we have
this dictionary might have a key called
itineraries whose value may be a list of
other dictionaries and in this case we
have a dictionary for each routing or
something like that or we have a
dictionary for each leg which may have
you know key for from and a key for -
and a value for each of those you know
this might be you know like one and this
might be like two and you can see you
know leg two is also made up of another
dictionary which is what we used the
curly braces for which has a couple key
value pairs of its own you know key
from' value IAD and key - value SCA and
then we can close our list we can close
this dictionary JSON is really handy for
expressing these types of objects you
can express anything you can express an
XML you can also express in JSON except
JSON is a little less verbose because
you don't need these kind of opening and
closing tags you can build things up out
of dictionaries or you know a mapping or
an object depending on what vocabulary
word you want to use hash table which is
just the curly and then a list of key
value pairs just like you would in
Python just like you would in JavaScript
you can also have lists which are used
brackets just like Python does and
separate the values in the list with
commas so we could have one two and the
string three so we can have both
integers and strings in our lists or in
the value of a hash table the list can
also be the value of a hash table a list
can also be an item in a list this could
look something like this
and so we've got a list inside a list
here with two more datatypes a boolean
which you're familiar with true or false
and a float and these are basically all
the data types we can have in JSON
int string boolean float we can of
course also have null which would be
inside for example the empty list
and our main data structures are
dictionaries or a mapping which is a key
to a value or multiple keys to
multiple values and lists so what I'd
like to show you now is how to parse
JSON in Python okay so we're in our
Python interpreter we can import JSON
which is now included in pythons version
2.6 and newer if you're using python 2.5
i suggest you try to find 2 6 or 2 7 but
I think App Engine uses 2 7 which is
what we've been using in this class so
you shouldn't have any problem importing
JSON if we were to make a JSON string in
Python here let's call it J so if we
were to take a string to representing
some JSON in this case it's basically a
dictionary with two keys 1 and numbers
and the value for 1 is 1 and the value
for numbers is the list 1 2 3 point five
that's parsed and JSON JSON we use the
function load S which basically stands
for load string there's also load but
that expects a file and in this case
we're going to be using just load s when
we run that we get back a Python
dictionary with our same keys numbers
and 1 you know the order doesn't matter
in Python dictionaries and our same
values 1 and 1 2 and 3 point 5 and so if
we were to store that in a variable D we
can manipulate it like this we could
look at D numbers when we get our list
we can like get D 1 and we can see our
number 1 there's actually because JSON
looks just like Python we could actually
evaluate and what a Valda's is actually
treats this as Python code as if I just
typed this at the prompt and this is the
result we get now that's a neat thing
you can do never ever do it because in
addition to having you know valid JSON
in here somebody could actually have
code that you know might do something to
your computer so never use a valve for
parsing JSON I just wanted to show that
you can use eval to parse JSON it's a
really convenient thing when you're
working in in Python with JSON the to
sync up very nicely</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
