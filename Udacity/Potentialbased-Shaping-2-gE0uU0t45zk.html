equation for Q prime and substituted in
the definitions that we think are true
what the new Q prime is in terms of the
old Q and what the new rewards are in
terms of the old rewards and so if this
works if we can do a bunch of if and
only if that actually bring us to
something that we know is true then we
should be good okay so all right how can
we we do have an equation for Q we don't
have an equation for Q minus sigh of s
but maybe we can cancel some things oh I
can see two things we can cancel all
right okay so the first side of this on
the left side of the equal sign yep that
matches up with the first side of s
right next to our yes right there yeah
because we're summing this overall next
dates all next s primes and this sums up
to 1 it's a convex combination right so
that means effectively you could take it
out doesn't depend on this prime anyway
and they go away good so now we got Q of
essay on one side and then you can you
can actually handle the next one if you
look at the next size s Prime the gamma
of sight of s prime well that matches
with the minus gamma of s prime inside
the max because that Max is multiplied
by gamma good right right right yeah so
it's interesting and this and the max
itself is not impacted by this quantity
because it doesn't depend on a prime
right it is in fact a concept so we can
actually take out this constant tujhe
turner and it actually cancels this one
and look what we're left with the
original equation tada we're left with
the original q equation which we know is
true and so this is true if and only if
the original thing is true this is an
actual solution to the Q equation the
bellman equation and so right that's
this is what happens to the Q function
it's the old Q function shifted down by
the potential function right and at no
point do we divide by zero so everything
is great right and how do we know that
we still have the same policy the same
optimal policy in which case so we know
we have some optimal policy for this Q
function this new Q function Q prime has
an optimal policy how do we know it's
the same well because it's just the
original Q function and you're just
being shifted around by a constant and
so that doesn't change the max and
therefore it doesn't change your optimal
policy exactly awesome all right so this
now gives
just three total different ways of
messing around with rewards to give us
new cue functions that don't actually
change the policy that's really nice so
I have a question sure you didn't write
anything down here about any
restrictions on the potential function
that's right does it have to be any
restrictions on the potential functions
may be potential restrictions
potentially I'm gonna say no because
it's all going to end up being okay and
cancelling out so so there's a sense in
which it actually you actually not
changed anything by throwing in one of
these additional potential functions but
maybe it can help us learn faster so
here's let's let's look at an example
where this might matter okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
