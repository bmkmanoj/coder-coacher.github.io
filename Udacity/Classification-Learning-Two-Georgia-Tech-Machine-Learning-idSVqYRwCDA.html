concept as functions or as mappings from
objects to membership in a set we have a
particular target concept and the only
difference between a target concept and
the general notion of concept is that
target the target concept is the thing
we're trying to find it's the actual
answer right so a function that
determines whether something is a car or
not or male or not is the target concept
now this is actually important right
because we could say that we have this
notion in our head of things that are
cars or things that are males or things
or people who are credit worthy but
unless we actually have it written down
somewhere we don't know whether it's
right or wrong so there is some target
concept we're trying to get of all the
concepts that might map pictures of
people to true and false okay so if
you're trying to teach me what tallness
is so you have this kind of concept in
mind of these these things are tall and
these things are not tall so you're
going to have to somehow convey that to
me so how are you going to teach me ah
so that's exactly the well that that's
what comes up with the rest of these
things that we're defining so let me let
me tell you what the next four things
are and then you can tell me whether
that answers your question how about
that okay so we've got a notion of
instances input we've got a notion of
concepts which take input and maps them
to some kind of output and we've got
there's some target concepts some
specific function some particular idea
that we're trying to find we're trying
to represent but out of what so that's
where the hypothesis comes in in fact I
think it's better to say hypothesis
class so that's the set of all concepts
that you're willing to entertain so it's
all the functions I'm willing to think
about so why wouldn't it just be all
possible functions it could be all
possible functions and that's a
perfectly reasonable hypothesis class
problem with that is that if it's all
possible functions it may be very very
hard for you to figure out which
function is the right one given finite
data so when we actually go over
decision trees next I think it'll be
kind of clear why you need to pick a
specific hypothesis class to think about
okay so let's let's return to that a
return that a little bit but it's an
excellent question
so
conceptually in the back of your head
until we come to specific examples you
can think of hypothesis classes simply
being all possible functions in the
world on the other hand even so far just
the classification learning we already
know that we're restricting ourselves to
a subset of all possible functions in
the world because all possible functions
in the world includes things like x
squared and that's regression and we've
already said we're not doing regression
we're doing classification so already
the hypothesis classes all functions we
care about and maybe it's all
classification functions so we've
already picked a subset so we've got all
these instances we've got all these
concepts we want to find a particular
concept and we've got the set of
functions that we're willing to look at
so how are we going to determine what
the right answer is so if we try to
answer Michaels question the way that we
do that in machine learning is with a
sample or another name for it which I
prefer is a training set</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
