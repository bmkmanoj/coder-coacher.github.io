in the computer science community but
what is an API and why is it so
important well ap is or application
programming interfaces refer to any
method of communication between two
entities of code you can think of api's
as connection points in code that allow
one application to talk to another when
you copy code from a browser and paste
it into a word processing application an
API inside your computer helped make
that transfer of data happen if you
listen to music on your computer like
with iTunes or Spotify the music playing
application communicated with your
operating systems API in order to send
that music to your speakers api's are a
great way for controlling the exposure
of code allowing internal
functionalities of an application to be
used from the outside world without
exposing all of the internal code
companies that want to keep their code
bases private like the makers of
Microsoft Windows or Mac OS X use a pee
ice to make it possible for their
applications to still have interactions
with other applications without having
to reveal the actual code even for open
source code projects like two Ubuntu
operating system api's make easy entry
points to code that other developers
will most frequently use</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
