databases and we're going to focus on
kind of the major ones so we've got one
type of databases that are called
relational databases that often use a
language called SQL to to manipulate
them and so we'll refer to these as
relational databases or or sequel
databases some examples of relational
databases are Postgres which you know we
use that reddit we currently use that
Hipmunk you know and lots of people use
this it happens to be my favorite
there's my sequel which is extremely
popular and this is used by Facebook and
basically everybody not strictly
everybody but my sequel is far and away
the most popular database and I'm sure
you will encounter it in your web
development adventures also pretty
common is sequel Lite which we'll
actually use in this class this is a
really lightweight simple database it's
not for working on huge amounts of data
like post cards and my sequel might be
it's it's it's generally better as a
replacement for like you know where you
would normally use flat files but really
handy and of course there's also Oracle
which is a huge company that sells the
Oracle database product and incidentally
Oracle bought my sequel a number of
years ago but it has largely you know
left it free and open these these are
all free and these databases all
basically work with tables they use a
language called SQL to manipulate those
tables and we're going to talk about
that in this class of fair amount and on
our you know general purpose you know
handy things there are other databases
in the world some examples might be on
Google App engines data store which
which is what we're going to be using a
lot in this class and it's got a lot of
similarities with these relational
databases but also a lot of differences
and we'll spend a fair amount of time
talking about these differences dynamo
which is by Amazon and the reason I
mentioned this is because there is a
great paper online that describes how
this database works and I'll include it
in the course notes it's it's worth a
read it's a really nice approach and
they've you know
take a completely different approach
from how these sequel databases and
there's a you know a lot to learn there
there's the no sequel databases of these
maybe Mongo is pretty popular couch is
pretty popular we're not going to
discuss these much in this class but
these are products that try to solve
some of the limitations that sequel
places on you that we'll get to in a
moment but you know in this class we're
going to focus on kind of the basics of
SQL and then Google App engines data
store and how to use those to build your
your web apps okay quick quiz which
database is the best</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
