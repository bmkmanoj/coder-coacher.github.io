for now about coverage so let's take a
concrete look of what coverage can do
for us in practice how it can help us do
better testing we're gonna do here is
look at some random open source Python
code that implements a splay tree and
before we get into the details let me
briefly explain what a splay tree is and
broadly speaking a splay tree is just a
kind of binary search tree and a binary
search tree is a tree where every node
has two leaves and it supports
operations such as insert delete and
lookup the main important thing about a
binary search tree the keys have to
support an order in relation and so an
order in relation is anything that
assigns a total ordering to all of the
keys in the space just a simple example
if we're using integers for keys then we
could use less than for our ordering
relation or for example if we're using
words as our keys then we can use
dictionary order and so again it doesn't
matter what kind of a datatype the key
is in a binary search tree all that
really matters is is the keys we're
gonna use to lookup elements in the tree
have this ordering relation the way the
binary search tree is gonna work is
we're gonna build up a tree under the
invariant that the left child of any
node always has a key that's ordered
before the key of the parent node and
the right child is always ordered after
the parent node using the ordering and
so hopefully what you can see now is
that if we build up some sort of a large
tree with this kind of shape we have a
procedure for fast lookup and the way
that lookup works is when we're
searching for a particular key in the
binary search tree we only have to walk
one path from the root down to the
leaves we always know which subtree
might contain the key that we're looking
for of course we have to actually go
down into that sub tree to see if it's
there but the point is we only have to
walk one path through the tree and the
upshot is that generally operations on
this kind of a search tree are going to
require on a number of tree operations
logarithmic in the number of tree nodes
so for example if we have a tree with a
million nodes and if that tree that we
bill it ends up being relatively
balanced then usually we're going to
expect to do about log base two of a
million tree operations as part of a
lookup or an insert or a delete and so
we're going to end up doing roughly 20
operations and so you can see since the
number of operations is far lower than
the number of nodes in the tree that
this is generally considered to be an
efficient kind of a data structure</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
