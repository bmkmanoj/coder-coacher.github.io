for things in bits you can encode any
number though we just need more bits so
if we have more bits we can encode more
different things so here I've got four
bits that means I have four yes new
choices and I can encode 16 different
numbers and the reason for that is
because 2 to the 4 is 16 every time I
add one more bit I double the number of
things because I have one more yes no
question so for just this part of the
graph I had eight things I had three
bits I could distinguish between the
numbers 0 through 7 adding one more bit
doubles the number of things I can
distinguish so that's a way to measure
information and once we can distinguish
any number of things well we can send
any kind of data we want anything that's
discreet we can turn into a number so we
could turn letters into numbers if we
have a long string we could have a
sequence of numbers which we can turn
into one really big number so once we
can send bits we can send anything we
want so that's what bandwidth is it's a
measure of the amount of information
that we can send and we're measuring the
number of bits each bit is one yes or no
decision in computing we usually think
of that as either a 0 or 1 so that long
stream of zeros and ones is there
information we're sending and it could
be encoding a string of texts like it
does in a web page it could be encoding
an image it could be encoding a number
and to measure our bandwidth we need to
know how many bits can we send per
second</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
