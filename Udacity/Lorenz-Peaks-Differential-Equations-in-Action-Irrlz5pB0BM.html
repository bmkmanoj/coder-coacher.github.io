exam we're going to talk a little bit
more about chaos theory especially in
relation to the Lorenz butterfly we have
some system in a state defined by XY and
z now a solution that we might get for
the system depending on how we define
different parameters within the
equations could look something like this
I'm not very good at drawing in 3d but
this should look something like that
classic butterfly image that you want
showed you in the unit you remember that
our solution has two wings one over here
and one over here both spiraling outward
we can plot how Z this coordinate varies
as a function of time and we do this we
see a series of peaks that ascend and
then descend and then re ascend and so
on and so forth this set of peaks of
increasing height corresponds to
spiraling outward along one wing then as
he jumped down to a local minimum the
stepping up word again over here
corresponds to the spiraling outward
along this way what we want to know is
if we can predict the progression of
these local Maxima along the z axis we
can make a plot of the current local
maximum of Z versus the previous local
maximum and then take each of these
maxima and plot them down here so here's
a preview of what you should get as your
solution to this problem up here we can
see how the peaks and z vary with time
clearly these zigzags are a little bit
more accurate than mine work and down
here we see how the present local
maximum depends on the previous local
maximum so you'll know that you've
gotten the problem right if something
like this appears now in order to plot
each local maximum we do in fact we need
to know the exact Z coordinate of that
maximum one issue that we have when
using approximation methods however is
that sometimes our time steps are not
going to line up exactly with the
locations of the peaks so if you look at
this visual for example at step minus 1
we have this value of Z at the step we
have this value and after one more time
step we've passed over the peak and down
once again we plotted this on its own
completely ignores where the actual peak
is and shows them instead that's
substantially lower in order to
approximate better where this actual
peak is we can pretend that there's a
parabola connecting these three
different points the vertex of the
parabola will be our estimate for where
the true location of the peak is to find
out the T coordinate of the peak
you can just simply use the quadratic
formula just a couple of hints for you
we want only one see value to be equal
to the maximum so think about what that
means in terms of our equations down
here also think about how you could use
the central difference formula when
you're discussing these local Maxima
remember that one way to calculate a B
and C is to plug in information about
the points that you know then you'll
have these coefficients and be able to
find the proper value of Z and T let's
take a look at the code for a second now
the first thing that we want you to do
for this problem is to use coins method
which remember from sections 2.9 with a
fixed step size not a variable step size
for the Lorentz system remember that
Hoynes method depends on the forward
Euler methods we've included that for
you right here so again just to be clear
use Hoynes method with non-variable step
size to figure out how XY and z are
going to change with each time step once
you do this you're going to use the
parabola fitting method that I just
discussed to figure out better where the
local maxima are once you've done that
you're going to enter your estimate at
the local maximum value it should be a
fun look into chaos theory good luck</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
