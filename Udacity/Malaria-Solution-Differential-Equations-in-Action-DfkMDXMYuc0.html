with in this problem is the issue of the
mosquito nets now we know that at first
there are no mosquito nets in place at
all so we're going to create this
variable called net factor and
initialize it to one we know that after
100 days net factor is reduced by bite
reduction by net this constant that we
created up here so we add in this if
statement right here saying that after
100 days net factor is reduced by point
nine which is bite reduction by net
remember that this is basically the
probability that a person is going to be
bitten it makes sense that if you add in
a mosquito net the probability of you
being bitten will go down now for
implementing the forward Euler method
with the infected populations both human
and mosquito for the number of infected
humans at the next time step we of
course need to start with the number of
affected humans at the previous step to
this we're going to add on the number of
people that are being added to the
infected population we're going to
subtract the number of people that are
moving out of the infected into the
susceptible population let's first think
about the term that's being added to the
number of infected humans we take the
probability of a person being bitten
which isn't it factor times the number
of bytes per day and pre mosquito that a
person gets also multiply that by the
number of infected mosquitoes and then
we multiply this by the fraction of the
total human population that is still
susceptible also multiply this by the
probability of a mosquito transmitting
malaria to a human on the other side of
the coin we have the factors that move
people away from the infected population
and back into the susceptible population
this is a very simple term we simply
take the number of people that were
affected at the previous time step and
divide this by the time that it takes a
person to recover remember that all that
was multiplied by H and added to the
number of people infected at the
previous time step now let's take a look
at how the infected mosquito population
is changing since we're using the
forward Euler method we start with the
number of infected mosquitoes at the
previous step and then add to this H
times a bunch of other things now to
find out how many mosquitoes are moving
into the infected group we start with
the probability of a mosquito biting a
person which of course might give the
mosquito malaria as well multiply this
by the bytes per day mosquito multiply
this by the number of susceptible
mosquitoes and the number of infected
humans we then divide this by the total
number of humans and multiply the
transmission probability from human to
mosquito if you remember the drawing
that I showed earlier on in the video
introducing this problem I told you that
the only way that mosquitoes can no
longer be infected is to die they don't
move back to being susceptible this
means that the only thing that is going
to decrease the number of infected
mosquitoes is death of mosquitoes so we
subtract from this entire expression is
one over the mosquito lifetime times the
number of infected mosquitoes at the
previous tip I know that that was a lot
of constants and variables to keep track
of but great job if you are able to fill
all this out now let's take a peek at
what our final graph for unit 3 looks
like now in this graph the blue curve
shows the fraction of humans who are
infected and the green curve shows the
fraction of the number of mosquitoes
that are infected at first glance it
might look like there are many many more
humans infected the mosquitoes but
remember that because this fraction this
doesn't actually show us plain numbers
in fact we started with 10 to the 10th
mosquitoes but only 10 to the 8 humans
so even if a much smaller percent of the
mosquito population is infected than the
human population the mosquitoes are able
to infect such a great portion of the
humans because there are so many more
mosquitoes than there are humans total
we can see that the number of both
humans and mosquitoes infected at first
increases sharply and then levels off
and stays at a very high number however
as soon as 100 days hits and we
introduce the mosquito nets the number
of infected in each population starts to
decrease sharply we can see that a
mosquito net idea was definitely very
effective for helping slow the spread of
malaria in the human population as well
as the mosquito population great job on
all three problems in unit 3 I hope you
found this discussion of the SI our
model and its variations interesting</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
