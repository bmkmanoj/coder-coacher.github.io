this term so that the factors of the
same basis are next to each other I'm
also going to put the constant factor
first so we're going to start with 3
squared then we have two factors that
have a base of X so I'll put those next
to each other and then the last thing we
have is the Y cubed well we know that 3
squared is just 3 x 3 + 3 x 3 is just
nine we also know that when we have X to
the fifth times X to the eighth that's
the same as X to the 5 + 8 power and
nothing is being involved with the Y
cube so it's just going to stay the same
you'll notice I got rid of those
multiplication signs between the
different factors in the term since
they're implied if we just don't write
them now the only thing we need to
simplify here is add together the two
numbers in the exponent of the X so we
get a final answer of 9x to the 13 y to
the third I think that you're going to
find all of this practice with
manipulating exponents really useful as
we keep simplifying expressions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
