memory consistency model that I have
discussed with you before that is
sequential consistency and in sequential
consistency the idea is very simple the
idea is that every process is making
some memory accesses all of these let's
say are shared memory accesses and from
the perspective of the programmer the
expectation is that these memory
accesses are happening in the textual
order that you see here that's the
expectation so far as this program is
concerned similarly if you see the set
of memory accesses that are happening on
a different processor p2 once again the
expectation is that the order in which
these memory accesses are happening are
the textual order now the real question
is what happens to the accesses that are
happening in one processor with respect
to the accesses that are happening on
another processor if they are accessing
exactly the same memory location for
instance p1 is reading memory location a
p2 is writing to a memory location a
what is the order between this read by
p1 and this write by p2 this is where
sequential consistency model says that
the interleaving of memory accesses
between multiple processes here I am
showing you 2 but you can have n number
of these processors making accesses to
shared memory all in parallel when that
happens you want to observe the textual
or program order for the accesses on the
individual processors but the
interleaving of the memory accesses
coming from the different processors is
arbitrary so in other words the
sequential memory consistency model
builds on the atomicity for individual
read/write operations and says that
individual read/write operations are
atomic on any given processor and the
program order has to be preserved and in
order to think about the interleaving of
the memory accesses that are happening
on different processes that can be
arbitrary and that should be consistent
with the thinking of the programmer and
I also gave you the analogy of a card
shark to illustrate what is going on
with a sequential memory consistency
model
so the cardshark is taking two splits of
a card deck and doing a perfect merge
shuffle of the two splits and that's
exactly what's going on with sequential
consistency if you think of these memory
accesses on an individual processor as
the card split but instead of a two-way
split you have an N way split and we are
doing a merge shuffle of all the N Way
splits of the memory accesses to get the
sequentially consistent memory model</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
