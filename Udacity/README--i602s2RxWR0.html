readme file let's first take a closer
look at the various sections that make a
readme useful for this example we're
going to be taking a look at Ledbetter a
project that's maintained by github
itself now I don't really know what
Ledbetter does but that's not what we're
looking at here we're looking at the
language that's being used in this
readme and the parts that make it up a
readme should provide just enough
context to get a user up and running
with your code keep in mind we are
writing this for other humans we'll
start with a title and a description a
sentence or two will work just fine but
be sure to capture the spirit of your
project clearly and concisely this will
help frame the readers experience when
going through your documentation if
you're feeling extra fancy you can
include your projects logo if it has one
next include any information that is
absolutely necessary for understanding
your code this may be dependencies on
their software or libraries installation
instructions common usage or known bugs
it's worth mentioning once again that
there's no formal standard for what a
readme should look like don't feel
pressured to make your reading any
particular length some can be extremely
short while others will need to be much
longer it just depends on your project
the important part is that you
communicate clearly and concisely any
information that is essential for the
user and that you don't make any
assumptions about what the end user
already knows it's up to you to decide
what is and isn't essential information
a few good questions to ask yourself
include what are the exact steps that
need to be taken to get this code base
up and running what should they already
have installed or configured what might
they have a hard time understanding
right away often developers will include
a getting started or installation
section to help with any initial setup
that may need to happen before using
your code if it's helpful include
example code to better illustrate your
end-users proper usage of your code it's
important to be mindful of the
assumptions you make about what the
users expected to know remember you're
familiar with your code already so think
about it from the perspective of someone
who's never seen this before for
instance
by making eggs benedict and my recipe
called for a poached egg I might be
alienating new chefs by not explaining
what a poached egg is ultimately the
amount of detail that you choose to
include is it to you but for
particularly difficult concepts it might
be a good idea to include some extra
detail</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
