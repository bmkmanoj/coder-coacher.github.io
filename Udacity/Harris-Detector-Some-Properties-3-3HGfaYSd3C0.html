intensity now most of the time again if
you remember our earlier work on looking
at image intensity and images mostly it
in fact an image intensity changes
because we have more bright pixels or
less bright pixels so in essence mostly
this would require us to be invariant to
additive and multiplicative changes in
image intensity and most of the time the
competition we are looking at since it's
dependent on the gradient information
would be invariant as long as at any
point within the neighborhood
irrespective of the brightness at that
point the invariance or the gradients at
that point are the same so again
essentially what happens at any point in
an image as long as we are working with
derivatives we should be able to kind of
compute the information the response
function and response functions purely
being dependent on the derivatives would
not care if the image intensity of the
region that we're looking at is much
larger from one to the other so in
essence what we're just repeating here
is it would be invariance to any kind of
intensity shift if you add a constant
derivatives actually still won't care
and similarly if there was a scale again
the derivatives would not be impacted
and all of that actually still same
results would appear this is
demonstrated by again our example by
basically I look at the response
function R and depends on where I
threshold right because if I threshold
at that level and if these two points
are the ones that I'm looking for I'll
still detect them but if I choose the
threshold and now somebody has scaled my
intensity variations which will impact
this then it might actually cause a
problem so then we basically would have
to have an adaptive threshold that moves
more about the scaling effect of the
intensities in an image but otherwise we
still should be able to find because the
shape of the response one response over
the whole sequence should still be the
same</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
