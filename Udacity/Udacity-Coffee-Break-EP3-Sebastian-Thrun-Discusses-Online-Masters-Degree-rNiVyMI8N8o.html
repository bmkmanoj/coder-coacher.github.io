it's quite amazing yeah
we launched this master's degree would
you like to talk a little bit about it I
would say via now instant we're now on
to do it but yeah it's amazing so we
really have a fantastic partner we have
Georgia Tech which is talking five
computer science department it's really
amazing before AT&amp;amp;T as one of the key
innovators in the mobile space and
access space teaming up to change higher
education how cool is that and how do
you think this will play out for you
know our students and what are your
aspirations for our students on this I
mean when I when I was a student I
wouldn't have access to great teachers
at all and I was always wanting to have
this and I finally flew the United
States and became a little visitor at
Carnegie Mellon University to get that
access but most of us can't do it so I
think this is gonna be open up which
means we can everyone the world will be
able to have access and getting to be
clear this is available for everyone in
the world yeah we get a lot of questions
like what does this mean will they have
to travel here it's fully online it's
fully online now to be eligible to
McMaster students you have to be
admitted and you have to meet certain
prerequisites but we're gonna make the
internet courses free free of charge
available for anybody wants to learn and
we're gonna make that kind of a
credential for people who aren't
admissible to a master's degree but
still would like to be credentialed and
those who be relatively cheap
they'll be great I can imagine people
taking one course to courses three or
four courses but not even the full one
and get a huge value for those six five
courses seven eight nine twelve twelve
the thing is number tombery of course is
to get messaging but you could actually
choose if you are working and a busy
student you'll have the option to choose
out of that and you can take them
individually and you can use when you're
12 years old you can do it when you 82
great amazing so we're very happy to
talk about this master's degree please
read the blog online as fashion talks a
little bit more about it and sign up for
it for more news cheers Cheers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
