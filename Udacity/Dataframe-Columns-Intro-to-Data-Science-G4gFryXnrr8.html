frame why don't we talk about how we can
access the data we can operate on
specific columns by calling on them as
if they were a key in the dictionary for
example if we wanted just the name
column of this data frame I could simply
type the F name I could also grab more
than one column by passing in a list of
column names as opposed to just one
column name for example say I wanted the
name and age columns I could say DF name
comma age I can also call on specific
rows by calling the data frame objects
look method and passing the row index as
an argument for example if I only wanted
the row corresponding the passenger
bronde
whose index is a I could simply say DF
Luke a we can also use true/false
statements regarding columns of the data
frame to subset the data frame for
example let's say I wanted rows of this
data frame only where the passenger age
was greater than or equal to 30 I could
simply say DF where DF age greater than
or equal to 30 you can see here that
I've only picked out rows B and D which
were the rows where our passenger is in
fact older than 30 this ability to
subset our data frame based on true
false statements in the index is not
limited to the entire row I can also
perform this operation on particular
columns for example let's say I only
wanted this survived information for
these two rows B and D I can simply say
DF survived DF age greater than or equal
to 30 let's pick apart what this
statement is doing since it's a little
bit complicated
first DF survived is going to pick out
only the survived column of our data
frame this section here says I basically
only want the indices where DF age is
greater than or equal to 30 then I say
of this array of values give me only the
values where the indices are equal to
the indices where this statement is true</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
