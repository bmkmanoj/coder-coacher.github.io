intimately tied to everyday lives it has
put information that we seek at our
fingertips remedies for the common cold
dinner recipes sports updates
developments in the Middle East
you name it you will find it on the
Internet we know that the creation of
such content happens from the basement
of individuals like you and me as well
as businesses such as CNN BBC and NBC
whose work it is to create such content
how is the content on the internet
stored and distributed in the first two
lessons of this module we looked at the
server end of the giant scale services
how a computational resources organized
in the data center how is the data
organized internally in the
computational nodes of the cluster and
what is the programming model for
dealing with the big data associated
with giant scale services and for
exploiting all the computational
resources that are available in the
server forms at data centers in this
lesson we look at content distribution
networks that is how is information
organized located and distributed when
we are looking for them once again the
issue is dealing with the scale of the
problem the content is generated
worldwide and users are trying to access
the content worldwide as well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
