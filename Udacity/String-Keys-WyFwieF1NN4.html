you can use it with string keys - you
just need to come up with some hash
function that converts letters into
numbers individual letters can be pretty
easily converted into ASCII values and
many languages already have functions
built-in that do that we can combine the
ASCII values with a formula to get a
unique hash for each letter so what
should our hash function look like again
there are some trade-offs here do we
want every word in its own bucket are
you okay with collisions but want a
relatively simple hash function if you
have 30 or less words you can probably
just use the ASCII value for the first
letter of a string as a hash value the
standard hash code function for string
keys and Java fare is a large hash table
over having any collisions the formula
looks something like this
for example let's say we're going to
hash the word Udacity and we're starting
with the first two letters of the string
ud we can plug these s key values into
the equation to get a hash value that is
unique to our string why does this work
well by multiplying the ASCII value for
each letter by a power of some number
like 31 we can guarantee that every
number representation or hash value will
be unique to that string a hash function
like that would be great for a
dictionary where we need unique buckets
for each string however strings with
just three or four letters already have
huge hash values the trade off is really
important here as long as you have the
space for it a unique hash value can be
really useful lastly why is the number
31 used here the earliest hash functions
took advantage of some properties of the
number 31 and research showed that it
was a great choice for this kind of
string hashing however now there are
more complex hash functions that have
been discovered so 31 is more of a
convention than the best value for every
situation
remember that designing a solution for
your keys is the most important thing
don't get too bogged
and all of these conventions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
