distributions which are modeled by a
special probability density function
we're not gonna go over the equation for
this probability density function in
this course but if you want you can
easily look it up and see what it is and
that might be pretty cool for some of
you that wants a little bit more
information but basically since we have
this theoretical curve we can model it
with an equation and then using this
equation we can use calculus to find the
area under the curve but we don't need
to use calculus because someone else
already did and then they created a
special table so that we can always
figure out the area under the curve
between any two values we're gonna use
this table later first let's make sure
we're all up to speed on the normal
probability density function and the
area underneath first the tails never
actually touch the x-axis they get
closer and closer to the x-axis so the
x-axis is a horizontal asymptote
the reason the tails of this theoretical
model don't touch the x-axis is
basically because we can never be 100%
sure of anything in other words we could
have a value way out here really far
from the mean like five standard
deviations away but the probability of
getting this value or lower is very
small and it's equal to the area under
the curve so if we could zoom in we
would see this tail get closer and
closer to the x-axis but never touching
and then the area in between the tail
and the x-axis all the way to negative
infinity is the probability of getting
this value or lower we'll go more into
depth in that in a second and similarly
we could get a value way out here but
the probability is very small so
basically what you have to remember is
that if we have a certain value let's
just call it X for now that the area
under the curve from negative infinity
to X is equal to the probability of
randomly selecting a subject in our
scene
less than X and this is equal to the
proportion in the sample or population
with scores less than X if this
probability is 80% then we say X is the
80th percentile if this probability is
90% we say X is the 90th percentile etc
if this is a little confusing don't
worry that's the whole point of this
lesson you're going to get really
comfortable with using the probability
density functions and analyzing this
area and finding this area</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
