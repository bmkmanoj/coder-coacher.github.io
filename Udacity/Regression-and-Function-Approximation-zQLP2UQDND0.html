with function approximation or
regression so how does this notion of
regression of falling back toward the
mean have to do with this idea of
approximating functions mapping inputs
to output it seems kind of odd so it
turns out that the relationship is
here's the here's the connection between
them I'm gonna draw a graph and on this
axis will be the parent height and on
this axis will be the average child
height so if we plot these against each
other let's let me put the mean up here
let's say that this is mean height for
the population and now say that you know
parent we sort of imagined that parents
of average height will have children of
average height but parents that are
really tall like that hypothetical
person from before will have children
that are taller than average but not as
tall as themselves and similarly people
that are very let's say of smaller
stature will have children that are also
you know short and but not quite as
short again closer to the mean and it
turns out that you have this this very
nice linear relationship between these
quantities and there's an important
aspect to this which is that the slope
of this line is less than 1 it's 2/3
right if the slope of this line was 1
what would that mean Charles that would
mean that everybody's children had the
same height of their parents right right
and so that's exactly right and so but
if the slope is less than 1 like it is
it turns out to be in real populations
then what's happening is the children
are a little shorter than the parents
children of tall parents are shorter
than they are and the children of short
parents are taller than they are and
that's the fact that this is less than 1
is what makes it regression to the mean
now this this was worked out in I
believe the late 1800s and it was just
such a beautiful way of connecting all
these different quantities together to
kind of think of them as being related
in this functional way that people said
oh this is really great I'm gonna use
this idea of regression and what they
started to mean actually was this
this idea of regression to the mean but
this idea of finding a mathematical
relationship based on a bunch of
measurements of points so this term
ended up getting misused but that's the
term that we have now so regression now
refers to not this idea of collapsing
back towards towards the mean but the
idea of using functional form to
approximate a bunch of data points isn't
that weird that's pretty cool
there's another example of this sort of
idea where where a reasonable word like
regression which we're referring to some
physical thing in the in the world due
to experiments like psych experiments
this point became this mathematical
concept where the name doesn't really
fit anymore like there isn't really
anything regressing in what we're doing
there's another really important example
that we're gonna get to later in the
course do you know what I'm thinking of
Charles no so reinforcement learning is
my field of study and often your field
of study often often and it turns out
that reinforcement learning doesn't mean
what the words mean anymore that this
was a concept that the psychologists
used to explain what they were observing
and then some mathematicians well it's
called them computer scientists took the
word themselves started to use it and
used it wrong but now it's stuck and
regression is another example like that
the word is sort of being used wrong but
it's stuck and that's what we're gonna
use
so this explains why every time I have a
conversation with a psychologist about
reinforcement learning we talk past each
other yes they get very confused I tried
it to tell them upfront that's not
really what I mean but I'm gonna use the
words anyway but it still confuses them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
