parents that she had mild retardation
now her father who was not mentally
stable thought that this meant that she
was severely retarded and that she
needed protection
now what happens next is quite tragic
throughout her life during the day her
father tired to a chair and in the
evenings he caged her in a crib moreover
whenever Jeannie tried to speak her
father beat her and barked at her like a
dog now this happened throughout her
life until she was about 13 years old
when her mother ran away and took
Jeannie with her now when the social
worker first met Jeannie she thought she
was only 6 or 7 years old and this is
because Jeannie was only 4 foot 6 inches
tall and 59 pounds not what you would
expect from a typically-developing
thirteen and a half year old
in addition Jeannie had very limited
language abilities she could only say
things such as no more or stop it
interestingly after four years of
language training Jeannie still had
limited language abilities she could
meet simple demands in terms of speaking
simple sentences but she could not speak
romantically interestingly though her
language comprehension was much better
than her language production meaning
that she was able understand much of
what people said to her</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
