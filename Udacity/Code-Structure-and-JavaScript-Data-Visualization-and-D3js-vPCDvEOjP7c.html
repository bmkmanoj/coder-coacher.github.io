of the structure of Mike's code to give
you a sense of how to organize your own
and also I want to explain some of the
elements we may not have encountered in
the console in the examples we've been
through at the very top here we have a
script tag which actually loads our d3
library right below the script tag we
have a style tag which can be used to
add styles to the graphics and elements
created through t3 much of the logic of
the visualization comes next
wrapped in a draw function and just a
small point all of these first three
things I've covered are contained within
the head tag of our HTML page as soon as
we open our body tag we put an SVG with
class chart to hold the visualization
and finally the last bit of JavaScript
loads our external data file and then
calls our draw function because
javascript is asynchronous the code you
see here isn't necessarily executed in
the order it is written here whenever a
browser reads in an HTML file it reads
it from top to bottom and parses each
line of either HTML CSS JavaScript or
SVG but even though a JavaScript
function may be parsed doesn't
necessarily mean it will be executed and
one last point of frustration often for
newcomers to JavaScript is the idea of a
callback all a callback is is a function
that gets executed once another function
completes we'll see in just a second how
D 3 leverages callbacks the first line
of JavaScript that actually gets
executed in this HTML is the last line
that loads our external data file once
the data file is loaded and only then
does the draw callback function get
executed and again the draw function is
what contains most of the logic to build
our visualization and since the draw
function and all of the code contained
within it needs some data to bind to and
visualize and only when the data is
fully loaded does they get passed as the
argument to the draw function</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
