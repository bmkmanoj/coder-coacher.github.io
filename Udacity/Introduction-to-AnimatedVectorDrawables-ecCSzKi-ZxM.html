we'll take a look at the vector drawable
and animated vector drawable classes
will start by looking at what vector
drawable allows us to do to understand
what we can animate vector drawable was
introduced in lollipop and lets you
create density independent images by
defining a series of drawing commands
it's similar in concept to SVG on the
web here's an example of a vector
drawable it defines a path which has a
series of space separated drawing
commands which use a subset of the SVG
path data spec to draw lines curves and
so on for example these commands draw a
cross by moving to a point drawing a
line to another point lifting and moving
to another point and drawing another
line simple now vectors aren't
appropriate for every kind of image you
wouldn't want to represent a person's
face with a vector for example but
iconography and simple illustrations are
great candidates the vector format
provides density independence meaning
that the same image works on any screen
density when vector support reaches
enough devices you won't have to explore
assets at multiple different sizes like
we covered in Lesson one it also
generally produces a small file size but
the opportunity to anime all or parts of
the image is what we're really
interested in right now the animated
vector drawable class lets you animate
any property of a path or set of paths
here's a list of what you can animate
now the first five are pretty standard
animation properties but having the
ability to target individual elements
within the drawable is quite powerful
let's take a closer look at these last
three more unique properties and the
kind of animation that they allow we can
animate the actual path data itself
allowing you to morph so to speak one
shape into another here's a simple
example of changing a tic into a cross
we can of course combine this with other
effects such as throwing in a rotate to
get a little bit fancier the restriction
when more thing is that the shapes need
to have the same number of drawing
commands in them in order to interpolate
between the two states when drawing a
path vector drawable allows you
to only draw a portion of it by trimming
the start or end of it in this example
we had a path which is the handwritten
word android design and animating the
trim on it produces this fun writing
effect vector drawables also support the
notion of clip paths that is applying a
clip region to your drawing animating
this clip region allows you to reveal or
hide portions of the image so in this
example we have a outline heart and then
on top of that a filled heart by
applying a clip region to the filled
heart on top and animating it we can
produce this filling up and emptying
effect these were just a few examples of
what you can do with animated vectors
they're a great opportunity to make your
app feel alive</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
