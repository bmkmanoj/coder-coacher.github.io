this one I think I understand completely
so we know that from the last discussion
we had about how you would recover the
joint that what you're saying on the
right of this equation probability y
times probably of X given Y means that
the probability of Y the the variable Y
doesn't depend on anything so between
those two graphs the one on the right is
the one where you're saying that you
don't need to know the value of any
other variable in order to determine the
probability of Y okay so it has to be
the one on the sect the the second one
and then just to make sure if you look
at the second product the probability of
x given Y there's the second multi can
is it multicam mmm factor here factor
let's say factor the the second factor
this says that well you determine the
probability of x given the value of y
and there is an arrow from Y to X so the
second one is in fact correct yes so
this is actually one way you could just
read this network is to say what is this
node X with an arrow coming into it that
is the probability of X but the things
pointing into it are exactly what's
being given what is being conditioned on
so that's exactly right the second one
right and so this is this makes sense to
me this is why when you look at a
network Bayesian network it's very hard
not to think of them as dependencies
even though they're not dependencies
they're conditional independencies well
the arrows are a form of dependence but
it's not a causal dependence necessarily
it's a it's again it's just the way that
the probabilities are being decomposed
and the last of these three equations is
just Bayes rule this time written
correctly where the denominator has to
be the probability of X and we've gone
over this a couple times I don't I don't
need to describe it again but what I
would like to just bring to your
attention is that these three together
turn out to be kind of our you know
three musketeers in working out the
probability of various kinds of events
