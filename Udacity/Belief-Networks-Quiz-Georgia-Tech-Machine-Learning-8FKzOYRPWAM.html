sometimes also known as Bayes net
sometimes also known as a Bayesian
network sometimes also known as a
graphical model and there's other names
but it's the same idea over and over
again and the idea is that what we're
going to do is we're going to represent
the conditional independence
relationships between all the variables
in the Joint Distribution graphically in
terms of a little picture like this
where there's nodes corresponding to all
the variables and edges corresponding to
dependencies that need to be explicitly
represented so the way that this works
is what we can do is we can fill in the
prior probability of storm which we can
get by just marginalizing out so we've
we've already done an exercise like this
so this is a number that you should be
able to figure out then because of very
well and this is also true that you can
figure out what the probability of
lightning is given storm and also given
not storm and these are numbers that you
can just get by marginalizing out
finally the probability of thunder
normally you'd have to condition that on
both storm and lightning but as we
already talked about it's actually
conditionally independent of storm given
lightning so all we need to figure out
is the probability of thunder given
lightning and the probability of thunder
given not lightning and once we have
these in this case five numbers that's
enough to work out any probability we
want in the joint just by multiplying
corresponding components together so
what I'd like you to do is actually fill
in these boxes as a quiz and to help you
out we copied the numbers over from the
previous slides so that you actually
have the kinds of values that you need
to fill in this table because otherwise
that would have been kind of mean</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
