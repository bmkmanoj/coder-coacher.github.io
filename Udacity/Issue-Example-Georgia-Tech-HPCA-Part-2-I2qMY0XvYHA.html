the tomasulo's algorithm works so
whenever we do something or kind of you
to explain it we will also show how it
works so this is an example of how the
issue is working first this is going to
be our issue queue I'm showing four
instructions here this is the first
instruction this is the second one third
one and so on so we will issue in
program order which means the first
instruction that we're going to be issue
is going to be this F two equals F four
plus F 1 this is really an ad but I'm
writing it this way because it's more
compact next for each of the
floating-point registers which we are
going to name F 1 F 2 F 3 and F for
there is a register alias table or rad
where we're going to keep which
instruction is supposed to produce that
register if there is nothing here
that actually points to the register
file so pretty much if there is nothing
here in F 1 that's going to mean that
you can just find the value for F 1 in
the actual F 1 in the register file this
is a register file we have four
registers and these are their actual
values when we go through the example we
will actually compute with them so again
this is the register file again the rat
when it's empty says that basically this
means with F one can just be read from
the register file you don't have to wait
for anything and finally we're going to
have our reservation stations we're
going to name them RS 1 2 3 4 the add
reservation stations and 4 &amp;amp; 5 for the
multiplication reservation station so we
really have 5 reservation stations but
note that you can use only these 3 for
ads and only these 3 for multiplies
divides now we are ready to actually
issue an instruction so again this is
going to be the first one we issue the
first step is to take it from the
instruction buffer the next step is to
look at the rat and find whether our
inputs are ready or not and in this case
both of the inputs are ready F 1 and F 4
are both available so we're going to say
that this is an ADD and we're going to
take the value 4 in this case F 4 and F
1 and that's going to be 0.71 and it's
going to be 3.14 and place the
instruction in the reservation station
of course that assumes that the
a reservation station available we will
see eventually what happens when there
isn't any and the final step for
register renaming is to say that the
result of the instruction f2 is going to
come from now on from the division
station 1 so here we will write RS 1
so future instructions that won't F 2
are not gonna read -1 they're gonna wait
for this result to be produced so this
is the renaming of the very first
instruction one final step that we will
do of course is remove this instruction
from the issue queue and what's going to
happen now is this is going to shift
down but for my example that's going to
be very difficult to do so I'm just
going to kind of cross out this
instruction so this is this just means
that you know this instruction has been
removed from the issue queue to make
things more interesting for remaining
instructions and also to see what
happens when an instruction is renamed
let's issue one or two more instructions
so let's issue the next instruction
which is this one this is a divide we
need to find a free reservation station
here say it's a divide F 2 and F 3 are
going to be the parameters for this
instruction F 2 comes from our s 1 so we
cannot simply read this value here we
are going to say here that our s 1 is
what we are waiting for but F 3 is
available so we are going to get 2.72
from the register file and we know now
mark this instruction as we're going to
basically take it out of the issue queue
and this is so very easy to forget but
when we do that we need to mark that the
result the F 1 is from now are not going
to be coming from here it's going to be
coming from reservation station 4 and
we're going to issue this instruction -
it's a subtraction so it's going to go
here F 1 and F 2 are the parameters we
see that neither of those two can be
read from the register file so what
we're going to do is we're going to mark
here that that the first parameter is
going to be produced by rs4 the second
one is going to be produced by RS 1
we're going to Denmark that F 4 is
coming from our stool
and we're going to remove this
instruction from the issue queue of
course more instructions are probably
going to come this way but we're not
going to look at that because again that
that with too many instructions for this
example now let's say that that wasn't
an issue slot here we then couldn't
issue the next instruction in the next
cycle until we are actually done
executing by one of these tool I'm not
going to do that but just just keep in
mind that when you wanna show an
instruction you first have to check
whether a reservation station is
available if not then which simply
cannot issue that instruction lets issue
it now because we do have room for it
it's an edition of F 2 and F 3 F 2 comes
from reservation station 1 F 3 comes
from the register file so we're just
going to take the 2.72 we're going to
then rename F 1 to point to this result
and now we see that F 1 is already
renamed to reservation station 4 that's
basically if you want to use F 1 since
this instruction you would be waiting
for its result but now F 1 is being
basically renamed to another reservation
station so this is how register renaming
here works in tomasulo's algorithm so
what we're going to do is we're going to
basically overwrite this with the name
of this reservation station which is RS
3 and now we have issued all of our four
instructions in a real processor you
would issue one instruction each cycle
and probably some of these instructions
would have executed by the time we issue
all of them but I just wanted to show
you how issue works if for example not
include execute for some reason now that
we have gone through an example of
issuing let's see what the next step is</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
