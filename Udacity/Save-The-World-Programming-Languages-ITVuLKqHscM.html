this unit strings are just sequences of
characters and manipulating strings is
going to be critically important for
making a web browser modern programming
languages support regular expressions
which are just a concise notation for
specifying sets of strings and using
regular expressions is more flexible
than using fixed string matching like
string defined with regular expressions
we can define phone numbers words
numbers quoted strings and given a
regular expression we can search for and
match it in a bigger string finite state
machines are a pictorial equivalent to
regular expressions every regular
expression concatenation plus ? star has
an equivalent finite state machine and
in fact although I didn't show it vice
versa every regular expression as a
finite state machine and every finite
state machine has a regular expression
and then every finite state machine can
be converted to a deterministic finite
state machine no epsilon no ambiguity
once we have a deterministic finite
state machine we can simulate it and it
turns out it's very easy about 10 lines
of recursive code to see if a
deterministic finite state machine
accepts a string in fact you've written
that code now that you know how to
implement regular expressions take the
regular expression make a finite state
machine make it deterministic call FSM
sim we'll just use pythons regular
expression library but it's doing
exactly those steps under the hood it
works the same way you would in our next
exciting episode we're going to use this
knowledge to specify important parts of
HTML and JavaScript like string
constants or hypertext tags as the first
step to writing our web browser one
great resource available to you as you
revise this material and work on the
homework is the forums be sure to check
them out if you are wondering about
something almost certainly someone else
was wondering as well post your question
others will benefit from seeing it
answered be courteous but be curious we
all benefit from questions and let me
just leave you with this XKCD comic
while they're talking about pearl
everything said applies to Python and
soon you will be using regular
expressions to save the world</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
