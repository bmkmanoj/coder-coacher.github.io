speak to determine variables of interest
there's a tool that we can use to create
a number of scatter plots automatically
it's called a scatter plot matrix in a
scatter plot matrix there's a grid of
scatter plots between every pair of
variables as we've seen scatter plots
are great but not necessarily suited for
all types of variables for example
categorical ones so there are other
types of visualizations that can be
created instead of scatter plots like
box plots or histograms when the
variables are categorical let's produce
the scatter plot matrix for our pseudo
Facebook data set we're going to use the
GG Ally package to do so so make sure
you've installed it and then go ahead
and load it using the library command
now I'm also going to set the theme here
to know there's two other things that we
want to do first we want to set the seed
so we get reproducible results now you
might be wondering why we set the seed
in the first place and it's because
we're going to sample from our data set
our data set contains all these
variables and I actually don't want all
the variables I don't want user ID your
joined or your joined up bucket so what
I can do is subset my data frame and
then sample from that subset if I check
out the variables in my subset data
frame these are the ones of interest now
I didn't use your joined our year joint
bucket because this one's a categorical
variable and really these were derived
from tenure now I'm ready to use the GG
pairs function inside of GG Ally to
create this scatter plot matrix now I've
already run this piece of code and I do
want to warn you that it takes a long
time for this to generate it might even
take over an hour feel free to run the
command and if it's taking a long time
for your plot to generate just come back
to your computer at another time we've
also included a PDF of the scatter plot
in the instructor notes so you can check
that out as well here's our scatter plot
matrix and notice in the upper part of
the matrix we can see the correlation
coefficients for the pairs of variables
for age and date of birth year the
correlation is actually negative one and
we can see that on the scatter plot
sometimes we may want to produce these
types of matrices so that way we can
produce one number summaries of the
different relationships of our variables
this is just like the correlation work
that we did in Lesson four
so I've described the plots above the
diagonal for the scatter plot matrix but
what do you notice in the lower left of
the scatter plot
matrix write a few sentences about what
you see in this next quiz and pay
careful attention to the variable of
gender what types of plots do you think
these are</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
