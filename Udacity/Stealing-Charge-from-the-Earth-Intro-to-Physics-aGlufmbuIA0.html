method to charge by induction this
method just like the first method also
uses two spheres but here one of those
spheres is actually the earth so let's
say you have your conducting sphere and
it's attached to the ground by a
conducting rod let's also add a bunch of
wires that extend into the ground and
then let's hold a positive charge over a
conducting sphere what's going to happen
is that we're going to actually draw
electrons from the earth if we then
detach this sphere we can even remove
the positive charge and now here we have
it a negatively charged sphere and these
negative charges somehow came from the
ground now of course this must mean that
throughout the earth there must be a few
extra positive charges lingering around
they've lost their electrons it seems
like if we were to do this experiment
over and over and over
well eventually we'd have a positively
charged earth and that might be a
problem it turns out that this is a
non-issue and I want you to tell me why
you think this works and why it's a
non-issue
maybe you think the earth is somehow
able to create electrons create these
negative charges so that actually
there's no residual positive charge left
over maybe has something to do with the
fact that the earth is huge
maybe that has something to do with the
reason why this never becomes a problem
where we actually wind up charging the
earth some noticeable now or maybe you
think the earth is an insulator
something in which charges cannot move
and that this somehow saves us and
allows this whole process to work check
what you think is the best answer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
