by default and cannot be reached outside
of the cluster use the couv TTL port for
command to map a local port to port
inside the model if Todd use two
terminals one to run the coop CTL poor
for command and the other to issue curl
commands now on our new terminal will
start talking to our pod okay let's see
what happens when we hit the secure
employment uh-oh let's try logging in to
get an auth token back from our monolith
I'll use the super secret password
password as my password will use the JWT
token from the output to hit our secure
endpoint and it works and everything is
good in the world again use the coop CTL
loss command to view the logs for the
monolith pod let's open another terminal
and use the dash f flag to get a stream
of logs happening in real time and as
you can see the logs are updating in
real time we can use the coop CTLs zec
command to run an interactive shell
inside the monolith pod this can come in
handy when you want to trouble shoot
from within the container for example
once we have a shell into the model of
container we can test external
connectivity using the ping command now
when you're done with the interactive
shell be sure to log out as you can see
interacting with pause is as easy as
using the coop CTL command whether
you're trying to hit your containers
remotely or trying to get a login shell
for troubleshooting KU bearnaise
provides everything you need to get up
and going</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
