you to print out a table called expand
which doesn't exist right now what
expand is is a table of the same size as
grid that maintains at what step each
node was expanded so the very first node
over here was expanded time 0 the second
node to expand was this one over here 1
2 3 4 5 6 7 in this table every node has
never been expanded including all the
obstacle nodes should have the value of
minus 1 like these guys over here these
are obstacles and when the node is
expanded it should get a unique number
that is incremented from expansion to
expansion and counts from 0 in this case
all the way to 22 for each in the goal
state to give you a second example how
the code should work let me block off
the goal by adding 1 over here so
there's an entire items that block the
left side from the right side now the
search fails and in the expansion list
you find that all the nodes on the right
side has never been expanded so get 0 1
2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 little warning this is
not unique depending on how you break
ties you might expand in a different
order so I don't expect your table to
always look exactly the same way as this
one over here so example you might have
0 2 over here and 1 over here but four
should be the cases when there is a
forward full blockage the right side
should just never expand</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
