pretty well Michael how's it going with
you
good thank you good good good guess what
we're gonna talk about today well
reading off the screen it looks like
maybe ensemble learning and boosting
whatever that is yes that's exactly what
we're going to talk about we're going to
talk about a class of algorithms called
up samba learners and I think you will
see that they're related to some of the
stuff that we've been doing already and
in particular we're going to spend most
of our time focusing on boosting
boosting is my favorite of the ensemble
learning algorithms so are you ready for
that yeah let's do it okay so I want to
start this out by going through a little
exercise with you I want you to think
about a problem okay and the particular
problem I want you to think about is
spam email I think about that a lot so
normally if we were thinking of this as
a classification task right we're we're
going to take some email and we're going
to decide whether it's spam or not given
what we talked about so far we would be
thinking about using a decision tree or
you know neural networks or K and n
whatever that means with email we would
be coming up with all of these sort of
complicated things I want to propose an
alternative which is going to get us to
ensemble learning okay and here's the
alternative I don't want you to try to
think of some complicated rule that you
might come up with that would capture
spam email instead I want you to come up
with some simple rules that are
indicative of spam email okay so really
be specific Michael we have this problem
of spam email that is you you're going
to get some email message and you want
some computer program to figure out
automatically for you whether something
is a piece of spam or isn't and I want
you to help me write a set of rules
that'll help me to figure that out okay
and I want you to think about simple
rules so can you think of any simple
rules that might indicate that something
is spam all right I can yeah I can think
of some simple rules I don't think
they'd be very good but they might be
better than you know nothing like if for
example it mentions how manly I am I
I would be willing to believe that was a
spam message so like if the body the
message contains the word manly okay I
like that let's write that one down
there like that the body contains manly
I like that rule because
I often get naan spam messages talking
about manly so I guess one man's spam is
another man's normal email guess that's
chip probably any other rules sure if it
you know if it comes from my spouse it's
probably not spam okay so let's see from
spouse her name's Lisa now we're going
to call her spouse so let's say - I'm
gonna build a plus here so we know some
rules are indicative of being spam and
some rules are indicative not being spam
okay anything else possibly the length
of the message I guess like what I don't
know I don't know that this would be
very accurate but I think some of the
some of the spam I get sometimes is very
very short
just like the it's like the you are like
hey check out this site and then there's
a URL mmm I like that so we'll just say
short just contains URLs hmm I like
those rules it's say think of anything
else oh how about this one it's just an
image hmm
I get a lot of those where it's just an
image I see like in its and if you look
at the picture it's all various
pharmaceuticals from Canada
exactly here's one I get a lot mmm lots
of misspelled words that you end up
reading as being a real word hmm but I
don't know how I'd write that as a rule
well you could just list the words like
rules that word to have already been
modified in that way kind of a kind of a
black list a black was the words okay
so words like I was saying manly but you
were saying prawn or whatever that says
yeah so and there tons of these right I
mean another one that's very popular if
you're old enough anyway is this one you
remember this one oh sure that was
sometimes a virus yes our young our
younger viewers will not know this but
this was one of the first big spam
messages that would get out there make
money fast and there's tons and tons of
these we could come up with a bunch of
them now here's something they all kind
of have in common Michael and you've
touched on this already all of them are
sort of right there useful but now one
of them
is going to be very good at telling us
whether a message is spam on its own
right so the word manly is evidence but
it's not enough to decide whether
something is spam or not it's from your
spouse that's evidence it's not spam but
sometimes you get messages from your
spouse that are in fact spam because in
fact she didn't actually send them right
and so on and so forth and sometimes you
get emails from princes in Nigeria I do
and they're not always spam I actually
do but in any case and sometimes people
ask you for money and maybe that's
message you want to ignore but isn't
necessarily spam and some people are
actually very interested in getting
messages like this and don't consider it
spam right so so okay so so I could see
that these would all maybe provide some
evidence but it seems really hard to
figure out the right way of combining
them all together to I don't know make a
decision right that's exactly right and
by the way if you think about something
like decision trees you can there's
really a sort of similar problem going
on there we could think of each of the
nodes and a decision tree as being a
very simple rule and the decision tree
tells us how to combine them right so we
need to figure out how to do that here
and that is the fundamental notion of
ensemble learning well wait isn't
couldn't you also do something similar
with something like neural net right
where each of these now becomes a
feature and we're just trying to learn
weights for combining them all together
so that would kind of satisfy what you
were talking about true I mean I think
the difference here in this case and and
I think you're absolutely right but one
difference here is that typically with
the neural network we've already built
the network itself and the nodes and
we're trying to learn the weights
whereas in something like a decision
tree you're building up rules as you go
along
and typically with ensemble learning
you're building up a bunch of rules and
combining them together until you've got
something that's good enough but you're
absolutely right you could think of
neural networks as being an ensemble of
little parts sometimes hard to
understand but an ensemble nonetheless</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
