in mind one of the most important for
purposes of this class is it was
designed to provide data transfer that's
platform independent what does that mean
well the idea here is that you can have
a producer app that's written in any
programming language on any operating
system and any type of hardware and a
consumer app implemented in any other
programming language operating system or
hardware there is no binding between how
the consumer app or the producer app is
implemented because they both agree to
speak XML to one another and of course
in addition to consuming XML from the
producer app the consumer I'd also write
xml to the producer app another
important goal for XML is that it would
be easy to write programs to read and
write xml the designers also wanted a
data format that could be validated so
in XML we write a specification for a
particular type of document and then any
specific examples of that document that
are produced can be validated against
that specification so biomed central has
a specification for the research article
format and any articles that are
produced are validated against that
format to ensure they adhere to the
rules for that data model XML is
designed to be human readable and as we
saw in the example we can get a pretty
good idea of what information is
contained within an XML encoding just by
looking at it and finally XML is
designed to support a wide variety of
applications we've seen one application
of XML we're going to take a look at
several others that essentially span a
number of different ways in which XML
can be applied to exchanging data
between applications if you're in more
information about this data format I
encourage you to take a look at the w3c
site we're going to talk a little bit
about what having a standard means one
of the most important benefits of there
being an XML standard is that we have
robust parsers in most programming
languages Python included what this
means for us as data scientists is that
we get to focus on our own applications
we don't have to worry about writing
parsers for some ad hoc data format
previously each messaging system had its
own format and all were different which
made the type of messaging that we do
now
very messy complex and expensive to do
if everyone uses the same syntax it
makes writing these systems a lot faster
and much more reliable another advantage
for XML is that it's free now that's
free as in beer but also free from legal
encumbrances it's not a format that any
company owns and may change out from
under us xml information can be
manipulated programmatically so we can
build databases to support specific
types of queries or we can piece
together data from different sources or
take it apart to be reused in different
ways xml documents can also be reliably
converted into other formats with no
loss of information XML lets you
separate form or appearance from content
so your xml file contains your document
information all of your text and data
and identifies its structure formatting
and other processing needs are
identified separately in a style sheet
or processing system in the biomed
central example it is actually that xml
that is transformed into HTML for
rendering on the website or into PDF for
download using a stylesheet and style
sheet processing system the two are
combined it output time to apply the
required formatting to the text or data
identified by its structure this
structure might define location position
order or any other aspects of the data</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
