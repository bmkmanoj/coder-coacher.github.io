problem the thing we've been trying to
solve this whole unit so as you remember
we have the sun's rays striking
perpendicular to the earth here at CNA
we assume that these rays all came in
parallel like I've drawn here and here
in Alexandria which is north of CNA
there is no longer strike the earth
perpendicular to the surface of the
earth they strike at this angle alpha we
showed before that must be equal to this
angle alpha as well and by comparing the
full angular measure of a circle 360
degrees to this portion alpha we are
able to find that if we knew D and we
knew alpha we could calculate the
circumference of the earth we got D by
timing a camels distance from CNA to
Alexandria now we just need to find
alpha to determine this angle alpha
let's imagine what it would be like to
be standing here in Alexandria well if I
were actually standing there I can now
say the earth is flat because I don't
notice the curvature of the earth on a
daily basis and I can imagine sticking
some sort of pole onto the ground and
maybe I know the length of this pole now
I know the sun's rays are coming in at a
certain angle I'm gonna draw the Rays in
red just to make it a little easier to
see so here come the sun's rays you can
tell they're being blocked by the pole
in some places so where the pole blocks
the sun's rays we get a shadow here's
the show here's the pole shadow and now
you can see we're almost there you can
see the right triangle that's emerged we
have the sun's ray that just barely
missed the edge of the pole we've the
shadow of the pole we have the pole
itself forming a right triangle now from
this drawing you can actually see that
the angle we called alpha if I imagine
making a perpendicular line here
perpendicular to the earth this is the
angle we call the Alpha that's no
problem that's also equal to this angle
alpha and now we're almost there
so here's our triangle with three sides
one two three opposite adjacent to alpha
and hypotenuse and we just need to know
what this angle is now that we have our
right triangle
we just need to consult a trigonometric
table and we should be able to figure
out what alpha is and what the
circumference of the earth is so we've
set up the experiment we have our
vertical bar with its shadow and what
Eratosthenes data may have looked like
was that the length of the bar would
have been something around 1 meter and
the length of the shadow about 0.1 to 6
meters which is 12 point six centimeters
he of course had access to his
trigonometric tables and here's a
portion of one such table now can you
put yourself in Eratosthenes shoes and
tell me what is the value of alpha</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
