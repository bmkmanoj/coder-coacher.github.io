construct a basic timing device using a
block bouncing back and forth between
two Springs so imagine that we have two
Springs here each with a spring constant
k1 attached to this wall over here and
one attached to this wall over here and
the middle we have a block that's
freedom bounce between the two of these
over this frictionless surface here and
the separation between the two Springs
equilibrium distance is three meters as
shown here now right in the middle of
the three meters here is a little switch
which connects to a timer over here and
every time the block moves over the
switch in either direction it sends a
signal to the timer telling it that one
second has passed so as an extra point
of clarification this switch is 1.5
meters from either spring so I want you
to tell me what does this initial
velocity v-0 have to be such that every
time the block passes over the switch
here a second has actually passed in
other words we want to choose V 0 such
that the time it takes the block to push
up against this spring and bounce back
to this same spot again will be one
second exactly so you can put your
answer over here in meters per second
now there's one thing in particular that
might trip you up with this problem if
you imagine that this block was attached
to this spring then the block would push
against the spring in one fourth of a
period return to the equilibrium
position in half a period extend
outwards in three fourths of a period
and finally returned to the equilibrium
position once again after an entire
period but keep in mind that the block
is not actually attached to the spring
so this point where the block extends
outward and is pulled backwards by the
spring actually never happens in fact
the block loses contact with a spring at
this point right here when it has
maximum velocity at the equilibrium
position so keep that in mind when
you're solving the problem good luck</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
