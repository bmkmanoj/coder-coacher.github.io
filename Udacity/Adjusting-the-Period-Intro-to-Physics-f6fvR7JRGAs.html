ceiling on a spring with the spring
constant K if I started shaking up and
down oscillating we know it will move
with a certain period how do we adjust
that period well let me first tell you
the force law of a spring and to do this
it actually might be better to think of
this spring being horizontal so here's
our spring at its normal happy
equilibrium position we're going to call
the equilibrium position x equals 0 now
let's see when we stretch this spring a
bit when we move the mass back to let's
say here to some position X well the
spring exerts a force backwards back
towards the equilibrium so the force of
the spring is somehow negative if I pull
to the right it pulls to the left and in
fact if I pull further to the right it
pulls harder to the left if you've ever
pulled on a spring you can tell pulling
it a little bit as easy pulling it more
is more difficult so actually the force
is proportional to how much you stretch
it and what's the constant of
proportionality well that's why we have
this letter K so this is the force on a
spring and we know from our good buddy
Newton that forces cause accelerations
in this case the spring will accelerate
this way due to this spring force so why
don't we replace this F with this minus
KX well in that case we get ma equals
minus KX and so a equals negative k over
m times x now i hope you follow it along
so far the acceleration is equal to
minus K over m times x reason why i say
i hope you followed along is because
unfortunately now i have to do something
that i hate to do I have to just tell
you something and that something is that
whenever you can write a force law like
this that the acceleration is equal to
minus something times X times its
displacement from its equilibrium well
it turns out that this something is
always equal to Omega squared and
remember Omega is our radians per second
our angular frequency now let's say you
have a spring spring concept 50 Newtons
per meter and let's say you want your
period to be equal to 1 second remember
period is equal to 2 pi over omega and
why do we want one second well we're
trying to design a clock here of course
we want a 1 second period we want to
talk to talk so the question is with
this spring in this desired period what
mass do we need enter your answer here
in kilograms</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
