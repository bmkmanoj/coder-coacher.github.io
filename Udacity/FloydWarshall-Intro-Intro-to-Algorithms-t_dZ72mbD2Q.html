an algorithm called floyd-warshall after
two of the inventors of this algorithm
back in the early 60s and it uses an
idea called dynamic programming which
sounds so much cooler than it actually
is so that being said it actually is a
very cool idea I have a professor friend
who believes that I am predisposed to
see all problems as dynamic programming
problems because it's a it's a it's a
algorithm an algorithm design technique
that I have been able to use
successfully and a bunch of occasions
but it really is just an algorithm
design technique it's not particularly
dynamic and it doesn't really change the
way you think about programming it just
has to do with optimizing using tables
all right so let me start off by
explaining this algorithm in terms of
simple but possibly strange idea so
first just for simplicity let's imagine
all the nodes in our graph are numbered
from 0 to n minus 1 and lots of graphs
that is exactly how they're structured
but for example for our Marvel data set
we'd have to have all our characters be
assigned numbers from 0 to n minus 1 but
it's an easy thing to do let's imagine
that's already been done what we're
going to imagine now is that someone has
given us this matrix square matrix d sub
K and the entries of this matrix it's
just a big table like a spreadsheet and
it's filled in with values as follows so
the IJ element the eighth row j DH
column is filled in with a number and
that number is the length of the
shortest path from I to J hopping only
on nodes numbered less than K so I don't
know about you but I used to play a game
like this when I was younger if I was in
a building where the tiles were
different colors I'd sometimes declare
oh let's say the blue tiles are
alligators so I'm not going to step on
any of the blue tiles and I'd try to you
know walk stepping only on the tiles
that I was allowed to use so that the
analog of this in the graph is imagined
we've got our graph we're trying to get
a path from I to J and some of the nodes
are colored pink those are the ok nodes
because they are numbered less than K
and some of the nodes maybe even
including J itself are numbered higher
than K and we're not allowed to step on
those so we're trying to get from I to J
we're allowed to step on J obviously but
only the intermediate nodes that are
pink so we only consider making paths
along pink nodes and there's only one in
this case but there's some pink nodes
that we don't use
and there may be multiple different pink
paths but we want to know the distance
of the shortest path using only the pink
nodes only the ones that are numbered
less than K so let's imagine someone
very helpfully has done this for us and
filled filled in the matrix with all
those values there's big theta of N
squared values that have to get filled
in but someone's done that for us that's
all great our mission should we choose
to accept it is to fill in DK plus 1 so
this will be a new matrix just like the
old matrix but now when you're going on
a path from I to J you're allowed to use
node k you don't have to use it but
you're allowed so that's all we have to
do right now is try to figure out if
someone gives us DK how do we figure out
DK plus 1</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
