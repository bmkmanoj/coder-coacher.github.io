two functions up hash table update a
hash table lookup use some similar
functionality that instead we could
place in a separate procedure looking at
the hash table update and look up
procedures here we see code that's
identical between them namely these two
lines in both functions these two lines
of code go through a given bucket
searching for an entry whose first value
is the key and so what we're going to do
is we want to take this code and move it
into a separate helper function this is
known as refactoring refactoring is a
common software engineering practice
where we change the code without
changing the functionality there's a
number of reasons to do so for example
here we're doing to minimize duplicated
code this is desirable because if we
want to change how these two lines of
code work perhaps we change the
structure of the bucket we don't want to
look through every hash table function
searching for how this works and
updating them rather we just want to
update it in one place this minimizes
bugs and saves time so let's give it a
try here I've created a new function
called bucket find you should see that
it's very similar to the code that we
have an update and look up and that
we're going to go through the bucket
searching for the entry whose first
value is the key and then returning the
entire entry so that we can use it
accordingly in both update and look up
so now that we have the helper function
let's change our hash table functions to
use it the resulting code is going to be
both simpler and shorter I've changed
hash table update we find the bucket in
the first line then within the bucket
where was searching for the key and if
we find that entry we're going to update
the value otherwise we're going to
append the key and the value to the end
of the bucket it looks quite a bit
simpler than the original function let's
do the same thing to look up in the new
hash table lookup we first find the
bucket and then within the bucket we're
certain we searched for the entry if the
entries not none we return the second
value otherwise we return none</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
