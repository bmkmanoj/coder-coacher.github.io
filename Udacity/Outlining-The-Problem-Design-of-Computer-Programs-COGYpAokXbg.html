how to write a poker program and this is
going to be an example of a general
process where we start with a vague
understanding and then we refine our
understanding to have a formal
specification of a problem then we
specify that into something that is
amenable to being coded and then the
design process we end up with working
code so we'll follow these steps 1 2 3
now the first thing I want to do in the
understanding phase is make an inventory
of the concepts that we're going to have
to deal with and so let's look at what
we have first we have this notion of
hands a hand consists of five cards so
here's an individual card and a card has
a rank and a suit and this card the 5 of
diamonds the rank is 5 and the suit is
diamonds so the main program we're
trying to specify we'll call a poker and
it takes a list of hands as input and
returns the best hand now what's the
best hand well you can see the rules of
Poker there are links to describe where
where we can look them up and we'll go
over them briefly throughout the course
of this video but we can say for example
that this hand it's called two pair you
can also say it's Jack's over twos
with an extra five and the rules specify
which hands beat which which is the best
ranking for each hand so this is another
concept that we have the concept of a
hand rank which takes a hand and maps to
something like in this case two pair and
maybe with some more details and what
are the concepts that make up the hand
rank well there are three one is the
concept of cards of the same rank the
same kind and we'll call that n of a
kind for two of a kind three of a kind
of four of a kind so here I have two of
a kind in tutus and in two jacks this
hand is a straight five six seven eight
nine because it's five consecutive ranks
suits don't matter and then
the notion of a flush this hand is a
flush because all five cards have the
same suit and the ranks don't matter so
there are few more details about the
ranking you can look it up on the links
see the Wikipedia article on poker hands
but now I think we're ready well we know
about the types of data we have to deal
with hands cards ranks and suits and we
know about the sort of operations or
functions on them now we're ready to
move into the design phase</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
