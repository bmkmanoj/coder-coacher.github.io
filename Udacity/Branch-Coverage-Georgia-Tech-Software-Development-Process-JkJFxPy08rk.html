let's see what how we can get into
account that else part that is missing
in our example code by introducing a new
kind of coverage branch coverage as
usual I'm going to describe branch
coverage in terms of test requirements
and coverage measure so starting from
test requirements the test requirements
for branch coverage are the branches in
the program in other words the goal of
branch coverage is to execute all of the
branches in the program the coverage
measure is defined accordingly as the
number of branches executed by my test
cases over the total number of branches
in the program and let me remind you
that branches are the outgoing edges
from a decision point therefore an if
statement as which statement a while
statement any node in the CFG that has
got more than one outgoing edge those
edges are called branches so let's look
at that using our example so now we're
looking back at our for in some example
and in addition to the code I also want
to represent the CFG for the program so
let's start by looking at how many
branches we have in our code which means
how many test requirements we have in
this case there are two decision points
the first one that corresponds to the
first if and the second one that
corresponds to the second if so we have
one two three and four branches so now
let's bring back our current set of test
cases we had two test cases the ones
with which we achieved 100% statement
coverage and let's see what happens in
terms of branch coverage when we run
these test cases start from the first
one when we execute it we follow the
code we get to this decision point
because the predicate in the if
statements is true we follow the true
branch and therefore we get here and
then we exit from the program so in this
case we cover one of the branches which
means that we get to 25% coverage now
when we run the second test case again
we follow this path we get to this the
first if in this case the predicate of
the if is false therefore we go this way
where is the second predicate the second
if the result is true so we follow the
true branch and therefore we cover this
additional two branches so at this point
we are at 75% branch coverage so what
happened is that we're missing this
branch for none of the input that we
consider this branch is executed
therefore we need to add an additional
test case and that this case that we
need is one for which this predicate is
false and this predicate is false the
simplest possibility
in this case is the test case for which
a is equal to zero and B is equal to
zero if we execute this test case our
execution again followed these paths
follow the false branch here and in this
case because result is not less than
zero either we'll follow this branch as
well and therefore we will reach our
100% branch coverage and discovered the
problem something that I would like to
clarify before we move to the next topic
is that 100% coverage does not provide
any guarantee of finding the problems in
the code all we saw so far is defected
by testing more thoroughly we have more
chances of finding a problem in the code
but it doesn't matter which kind of
coverage we utilize and how much
coverage we achieve there's always a
chance that we might miss something and
I will get back to this later on in the
lesson I just mentioned the fact that we
tested more thoroughly when we went from
statement coverage to branch coverage
what does that mean exactly to explain
that I'm going to introduce the concept
of test criteria subsumption one test
criterion subsumes another criteria when
all the test suites that satisfy that
criterion will also satisfy the other
one so let me show you that with
statement and branch coverage if we
identify a test suite that achieves 100%
branch coverage the same test weight
will also achieve necessarily under
percent statement coverage that's what
happened for our example and also what
happens in general because branch
coverage is a stronger criterion than
statement coverage there is no way to
cover all the branches without covering
all the statements it is not true that
any test way that will satisfy statement
coverage will also satisfy branch
coverage and in fact we just saw a
counter example when we look at the
print some code we had a test with the
words achieve 900% statement coverage
and was not achieving under percent
branch coverage therefore in this case
we have a substantial relation in this
direction branch coverage subsumes
statement coverage what it also means is
that normally or in general it is more
expensive to achieve branch coverage
than the chip statement coverage because
achieving branch coverage requires the
generation of a larger number of test
cases so what this relation means is
that branch coverage is stronger than
statement coverage but also more
expensive</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
