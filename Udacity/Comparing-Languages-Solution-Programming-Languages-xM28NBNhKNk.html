together when I run this program we
start out with X being zero and then
this while loop says as long as true is
true keep incrementally as one two three
four five we never actually get to this
line about the print so does this
program print zero not so much control
flow goes here here here then back and
we stay in this while loop forever it
doesn't print out this huge number four
billion 294 million nine hundred 67,000
296 know which is I think pretty close
to let's say two to the 32 this is a
reasonable guess if you think oh the
integer is going to max out at some
value based on computer hardware but no
there's a thought that it raises an
exception some badly made Python
interpreters might raise an exception on
this but it should not if we had lots of
computing resources this would run
forever and similarly it also never
prints out negative one the correct
answer is none of these things it loops
forever all right so if this program
naturally loops forever and we're
writing an interpreter that exactly
simulates this program by following all
of its steps our interpreter is also
going to loop forever someone had
written this program in java script and
put it in the middle of a web page our
web browser would loop forever and never
actually render the resulting web page</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
