have so many things to teach them yeah
she'll be cover you know hold that pipe
I need something are you going here
this is for you thank you let's just
poured out some beans up what are you
doing well these are not our beans but
let's just imagine they are folks okay
okay I just want to create a little
coffee trail which is going to be a
symbol of the journey our students will
take with us okay let's just say this is
our student and this is where they are
beginning
oh and then this can be where they end
right which is where they are an Android
developer Yeah right and we're focusing
on just this part of our course right
now right so this is where we are so I'm
just gonna clean it out and zoom in into
the main part of the course okay well
let's say there are three big lessons in
this course only three let's say there
are three for now yeah um so this is
lesson 1 2 &amp;amp; 3 um let's talk about
lesson 1 um I'm just gonna zoom in there
and clean it out fast yeah um well I'm
gonna split this forward and do three
sections and you might guess what my
favorite number is at this point which
is 2/3 okay um what is the first thing
we should do in lesson 1
I think they should learn about views
views things that you see on the phone
so like a check box a radio button an
image a text of some sort exact so we
introduced them to that here in the
second part of lesson 1 then we can
learn to customize those views oh okay
so you're changing the color of a font
or size of an image exactly and then
part 3 we should teach them how to
position views on a screen so it's like
bottom left or top right or where is it
going on the phone screen yeah so let's
begin at the beginning the first thing
in Android you need to know is something
called views views</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
