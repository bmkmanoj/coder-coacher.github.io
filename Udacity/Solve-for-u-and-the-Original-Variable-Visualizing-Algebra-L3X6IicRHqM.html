nice solving if you found these two
fractions we can replace you with what
it equals from our substitution for M
minus 3 so this you becomes 4 and minus
3 and this u becomes 4-3 as well next we
add 3 to both sides of the equation to
get form equals negative 5 halves plus 3
&amp;amp; 4 M equals to hear I want to combine
these two together so this added
together should be positive one-half if
I haven't convinced you then think about
what we can change 3 into we can change
what this number looks like by writing
it as a fraction 3 is the same as 6
divided by 2 so really we have negative
5 halves plus six apps will have one
more positive half on this side than we
do negative halves so these added
together will give us positive one-half
finally we divide by 4 on both sides of
the equations to get M is equal to
one-half times the fourth NM is equal to
one-half I know this is true since when
we divide by a number we can really
multiply it by its reciprocal so when
half divided by 4 is one half times one
fourth and we know that really equals 18
so one eighth is one solution and one
half is the other</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
