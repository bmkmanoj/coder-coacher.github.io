thing we're gonna note is that if each
of these things could be represented by
a bag of vectors maxover bag of vectors
then all the other ones can be
represented as maxover bag of vectors so
the easiest one is the very first one
the first one says that the value
function at time step T is the max over
actions of some other kind of thing if
this is represented as the max of a
bunch of dot products over belief states
then think about what happens if you
just take all the vectors for all the
different actions and throw them into
one big bag so imagine that we've got
you know one set of vectors that
represents a value function and then we
have another set of vectors this is for
one particular action then we have a set
of vectors that represent the value
function for a different action call it
a two so the thing to note is that the
max over the max is the max over the the
bag of vectors this upper surface here
is actually the right thing that if the
if a1 gives the the highest answer in
one case then we get that if a2 gives a
higher answer in another case we get
that we can just pull all the vectors
together so this is just a union over
all actions of the bag of vectors for
each of those actions this is a way of
writing max as an operation over sets of
vectors sure I believe that that'll make
sense the next piece is that the value
function for an action a time step T for
belief state B we said that it was the
sum over observations of some particular
vector that we get for that observation
if these can be represented using bags
of vectors then this sum over
observations can also be represented
using operations over bags of vectors
and in particular what we end up having
to do is take those bags of vectors and
compute what I like to call across some
it's basically the sum where we choose
for each of the observations we choose a
vector and then we add those vectors
together it ends up producing the same
effect as this sum so what we're doing
here is now given a set of vectors one
set for each action observation pair
we're gonna create a bag of vectors just
for an action by taking this sort of
cross sum summing out all the different
observations because that's really what
we're doing we're summing up over the
observations so that's just really a
fancy way of writing what you just wrote
yeah but again it's it's letting us go
from
function V which is over an infinite
state space be to just a finite set of
vectors we have a set of vectors and we
generate from that a new finite set of
vectors so in this case the number of
vectors this first step the number of
vectors is the sum of the size of the
sum number of vectors in all the sets
gamma 80 here we're actually multiplying
so it's the product of the sizes of all
these sets which is finite but it could
get actually quite big I guess now that
you say that we should say out loud that
you're making assumptions that
everything else is finite - like the
number of actions and things like that
sure
that's that was already built into the
definition of MDPs the way we were
talking about them fair enough but yeah
it's probably worth repeating that
certainly if the number of actions is
infinite then this is problematic this
already this this Union is problematic
and if the number of observations is
infinite then this cross sum is
problematic
so all but yeah we're finite state space
finite action space finite observation
space okay so I'm getting the idea
basically that if you can start out with
something finite and every step of the
way you might grow but you're never
gonna grow an infinite amount in a
single step and therefore so long as the
number of steps is finite or bounded or
some word like that you will maintain a
finite number of things in your bag
that's kind of what you're doing step by
step
okay that's what we're going and and
yeah and if it feels like there could be
a lot of vectors this is true it
actually can grow doubly exponentially
with T the the number of iterations of
value duration we're doing but for now
we're pretending that's not a problem
yeah I mean look exponential is bad
unless you're comparing at the infinite
that's right that's right we set things
up so that exponential is actually
awesome yeah cuz it's finite</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
