dot Swift file and the first thing I
want you to do is delete any code that's
in the roll the dice method here in this
method we're going to present our custom
view controller so how are we going to
do that we might as well start by trying
to present it the same way we did the UI
kit view controllers so in that case we
just construct our dice view controller
and then present it oh but also we need
to set those dice values so let's do
that in these two lines okay let's see
if it runs okay so far so good oh hmm
got a problem what does the console say
okay fatal error unexpectedly found nil
while unwrapping an optional value okay
so the green highlighting is pointing to
the first dye property and we know if
the first I property is nil that's going
to cause a runtime error because first I
is an implicitly unwrapped optional so
why is first I know if we look back at
our object diagram we're reminded that
these outlets to our views were created
in storyboard we created this instance
of dice view controller without
storyboard so that means these outlets
these views and this action don't exist
yet so that's a problem so in order to
get rid of this error we need to get a
fully assembled dice view controller
from storyboard so let's close the
console and then go back into our role
view controller dot Swift file so here's
where we were presenting our dice view
controller before in the roll the dice
method you go ahead and delete this
reference to the dice view controller
and we're going to replace it in this
line first we get a reference to a
storyboard object and then we ask for
the dice view controller by name using
its story board identifier let's take a
closer look at this new method
instantiate view controller with
identifier this identifier is just a
string it's the name that you give the
view controller and storyboard so let's
double check that we actually set that
name in storyboard so if I open up the
storyboard file and click on the dice
view controller I can look in the
utilities pane and click on the identity
inspector in the identity inspector
right here you'll see the storyboard
identifier and we can see that yes
indeed it is set to dice view controller
just for kicks
I'm going to go ahead and delete this
storyboard ID and the class ID and see
what would happen if you forgot to put
the name of the view controller now
let's try and run it okay so it compiles
fine roll the dice Oh terminating with
uncaught exception okay so if you get
one of these exception errors what you
want to do is scroll up to the top of
the console and then you'll get more
information about the air and here we
can see storyboard doesn't contain a
view controller with identifier dice
view controller so that's pretty much
what we expected but we know how to fix
that we'll just go back in the
storyboard and reset the name there that
ought to do it now let's go back into
our role view controller dot Swift file
because I want to point out one more
thing about that instantiate view
controller with identify our method
what's going on at the end of this line
here where it says dice view controller
as dice view controller if you alt click
on this method you can see that it
returns any object that's why we need to
cast that returned object as a dice view
controller</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
