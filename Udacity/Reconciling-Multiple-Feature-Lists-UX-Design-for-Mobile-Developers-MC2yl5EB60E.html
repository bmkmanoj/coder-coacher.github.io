create an awesome pizza application on
Android and now we've ended up with
three feature lists yours mine and yours
so what is the best set of features to
end up in this perfect app so this is a
really common problem that you as a
developer have probably faced over and
over again you have all these really
great ideas so which ones are gonna go
into your feature lists I can totally
see a lot of people wanting to order the
same thing every time and I can also see
a lot of people wanting to order fresh
new things so what are our two main
options here
what is our slopes there's two things we
do one is we could actually combine all
the features and end up with an
application that has nine features so
maybe accommodating everyone's
perspectives into account and/or
another thing we could do is we could
just pick one so basically pick either
your mine or your feature list and go
with that so these are really both bad
options because if you were to combine
one or more of these feature lists
you're gonna kind of have an application
that doesn't really please anyone when
you try to please everyone you end up
pleasing no one yeah exactly and if you
were to just pick one application that
maybe would represent you or you how do
you know how many people out there
actually have those same attributes you
could be missing out on a lot of
different things so how do we solve this
if both of these are not that good of an
option well this is where a user centric
design comes in we design a product with
a specific user in mind so one of the
keys to user centric design is
overcoming our own biases so what we've
experienced here is preference bias that
our own preferences are really being put
directly into a feature list and we're
not designing for a user we're just
designing for ourselves so next we're
going to learn about another bias that
we really need to be aware of</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
