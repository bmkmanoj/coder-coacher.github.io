and fifth would be odd rows and the
second and fourth would be even rows but
how would we generalize this to figure
this out let's look at a couple more
examples if the total number of rows was
six then even rows would be three and
odd rows would also be three if the
number of rows was seven then odd rows
would be four and even rows would still
be three so it looks like the number of
odd rows is something like half of the
total number of rows but four isn't
exactly half of seven over two it would
be half of seven plus one over two what
would happen if we added one on to this
six as well then we would get seven over
two which in Java land for integers is
still three for the even rows 6 over 2
is 3 that one works and 7 over 2 is
pretty close to 3 in Java and that's
three so if I just divide by 2 and throw
away the remainder it looks like I get
the number of even rows if you don't
believe me you can try a few more
examples so it looks like the total
number of odd rows is the total number
of rows plus 1 over 2 and then drop the
decimal whereas the number of even rows
is just the total number of rows over 2
and we drop the decimal there's another
way you could calculate the odd rows you
could say that the odd rows are always
the total number of rows divided by 2
and then you add 1 if the total number
of rows is odd so that would be the
total number over 2 plus 1 if 7 is odd
and if 7 is odd then 7 mod 2 would be 1
so total mod to save these for later and
you could also try this one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
