try to solve P versus NP there's a
webpage called the P versus NP page and
that page lists a lot of the attempts
that have been made to settle the P
versus NP question the list which you
find on this web page as you can see is
very very very long the list contains
almost a hundred papers of which when I
check that the last time
41 claimed that P equals NP and 46
claims that P does not equal NP so we
already know that half of these proofs
are wrong but of course none of them is
accepted in any way none of them has
ever been published in a scientific
journal so we can almost safely assume
that the proofs that these papers all
claim to have do not hold up against
scientific scrutiny and some of those
proofs are actually quite huge for
example there was a recent attempt to
show that P does not equal NP which used
up 102 pages which is almost a full
Udacity course and you know why it
didn't work out a flaw on page number 67
and it is for these reasons that in fact
many computer scientists will nowadays
refuse to even look at your proof of P
equals NP or P does not equal NP unless
you can convince them that you've had a
new insight that hasn't been discussed
before so the status of P versus NP is
this despite over 40 years of research a
million-dollar prize and many computer
science heavyweights having attempted to
resolve P versus NP there are so far be
no solution and it has even been shown
and unfortunately we can't go deeper
into that that some common mathematical
tools that are used in theoretical
computer science are not capable of
solving this question so not only do you
need to have a good idea for proof but
you also need to invent new techniques
for theoretical computer science so I do
not want to discourage you from thinking
about P versus NP but don't quit your
day job to attempt to resolve this
question so let's do our final quiz in
this unit when or under what
circumstances should you try to settle
the P versus NP question is it when you
think you've had a brilliant insight is
it when you've had a brilliant insight
and you have made sure that this
been tried before or is it when you've
had a brilliant insight that you've made
sure no one has tried before and you
know that your proof technique is
actually capable of setting the P versus
NP question or is it when you are a
seasoned and respected computer
scientist with nothing to lose and
enough money or savings to sustain
yourself so please check all of the
correct ones</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
