and he points out that pythons of
flexible language we can use many
different programming paradigms we can
functional procedural object-oriented
program and programming how do you
decide which of these paradigms to use
when approaching a new problem yeah I
guess I try to think of things as how
can I get as close to the problem as
possible and so I want to program at the
level of the problem and then
incidentally I have to program with a
particular language and so I start
analyzing the problem and saying what
are the pieces of this of this problem
what are the objects are going to be
manipulating what are the ways i'm going
to manipulate them and and try to do
most analysis at that level and then
once that analysis is done then i can
say but what do I have in my programming
language and and there there might be
some differences between languages so if
you're using Python you might have more
functions if you're using Java you might
have more classes but they're still
implementing the same basic set of ideas
and I like that approach because there's
a more direct connection between the
problem in the solution rather than a
multi-step of going from the problem to
the language implementation and then
back to the solution all right thank you
that's all we had for this week uh see
you next week alright see you in the
knife lecture</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
