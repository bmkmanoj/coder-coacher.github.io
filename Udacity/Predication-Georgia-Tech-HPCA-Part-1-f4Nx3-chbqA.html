try to deal with control hazards
unlike branch prediction when we are
really trying to guess which way the
if-then-else or a loop or something
branch will be going predication is
another way for dealing with control
dependencies branch friction is about
guessing where the program is going
usually there is no penalty for being
correct in branch friction pretty much
we just keep fetching as if the branch
wasn't even there even if the branch is
actually taken we can just keep fetching
from the right place and thus avoid any
penalty but the problem with branch
friction is that in modern processors
there is a huge penalty if we are wrong
in predicting keep in mind that modern
processors have a deep pipe with lots of
stages before the one in which we figure
out the misprediction and in each stage
we have a number of instructions that we
have been doing so a misprediction
results in throwing away all of that
work usually at least several tens of
instructions worth of work so the
penalty is usually zero instructions
here and if we have something like maybe
a 12 stage pipeline with four
instructions per cycle we're talking
about something like forty eighth
possibly instructions or so so let's say
about fifty instructions worth of work
wasted predication is about doing work
of the both of the directions so we
basically do the work of both of taken
and not taken direction for a branch
that way the waste is up to 50 percent
of the work we've been doing because at
the position where the branch was
supposed to be about half of the stuff
we've been fetching could have been from
one path half of the stuff was from the
other and only half of that work will
actually be used the rest will be thrown
away and then we simply throw away the
work from the wrong path so what is good
about this it seems like here if we are
correct we lose nothing if we are wrong
we lose a lot but we can have very
accurate prediction well here either way
lose quite a bit well let's see how the
branch friction and something like
predication compare on different types
of conditional branches that we might
want to predict for a loop usually we
want to do branch friction loop branches
the more iterations we have the more
they are predictable whereas with
predication in each iteration of the
loop we will be dividing our work into
two one is do the next iteration the
other one is do the work after the loop
so if we to have a thousand iterations
very little of the work will end up
being done correctly simply the branch
is diverging too much when we need to
decide whether to stay in the loop or
not we will be starting the work of both
of these one path goes after the loop
the other one goes back into the loop
and then here we have a decision again
to follow that path or stay in the loop
death path stay in the loop so after a
while if we are still doing the work of
all of these paths concurrently a very
small fraction of the work we are doing
ends up being the staying in the loop
work and a lot of it has to do with
various variants of exiting the loop in
each iteration so for a loop we want to
predict function call returns same thing
except predication really makes no sense
because calls and returns always go
there so somehow the direction of not
going there makes no sense to do so we
want to predict let's say now we have a
large if-then-else so what happens we
have a decision and based on it we do
this or we do this now the question is
should we try to predict this decision
or predicate so that we are doing the
work of both and eventually they will
merge and we continue and the answer
here is that if we predict we waste up
to 50 instructions more likely we waste
nothing if we predicate
and these branches have equal weight
then let's say we have a hundred
instructions here and a hundred
instructions here we will execute two
hundred instructions waste a hundred of
them either way so somehow the amount of
waste with predication here is larger
than even the penalty of branch
misprediction pretty much if we predict
and we are right we lose nothing if
we're predicting we are wrong we lose 50
instructions here we lose a hundred
instructions and we cannot be wrong or
right but either way we are losing a
hundred instructions so for a large
if-then-else it seems like we should be
predicting not let's see how things look
like for a small if-then-else let's say
that we have a decision to make
and depending on the decision we have
the then or the else path but let's say
each is now something like five
instructions long now it becomes
interesting if we do predication we will
be executing ten instructions here
followed by instructions that we would
do anyway so the waste is 5 instructions
either way here we are predicting and if
we are right we waste nothing but if we
are wrong we waste 50 instructions so
our comparison is that 100% of the time
we waste 5 instructions with predication
so we end up with 5 on average per
instance of this whereas here our branch
prediction rate determines how often we
waste this 50 so it's gonna be let's say
zero point ten because it's 10 percent
probability of miss predicting in which
case we end up at five two so if our
accuracy of prediction is ninety percent
or better than in this case we are
better off predicting the branch but if
our accuracy is less than ninety percent
we are better off predicating if the if
then else is even smaller than it biases
things more in favor of predication and
less in favor of branch prediction so
for really small if the analysis we want
to predicate unless we are reasonably
sure that their branch friction is gone
be highly accurate</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
