teeny bit more about ways we can trace
through our maternal or paternal lines
so in the case of mitochondrial DNA we
only inherit that from our mothers so
you can trace your maternal line back
through the mitochondrial DNA the
mitochondria have been passed down from
generation to generation from
great-great-great grandmother to great
grade to grade to grandmother to mother
to you now the same thing is true for
the Y chromosome for males every male is
genetically XY and he had to have gotten
that Y chromosome from his father who
got it from his father who got it from
his father who got it from his father
and so this Y chromosome has just been
passed down from generation to
generation through all of the male line
one of the big distinctions here is that
mitochondrial DNA everybody has but the
Y chromosome only males have we're gonna
revisit these concepts a little bit
later in lesson seven when we actually
try to trace an individual's lineage on
both his mother's and father's side</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
