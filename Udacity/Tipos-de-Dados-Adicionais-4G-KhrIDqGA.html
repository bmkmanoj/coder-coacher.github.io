listening that flow chart our tables or
simply just text and maps a table is in
traditionally thought of as a tool for
visualization but sometimes if your data
doesn't have any inherent structure or
order at tables the most natural choice
tables typically are used to represent
summaries of data or somewhat disjointed
in this example we'll be looking at
states and their corresponding state
bird since states do have some
geographical representation we may want
to represent them on a map but since
state bird is simply a label or category
it may be hard to represent in one of
the other visual encodings that
correspond with the geographic map
typically with a map you have either the
size or color of some geographic region
or some points to plot in our case we
simply want to look up which state and
find the corresponding state bird tables
work well when there is no one here in
relation between the data you're
conveying since we simply want a state
through state bird mapping we can use a
table as something of a lookup mechanism
maps are interesting because they are
something of a compound visual encoding
a map is simply an axe in a y-coordinate
combined with some geographic context
often in the case of latitude and
longitude and when combined we get a
mapping of an X and a y pixel coordinate
through some latitude and longitude
which equals a map I quickly wanted to
go over one of my favorite
visualizations due to its simplicity and
power by Dustin cable from the Weldon
Cooper Center for Public Service with
this visualization we have many visual
encodings going on in the same space
every point on the map is actually one
person from the US census the color of
the dot corresponds to their race as
reported on the census and the x and y
pixel position of the map correspond to
the latitude and longitude of the census
block from which the person reported
their race what's truly stunning what
this visualization is that nowhere in
the graphic our state or city borders
drawn the natural structure
of the United States and the population
density across the United States
naturally falls out of the fact that
every dot represents a person and most
the people united states are reported on
the census the map way of drawn here
only uses two visual encodings the x and
y coordinate for position and one visual
encoding the color for the race there
are just a few other Geographic charts
that I want to talk about a choropleth
map represents some value by color and
plots it geographically across a region
typically you may see this as states of
the united states which have a different
color representing the intensity of some
value going back to the previous example
of unemployment we might represent the
unemployment of every state as some
range of colors a map that's very
similar to a choropleth but uses a
different visual encoding to encode its
value is a cartogram a cartogram
represents some geographic data and uses
the size of the geographic region to
encode often some continuous value again
going back to the unemployment example
rather than representing the
unemployment rate of a state by its
color with a choropleth we can represent
it by the size of the state geographic
region that we draw in just reviewing
what we just covered with the dot map a
dot map could actually represent any
shape in the case of the example I've
shown it was similar to a scatterplot
where we represent our data with circles
and how it corresponds to some
Geographic change the map we just went
over is an interesting combination of a
choropleth and a dot map in a way since
it uses some geographic data with a
shape in our case a circle and some
color to encode another secondary value
for each point and as always there are
many other chart types that will not
cover here but are typically some sort
of compound chart and the way a
choropleth or cartogram combines
elements from two simpler chart types in
the resources section of the class you
can find an exhaustive list of most
every common chart type that people use</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
