Left we have the original model that the
model is sort of a time and we're going
to call that zero and on the right we
have some candidates something someplace
in terms of how it's changed and it's
gonna be centered at some value Y some
pixel Y so on the Left we have our
initial distribution okay so this was
our histogram that we computed in our
area and it's typically called Q and Q's
got a set of bins u 1 through m and
because it's gonna represent a density
we enforce the fact that the some of
them equals 1 so how do we do that well
we just sum them all up and we divide
all the bins by that value okay and you
see we have the audaciousness to call it
probability okay because well we're
gonna take these samples and we're
assume that it's representative of a
probability distribution function so
that's our distribution at the initial
of the target at some new location okay
we can compute the distribution again so
now P of U is a function of Y where Y is
the point that we're considering
remember you have to consider P of Z
given the state so y is gonna be that
that new point and it's called Y instead
of X that's how it's done in the mean
shift literature if you read this this
is this is what you would say and again
we're gonna build a distribution by
assuming that these things sum up to 1
so we have these two distributions and
what we have to do is we need a
similarity function that compares them
that compares the original Q and the new
P of Y which is the density at this
proposed place so the question is how
are we going to compare these
distributions now there are a variety of
functions that you can use to compare
histograms where the histograms are
normalized to one so they represent
probabilities
there's the min value there's there's
chi-squared variety the the one that was
used with respect to mean shift tracking
is referred to as the bhattacharya
coefficient bhattacharya coefficient
comes from something related to the
bhattacharya distance it's simply a way
of comparing distributions what you do
is you take your distributions
and you change it by taking the square
root of each of the components so if Q
is a distribution Q 1 through QM then Q
prime is going to be square root of Q 1
through the square root of Q M same
thing with the new proposed distribution
P around Y we're gonna take P prime
where we take the square roots when we
define it that way
the bhattacharya piz defined as follows
okay just take the sum over the product
of those square roots okay and you might
ask well why would you do that why would
you do that well you quickly realize
that if you take the magnitude of those
Square rooted vectors right the
magnitude is the square root of the sum
of the squares well the sum of the
squares is what
well since the sum of the Q's is 1 the
sum of the square roots then squared is
going to be 1 so the magnitude is 1 so
these magnitudes here those are 1 so
that means you just have this so
basically you're computing the dot
product the cosine of the angle between
the square roots of those distributions
and that sum of the square root the
thing in the Box here that's what's
referred to as the bhattacharya
coefficient it's just a way of comparing
distributions and so that's what they
did</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
