viruses the first is the parasitic virus
they typically scan programs on a system
example on the hard drive and then in
fact these programs the second is the
memory resident virus they're typically
part of an operating system and when the
system runs the operating system is
loaded into the memory so as long as the
system's running the virus resides in
the memory then it can infect any
running program on a system the third is
the macro virus they are typically
embedded in a document and when a
document is opened the virus also runs
and spreads the fourth is the boot
sector virus they reside in the boot
sector of a hard drive and whenever a
system is booted the boot sector virus
will run and spread a very important
type of virus is called a polymorphic
virus for polymorphic virus each
instance or each infection can look
different because part of the virus
program is encrypted by randomly
generated key at each infection the
purpose of using polymorphic virus is to
avoid detection by easy signature
matching we will discuss this little bit
later we should note that any of these
types of viruses can be polymorphic</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
