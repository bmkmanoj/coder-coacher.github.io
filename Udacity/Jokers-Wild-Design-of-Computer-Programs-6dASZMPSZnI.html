joker in every deck in this exercise
we're gonna allow four Joker's in fact
we're gonna have two kinds of Joker's
there's gonna be a black Joker and a red
Joker and the idea is that if you have a
joker as one of the cards in your hand
you can replace it with any other car to
the same color so if you get the black
Joker you can replace it with any Spade
or Club of any rank and the red Joker
you can replace it with any heart or
diamond of any front rank and what
you're asked to do is write a function
best wild hand of hand that comes up
tries all possibilities for jokers and
comes up with the best five-card
selection now like before hand might be
more than five cards it could be seven
cards and you still have to come up with
the best five-card answer that
substitutes in one of the appropriate
cards for any Joker's that exists in the
hand and here's some tests so this test
says here's a hand where we're doing
pretty good we already have a straight
six seven eight nine ten but we also
have a wild card and we can use that
wild card that Joker and replace it with
a jack rather than a ten and now we get
a slightly higher straight we have a
straight with a jack high rather than a
ten high and here's an example where we
have two tens
but we have two wild cards so we can add
in tens for both of them and we end up
with four wild cards or rather with four
tens
four of a kind and here's an example
where we show that even if there aren't
any Joker's we stick them up with the
right answer and I should say that the
hint still holds that itertools is still
your friend</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
