locally we still need to place the
public key on our remote server so SSH
can use it to log in there are multiple
ways to do this and there are even some
applications that will do most of the
work for you but we're gonna do it the
manual way first we want to make sure
we're logged into our server as the
student I'll first create a directory
called dot SSH using the make dere
command within my home directory this is
a special directory where all of your
key related files must be stored I'll
then create a new file within this
directory called authorized keys this is
another special file that will store all
of the public keys that this account is
allowed to use for authentication with
one key per line in that file now back
on my local machine I've read out the
contents of Linux course dot pub and I
just want to copy that then back on my
server as the student user I want to
edit this authorized key file and in
here I'll just paste in that contents
and save it
the final thing we need to do is set up
some specific file permissions on the
authorized key file and the SSH
directory this is a security measure
that SSH enforces to insure other users
cannot gain access to your account will
discuss file permissions and a lot more
detail shortly for now we'll set the
permissions using the following commands
will run chmod 764 for on the authorized
keys file
finally we're all done and we can now
log in as the student user but instead
of using username and password this I
flag and the definition here of what key
pair we want to use will allow me to
login using that key pair if you set a
passphrase for your key pair you'll be
asked to enter that but once you're done
you'll see you've logged in to the
server and you did not have to enter
your remote password for this user</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
