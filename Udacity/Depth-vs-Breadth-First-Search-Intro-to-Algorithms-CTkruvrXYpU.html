shortest paths in a graph it's going to
help to compare a little bit between the
kinds of depth-first search algorithms
that we were looking at with the kinds
of breadth-first search algorithms that
we're going to need to look at so let's
consider what the check connection
algorithm that we were just talking
about does if it's given this graph G
and we ask it to check the connection
between I and n the flow of control is
when we do check connection on I and n
checking to see whether I and n are
connected in the graph the way that it
proceeds is it starts off at I then
visits the neighbors of I in some order
let's say visits J first and then it ask
okay is J has been as J been visited so
far hi has J been visited so far no okay
well let's go to J and do a mark
component from J it's going to consider
the neighbors of J in some water well
let's say it considers K first has K
band visited no all right let's go mark
component K and so on so at some point
it may actually check one of the
neighbors that it's already visited but
at this point once it's kind of heading
in this direction it's going to continue
to explore the graph this way and it
will eventually hit n essentially the
path that it followed to get to n is one
two three four five links long which is
not very representative of the shortest
path which in this case is just the one
link so partly what's going on when you
run this kind of algorithm is it's
diving deep into the graph it starts off
a tie and it just keeps digging itself
deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper
and deeper and really what we'd like to
do is kind of check in circles around
I started I and check the things that
are close to I before the things that
are far from I and that's the essence of
what breadth-first search is going to do</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
