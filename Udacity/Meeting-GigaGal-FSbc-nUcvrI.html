problems behind strapping on your arm
cannon and going on an adventure to jump
around on top of stuff and blast away
evil robots I know right me too welcome
to our second course on 2d game
development with libgdx in the first
course we made a simple game of dodging
icicles in this course we'll learn how
to make a much more complex platformer
game featuring our hero giga gal in the
first three levels you'll let get google
walk around including this cool walk
animation and you'll let her jump around
on top of platforms giga gal will jump
around on the top of platforms dodging
and fighting enemies with bullets fired
out of her arm cannon sounds pretty cool
huh so what do we need to do to bring
Giggy gal to life this course has eight
levels to be in this level you'll learn
how to draw the images and animations
that make up Giga gals world in the next
levels will add the logic for a giggle
herself the platforms and the camera
that follows Giga gal around the game
world and the second half of the course
will add the evil robot enemies and let
Giga gal fight back with our cannon
finally we'll learn to load level data
and add a HUD and on-screen controls by
the way this course relies heavily on
the content from our first course on 2d
game development with libgdx so if you
haven't already you'll definitely want
to take that course before moving on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
