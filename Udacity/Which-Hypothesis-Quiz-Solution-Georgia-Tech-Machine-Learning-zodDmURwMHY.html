right so of those others well si is
pretty good because it does separate the
pluses from the minuses we even liked it
so much that we used it in round two but
it doesn't seem as good to me as a
because a actually does a good job of
separating the very the more heavily
weighted points so I would I would say a
so in fact that is what our little
learning system shows it shows a and now
through the trick of animation I leave
you with a and that is exactly the right
answer by the way Michael if you look at
these three hypotheses and their weights
you end up with something kind of
interesting so if you look at this third
hypothesis that's chosen here it turns
out to have a very low error you'll
notice that the errors are going down
over time by the way 0.14 and it has a
much higher alpha of 0.92 now if you
look at these weights and you add them
up you end up with a cute little
combination so let me draw that for you
okay Michael so I cleaned up a little
bit so that you could see it if you take
each of the three hypotheses that we
produced and you weight them accordingly
you end up with the bottom figure no way
absolutely that's kind of awesome so
what you're saying is that even though
we were only using half planes or access
aligned semi planes for all the week
learners that at the end of the day it
actually kind of bent the line around
and captured the positive and negative
examples perfectly right does that
remind you of anything else we've talked
about in the past everything nothing no
I don't know I mean so with with
decision trees you can make shapes like
that and and the fact that we're doing a
weighted combination of things reminds
me of the neural nets yeah you remind
you of one other thing I'm imagining
that you want me to say nearest
neighbors but I can't quite make the
connection well you recall on our
discussion with nearest neighbors when
we did weighted nearest neighbor in
particular we did weighted linear
regression we were able to take a simple
hypothesis add it together in order to
get a more complicated hypothesis that's
true because it's local right exactly
because it's local and this is a general
feature of ensemble methods that if you
try to look at just some particular
hypothesis class
let's just call it H because you're
doing weighted averages over hypotheses
drawn from that hypothesis class this
hypothesis class is almost all row is at
least as complicated as this hypothesis
class and often is more complicated so
you're able to be more expressive even
though you're using simple hypotheses
because you're combining them in some
way I'm not surprised that you can
combine simple things to get complicated
things but I am surprised that you can
combine them just with sums and get
complicated things because sums often
act very you know sort of friendly right
it's it's a linear combination not a
nonlinear combination actually Michael
part of the reason you get something
nonlinear here is because you're passing
it through a non-linearity at the end
design yeah that's a good thing we
should we should ponder that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
