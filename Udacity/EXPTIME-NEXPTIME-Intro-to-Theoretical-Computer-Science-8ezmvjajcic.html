the reason is as follows so when we
simulate non-determinism on a
deterministic Ram what we have is here a
polynomial and here we have 2 to the
power of that polynomial which
essentially was needed for trying all
possibilities for using the if-better
function or non determinism if you will
now if we tried the same thing over here
what we would have we would have a
non-deterministic machine that runs in 2
to the power of some polynomial of
endtime now if we wanted to simulate
this on a deterministic RAM what you
could have in the worst case there is a
running time of 2 to the power of 2 to
the power of a polynomial of n which
does not fall into this category here
anymore because we said that exponential
time was 2 to the power of some
polynomial of n and not 2 to the power
of some exponential function of n so you
must not make the mistake that simply
because we can simulate NP in
exponential time that we can also
simulate non-deterministic exponential
time in exponential time but given how
bad these running times here are you
will of course not come across them very
often in practice</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
