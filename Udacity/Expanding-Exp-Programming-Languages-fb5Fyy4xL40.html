our first grammar rule expression goes
to expression plus expression our second
grammar rule very similar but for the -
alright so here I actually have quite a
bit of Python code and we're gonna walk
through it together and then you're
going to help me finish it out so here's
our definition of our grammar it has
four rewrite rules and we're I'm going
to need your help is given a list of
tokens and a grammar I want to find all
possible ways to expand it using those
rules let me just show you what I mean
by that here's our grammar again and
let's say that we started with a
expression I would want us to come out
with a expression plus expression a
expression minus expression a expression
and a num for each of these possible
token positions and for each grammar
rule we removed the starting token and
replaced it with the right hand side of
the grammar rule this is the way we're
going to enumerate all of the valid
strings in the grammar now you'll notice
that I've made more expressions in many
of these cases so I could go from here
and start and expand it again and get a
few more strings until eventually I'm
full entirely of terminals I'm gonna
call the number of times I do this the
depth so if we start with a expression
and we expand it to depth one we get
four new utterances four new sentences
you're gonna have to help me write that
expansion procedure down here I've got
some code to help us print it out for
now we're only going to enumerate things
up to a depth of one and we're going to
start with just expression and then
we're going to use your expand procedure
to make many more utterances many more
sentences starting from expression
probably four more so then we'll have a
total of five and then at the end of the
day we print them all out so if you do
it correctly this is the output you
expect to see our original sentence but
then it's been expanded with four more
expression plus expression expression
minus expression open expression close
and numb and in fact if we go back up
here and change this to a expression the
example we worked through in the
comments we get the expected output a is
unchanged because there's no rewrite
rule in our
for dealing with it but a expression
becomes a expression plus expression a
expression minus expression a open
expression close and a numb your job
submit via the interpreter the correct
definition for the expand procedure so
that it does this here's a hint you're
going to need yield with high
probability and you may also want to end
up using list comprehensions by the way
this is a very tricky quiz this is not
easy to get right the first time so you
should not feel bad if something goes
wrong give this your all but it is very
difficult compared to what we've been up
to so far</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
