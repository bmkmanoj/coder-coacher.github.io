issue of extensibility and some of the
approaches that have been taken to
achieve this goal historically I should
mention that there was interest in
extensibility at least as far back as
1981 with the system that was developed
at CMU called the Hydra operating system
the Hydra operating system provided
kernel mechanisms for resource
allocation the key word is mechanisms
not policies just mechanisms for
resource allocation in the kernel and it
had a way of providing access to
resources using a capability based
approach the notion of capability has a
special connotation in the operating
system literature and that is it is an
entity that can be passed from one to
the other cannot be forged and can be
verified all of the things that you want
in order to make sure that the system
integrity is not compromised is
enshrined in this abstract notion of
capability and as originally envisioned
capability was a heavyweight mechanism
in terms of implementing it efficiently
in an operating system and because
capability is a heavyweight mechanism in
the Hydra operating system resource
managers were built as coarse-grained
objects in order to reduce a border
crossing over head because border
crossing in the Hydra system would mean
that you have to pass capability from
one object or another and validate the
capability for entering a particular
object and so on and for that reason
Hydra used coarse-grained objects to
implement resource managers that way
they can reduce the border crossing
overhead and implementing resource
managers as coarse-grained objects also
means that it limits the opportunities
for customization and extensibility in
other words the course
sure you make these objects the less
opportunity you have for customizing the
services which is exactly the strike
against monolithic kernel as well so
while in principle Hydra had all the
right ideas of providing minimal
mechanisms in the kernel and having the
resource managers implement policies
because the fundamental mechanism for
accessing the resources was through this
capability which is a heavyweight
abstract notion to implement efficiently
in practice Hydra did not fully achieve
its goal of extensibility one of the
most well known extensible operating
system of the early 90s was the mark
operating system from CMU it was
microkernel based providing very limited
mechanisms in the microkernel and
implementing all the services that you
expect from an operating system as
server processes that run as normal user
level processes above the kernel and
clearly was this microkernel based
approach mark achieved its goal of
extensibility so focused on
extensibility and portability the key
word is portability and therein lies the
rub performance took a backseat because
mark was very much focused on making the
operating system portable across
different architectures in addition to
paying attention to extensibility and
this unfortunately gave a bad press for
microkernel based design because it
focused on these twin goals of
portability and extensibility allowing
performance to take a backseat and since
operating systems are generally so
focused on performance this design
choice in mark of supporting portability
gave microkernel based design a bad
press but later on when we look at l3
approach to microkernel based design we
will revisit the right way
build a microkernel based design but in
this lesson let's focus on spins
approach to extensibility so the key
idea in spin is to co-locate a minimal
kernel with its extension in the same
hardware address space and avoid the
border crossing between the components
of the kernel and the extensions of the
kernel that are containing the specific
services that the applications need and
this collocation also means that we
avoid the border crossing which he said
is one of the biggest potentials for
losing out on performance but if we're
going to co-locate the kernel and
extensions in the same hardware address
space isn't that compromising on
protection wasn't that the strike
against the dass like structure that we
talked about earlier well the approach
that spin took was to rely on the
characteristics of a strongly typed
programming language so that the
compiler can enforce the modularity that
we need in order to give guarantees
about the protection so by using a
strongly typed language in the case of
spin they used modular three more on
that in a minute the kernel is able to
provide well-defined interfaces all of
you may be quite familiar with declaring
function prototypes in a header file and
having the actual implementation of the
procedures in other files in a large
software project this is the same idea
that is now taken to the design of the
operating system itself after all
operating system is also a piece of
software a complex piece of software and
why not use a strongly typed language as
the basis for building the operating
system that's the idea in the spin
approach now what you get when use a
strongly typed language is
you cannot cheat for instance in a
language like C you can typecast
pointers so that a given data structure
can be viewed completely differently
depending on what you need to get done
at the moment that's not possible
with a strongly typed language data
abstractions provided by the programming
language such as an object serve as
containers for logical protection
domains that is we are no longer reliant
on hardware address spaces to provide
the protection between different
services and the kernel as I mentioned
the kernel provides only the interfaces
and these logical protection domains
actually implement the functionality
that is enshrined in those interface
functions and there can be several
implementations of the interface
functions and that's where the
flexibility comes in applications can
dynamically bind to different
implementations of the same interface
functions and that's how we get
different instantiations of specific
system components getting you the
flexibility that you want in
constructing an operating system because
we have co-located the kernel and the
extension in the same hardware address
space we are making the extensions as
cheap as a procedure call so in a
nutshell what we've accomplished was the
spin approach to extensibility is we are
writing on the characteristics of a
strongly typed programming language that
enforces strong typing and therefore
allows the operating system designer to
implement logical protection domains
instead of relying on Hardware address
spaces and consequently we're making
extensions as cheap as procedure calls</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
