twice a year with grants situation this
of course is just an example and these
numbers could be different depending on
how his account was set up however
numbers of play the roles that I've
written in here this number is his
principal the amount he first invested
here goes the interest rate divided by 2
and the exponent is the number of years
that have passed x 2 now we always like
generalizations so let's see if we can
apply one here I think we're going to
need some variable names however let's
call our principal p our will be our
annual interest rate written as a
decimal t will be the number of years
that have passed since the account
opened and will be the number of times
interest is compounded per year this was
two in our example up here and a will be
the total amount of money in the account
I'd like you to use these quantities we
just came up with to create a general
equation for a the total amount of money
in the account just fill in the proper
letters in these different slots
remember you can use this formula as a
guideline for figuring out what goes
where here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
