out are the ones coming out of the
report output maximize that result and
I'll bring it into our window there are
many different things going in this type
of output as compared to the linear or
logistic regression or even stepwise
tool outputs the first thing I look at
is what is the root node error and what
this means is when we cross validated
our data against our model how many
occur to error and it looks like 15%
errored out so they determined that they
went to the incorrect terminal node so
what this root node error shows us is of
the estimation data that we pumped in
there they sliced out a little sliver of
and actually made their own little
validation data set within that
estimation sample and within that
validation sample how many were
predicted correctly are actually in this
case errored out meaning that they went
to the incorrect terminal node and it
looks like 15% of the records that did
the next thing I look at is this pruning
table what this shows me is how many
levels are are to the decision tree and
some error terms with cross validation
samples yet I'm not going to go too far
in depth on this result what I think
would be more interesting of looking at
the leaf summary and these different
plots down here is actually flip over to
the interactive browse since it does
such a good job at visualizing to help
you interpret the results from this
decision tree model</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
