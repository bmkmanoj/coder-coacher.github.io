helpful as a sub component to this
process is to be able to say well if we
got a set of points in some space and
we're trying to find the maximum
likelihood Gaussian with some known
variants mode is the maximum likelihood
Gaussian what is the best way of setting
the mean to capture this set of points
so fortunately this is really easy to do
and the reason that it works out this
way is the same reason that we've talked
about in several of the other lessons
but the maximum likelihood mean of the
Gaussian this mu that we want to set is
the mean of the data the mean is the
mean that's pretty mean and it's no mean
feat that it works out this way and what
oh no this is well done so in particular
this is really easy to compute if we
know that all this data is coming from
the same Gaussian then finding the mean
that maximizes the likelihood is just
computing the mean of all those points
right we kind of just did that just a
few slides ago exactly okay all right so
given a bunch of data points that I all
know came from some Gaussian I can
compute the mean of that Gaussian by
actually taking the sample mean and I
can mean it okay so the tricky thing of
course is what happens if there's k of
them how do we set the K different means
and our answer is going to be there I
just wrote it do you see it nope that's
because it's hidden variables ah my
favorite kind of variable variables you
don't have to see so what we're going to
imagine is the data points instead of
just being X that's actually X and then
a bunch of random variables that are
indicator variables on which cluster
that X came from so it's not just X
anymore it's X and let's say a bunch of
zeros and then a one corresponding to
which cluster generated X now of course
if we knew that that would be really
useful information we're going to have
to do some inference to figure out what
those values are but the concept is that
by adding these extra hidden variables
in it really kind of breaks up the
problem in a convenient way okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
