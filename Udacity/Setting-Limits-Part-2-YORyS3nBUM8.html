our edit text preference appropriately
what we'd like to do is disable the okay
or positive button until the users typed
enough text the first part of this is
easy will override the show dialogue
method which is called to show the
dialogue after the superclass is called
the dialogue should be present so we can
safely fetch the edit text view by
calling get edit text will use a special
callback of edit text called an edit
text listener we'll add an edit text
listener which will get called when the
user changes the text
we'll only utilize the after text change
callback now there is a tricky part we'd
like to get the alert dialog that is
used by our edit text preference but
there's no supported way to get at it we
know it has to be there because the
dialogue preference provides an alert
dialog builder to customize the dialogue
let's take a quick look at the Android
source that implements dialogue
preference
first of all let's grab a Chrome
extension this extension not only makes
it easy to search the Android SDK but it
also adds an Android view source link to
developer.android.com so now we can just
type ad to search for edit text
preference and when we see dialog
preference we also get a link to its
source as you can see there's an
internal member called M dialogue this
is what is returned and get dialogue but
where is it created as we can see it's
created for our builder as we expected
so at least in current versions of
Android we can expect this to be an
alert dialogue great but just in case
this changes in the future will protect
the code we'll use the instance of
operator to verify that the dialogue
returned using get dialogue is an alert
dialogue as expected if so we can call
dialogue get button alert dialog button
positive to get the button we need to
enable and disable</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
