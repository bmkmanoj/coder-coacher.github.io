operators the first four bitwise
operators that will look at not and or
and xor are closely related to the
logical operators we've seen before that
operate on bull values the difference
being that bitwise operators manipulate
bits ones and zeros and the logical
operators manipulate bull values true
and false the first bitwise operator is
the knot or invert operator this
operator takes each binary digit also
called a bit and it flips its value so
if we look at this value we have four
zeros followed by four ones and when we
use the binary not operator it flips
these bits and the new value will be
equal to this where all the zeros have
become ones and all the ones have become
zeros now you'll notice that the values
on the right still show the base 10
representation of the number while their
base two equivalent is shown here in the
comment and it's just important to
remember that almost any value actually
I'd say every value on a computer at
some point can reduce down to zeros and
ones now for us it makes a whole lot
more sense to look at numbers in base 10
and it does in binary but at one time
that was the way that we programmed the
next bitwise operator is and when we use
bitwise and it goes bit by bit through
two numbers and it produces a 1 if both
bits or 1 or 0 otherwise if you want to
relate the bitwise and operator to the
logical and operator will want to
imagine that each bit is a truth value
where 0 is false and one is true and if
we think of them that way then we can
construct a true statement for example
if it's raining outside and it's cold
outside then I should wear a heavy
jacket let's make our first value here
which is a 0 that represents false
pertain to the is raining truth value so
it's false that it's raining outside and
then let's make our second value here
which is a 1 which represents true be
part of the truth statement as well so
it's true that it is cold outside now
because bo
statements aren't true then it's not
true that we need to wear a heavy jacket
outside it's not raining it is cold but
because it's not raining and it's cold
at the same time then we don't need to
wear a heavy jacket and the zero that we
see here in the result is equivalent to
false and we would do this process for
each bit in both of the operands until
we get our full result the same process
happens for each bit I've added some
space before this first number here so
that we can see each bit on top of one
another so I'm going to fill these in
one by one as we perform an and
operation on each pair of bits so for
the first we have 0 and 1 that would be
0 for the second one we have one and one
that would be one and then I'll continue
filling this out until we get our final
number and I'll print out the number
just as a sanity check and we get the
same number here as we do when we're
actually using the + operator now the
bitwise or operator works in a similar
way for each pair of bits at the first
bit or the second bit is 1 then their
results in it one otherwise it results
in a 0 so we can work our way through
this one bit at a time and we get this
binary number and if we print it out we
get 239 again next let's look at xor xor
is closely related to the logical not
equal to operator so for each pair of
bits if the bits are not equal to each
other or they don't match then it
results in a 1 otherwise it results in a
0 so for this first pair of bits we have
one and one one and one and those are
equal to each other so we would result
in a false we want them to be not equal
to each other and I'll continue doing
this for the rest of the bits and we get
a result of 90 if we go through each bit
and this matches our other result I'm
going to go ahead and skip to the
example but if you want to learn more
about these bitwise operators like the
left shift operator or the right shift
operator then check out the links
