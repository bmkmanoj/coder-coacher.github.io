virtualization requirement that which is
mentioned in the previous quiz it is
fortunate to observe that commodity
Hardware actually has more than two
protection levels looking at the
architecture that's at least in the
server space most dominant the x86
architecture there are four protection
levels called rings ring zero has the
highest privilege and can access all of
the resources and execute all hardware
supported instructions and this is where
in a native model the operating system
would reside so when the OS is in
control of all the hardware resources it
sits in ring zero
in contrast ring three has the least
level of privilege so this is where the
applications would resign and whenever
the applications try to perform
something some operation for which they
don't have the appropriate privileges
then a trap would because and control
would be switched to the ring zero to
the lowest privilege level one way in
which these protection levels can be
used is to put the hypervisor now in
rings Ihram so that's the one that has
full control over the hardware to leave
the applications to execute at ring 3
level and then the operating system
would execute a drink one level will
explain how this actually works in the
following video more recent x86
architectures also introduce two
different protection modes called root
and non root within each of these modes
the for protection levels exist so there
are like two times these protection
rings now when running in root mode all
of the operations are permitted all
hardware is accessible all instructions
can be executed so this is the highest
privileged level and this is the ring
zero of the root mode is where we would
run the hypervisor in contrast in non
root mode certain types of operations
are not permitted so then the guest VMs
would execute in this non root mode and
they would have as they did in native
execution their applications running in
ring 3 and the operating system
running at rings Europe privilege level
attempt by the guest operating system to
perform privileged operations cause
traps that are called
VM exits and these trigger a switch to
this route mode and pass control to the
hypervisor when the hypervisor completes
its operation it passes control back to
the virtual machine by performing a VM
entry which switches the mode into
non-root mode to ring zero so that the
execution continues</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
