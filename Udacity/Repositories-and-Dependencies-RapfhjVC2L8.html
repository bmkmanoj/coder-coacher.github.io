going to depend on perhaps quite large
collection of libraries maybe you start
depending on just one or two libraries
so you just put their jars in your
project directory and keep on truckin
you end up having a huge collection of
jar archives but then what if a new
version of your dependency is released
you'll have to manually download and
update two jars and in turn all of its
dependencies and all of its dependencies
dependencies and so on this is clearly
getting unmanageable another option
would be to include a list of your
project dependencies and have anyone who
wants to build your project go and
download them all of course they would
then have to hunt all over the internet
to find them and they would have to
check all the time to make sure that the
versions they have matched a list of
your dependencies brutal right of course
since this is a course about Gradle
Gradle provides a better way most
libraries are more generally artifacts
that you might want to use in your
project are present in various
repositories around the internet the
most prominent repositories are probably
maven central NJ center anyone can
upload artifacts these repositories as
long as they include the appropriate
metadata every artifact in the
repository can be identified and
retrieved by unique set of coordinates
if an artifact has dependencies of its
own that is also specified the upshot is
Gradle knows how to retrieve artifacts
from all sorts of repositories and will
store them in a local cache to make them
available for your project not only that
but if you have multiple projects using
the same artifact it'll only ever be
downloaded once Gradle will also take
care of retrieving a transitive
dependencies and will even resolve
conflicts when different parts of your
dependency tree rely on different
versions of the same artifact</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
