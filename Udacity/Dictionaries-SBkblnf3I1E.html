Python we've seen the string type and
we've seen the list type now we're going
to introduce the dictionary type so
there are many things that are common
between these three there are other
things that are different so to create a
string we could have a sequence of
characters inside quotes to create a
list we use the square bracket and we
could have a sequence of elements inside
the square bracket and the elements
could be any type unlike a string where
they had to be characters so our string
was a sequence of characters our list
was a list of any kind of value so a
list of elements of any value the
dictionary type we're going to create
using the curly bracket and the entries
inside a dictionary our key value pairs
so here I've created a dictionary with
two elements and each element the key is
a string here's the string hydrogen and
the value associated with that element
is the number the keys in a dictionary
can be any immutable value so they don't
need to be strings they could be numbers
they could be other things the values
can be any value so what a dictionary is
is a set of key value pairs and the
property that a dictionary will give us
is like the hash table that we can look
up a key and get the value associated
with that key so one important property
of all types is whether they're
immutable or mutable we saw that the
string was immutable that means once we
create a string we can't modify that
string it has the same value it always
has a list was mutable we could change
the values of elements in the list after
we create the list we could upend to the
list adding new elements to it a
dictionary is also mutable so after we
create a dictionary we could add new key
value pairs to it we could change the
value of values associated with keys we
saw with strings if s is a string then
we can do s index I that will give us
the i'th letter in string with lists we
can do something very similar if P is a
list we can do p index I to get the ice
element of the list with dictionaries
it's a little bit different the syntax
is the same we can do D index
k with both strings and lists these were
numbers here the K is whatever the key
value is so this is a key in the
dictionary what D index K will give us
the value associated with that key in
the dictionary we'll see some examples
soon we can also use our indexing and
assignments we saw with a list we could
do this that would replace the value of
the I element of P with whatever we have
here with a string we can't do that that
produces an error and the reason we
can't do it is because strings are
immutable so there's no way to modify
characters in a string with the
dictionary we can and what the meaning
of this is very similar to the meaning
of update in our hash table so that's
equivalent to update the value the value
associated with k to be v</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
