header was this URL I an adorable main /
example okay I'll walk through how I
found the answers and hopefully you did
something similar so we go to our
terminal and we said example calm so
let's make that request tell matt to dub
dub dub dot example.com 480 okay now we
say get / HTTP / 1.0 host dub dub dub
dot example.com aha nice simple response
we can see our status code is 302 and we
can see our location header is right
here Anna dot org if that didn't work
you know here's how you do it alright so
let's uh let's play around a little bit
more so we see that this is a redirect
sponsor response because it was status
code 302 and it's saying the actual
content is here let's give a shot at
making the request to find this we're
going to tell that to I Anna org and
make a request for this path and see how
it goes see if we can get it 200 we make
the request to iono org telnet to dub
dub dub iono cord port 80 then we say
get / the main / example HD / 1.0 okay
so here we are you can see where I
telnet it into iono org and you can see
the request I made for flash domain /
example I used HTTP 1.0 again and you
can see the response this is actually
kind of funny so responded with HTTP 1.1
status 200 this is actually good example
of you know the web not lining up
exactly correctly but that's how it goes
generally this one point one should have
matched this one point zero but since
these guys control the web I guess they
can do whatever they like okay so you
can see the common headers date you know
today actually today for me in the past
for you you can see the server header
Apache you see it this is interesting
header last modified
page was last modified over a year ago
this is for caching purposes this tells
our browser that we don't need to bother
requesting this page again no we don't
need new updates if it hasn't changed
since the state content type this is
typical text HTML and below that you see
the content pretty cool huh</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
