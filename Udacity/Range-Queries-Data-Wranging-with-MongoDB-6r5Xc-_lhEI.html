operators to support range queries let
me show you what I mean
MongoDB provides several inequality
operators that enable us to perform this
type of query the inequality operators
we may use include greater than less
than greater than or equal to less than
or equal to or not equal to there are
also a couple that are designed for
querying array fields we'll talk about
those in a later lesson now let's look
at some queries against our city's
collection that provide examples of
using inequality operators okay so
imagine that we want to query for all
cities with a population greater than a
quarter million instead of specifying an
exact number here as the value for our
query document which is going to be
passed to find here we're instead going
to use the greater than operator and the
value of population in our query
document is going to be a sub document
using that operator we can specify a
more constrained range for a query like
this using an additional operator now
this example is very similar to what we
just looked at the only difference being
that in the value for population in our
query document we're specifying an
additional operator of less than or
equal to 500,000 thus defining a more
constrained range for this query here
now this type of range based query works
across many different data types we can
do something similar for Strings so here
the semantics of this range are give us
all city names that begin with X let's
go ahead and run this code and here we
can see that in the results we get back
looks like we're getting back cities
that just begin with the letter X total
match of 22 cities out of the 20,000 or
so that are in this collection okay
let's look at our code again we can also
do this type of query against dates here
we're specifying a Python date as the
lower and upper bound and so here we're
looking for all cities that have a
founding date sometime in the year 1837
and actually to be precise here we
should really have this be greater than
or equal to okay now let's run this okay
and we get three cities that match we
can see that the founding date here
seems to be within range as it is here
and also here for the city
Chicago finally we can also do things
like use the not equals operator to for
example in this case find all cities
with the country that's not equal to the
United States</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
