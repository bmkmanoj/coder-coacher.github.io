cognate looks like there are many things
that we can do to improve it we're going
to talk about three of them pulling one
by when convolutions and something a bit
more advanced called the inception
architecture the first improvement is a
better way to reduce the spatial extent
of your future maps in the convolutional
pyramid until now we've used striding to
shift the filters by a few pixel each
time and reduce the future map size this
is a very aggressive way to Dan sample
an image it removes a lot of information
what if instead of skipping one in every
two convolutions we still run with a
very small stride say for example one
but then took all the convolutions in a
neighborhood and combined them somehow
that operation is called pooling and
there are a few ways to go about it the
most common is max pooling at every
point on the feature map look at a small
neighborhood around that point and
compute the maximum of all the responses
around it there are some advantages to
using max pooling first it doesn't add
to your number of parameters so you
don't risk an increase in overfitting
second it simply often yields more
accurate models however since the
convolutions that run below run at a
lower stride the model then becomes a
lot more expensive to compute and now
you have even more hyper parameters to
worry about the pooling region size and
the pooling stride and know they don't
have to be the same a very typical
architecture for a covenant is a few
layers alternating convolutions and max
pooling followed by a few fully
connected layers at the top the first
famous model to use this architecture
was Lynette five designed by Jung
laocoon - the character recognition back
in 1998 modern conventional networks
such as Alex Nets which famously won the
competitive image net object recognition
challenge in 2012 used a very similar
architecture with a few wrinkles another
notable form of pooling is average
pooling instead of taking the max just
take an average over the window of
pixels around their specific location
it's a little bit like providing a
blurred low resolution view of the
feature map below
we're going to take advantage of that
