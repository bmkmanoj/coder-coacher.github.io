you want to use first I should explain
what exactly a view and Android is
simply put a view is a rectangle on the
screen that shows some content it can be
an image a piece of text or a button or
anything else that the app can display
now these individual views make up what
we call the layout of the screen
everything about what you see and
interact with in your app is called the
user interface or UI for short there are
different types of views with different
names a view that shows some text is
called a text view here are some
examples a view that shows an image is
called an image view and these are some
examples a view that shows a button is
called well a button these are some
examples now there are many other types
of views in Android which are really
helpful to use but we're going to focus
on these three first earlier I mentioned
that every view is a rectangle on the
screen but where are all the rectangles
well technically they're invisible but I
will draw them for you so you can see
where the bounds of each rectangle is as
you can see every app can be broken down
into the individual views that make it
up in other words a view is the basic
building block that you use to build up
the layout for your app to help you
understand the idea of views being
rectangles on the screen here's a
situation you may be more familiar with
if you ever use it application like
paint or Google drawings then you may
have added a text box to the canvas then
you type in your text if you click
outside of it though you don't see the
bounds of the rectangle but they are
there and the bounds actually do start
to matter when you start to do things
like adding a background color or adding
a border around it then it does matter
how big the rectangle is I also want to
point out that the format of these view
names is in camel case camel case means
that there are no spaces in between
words and the beginning of each word is
capitalized the reason why it's called
camel case is because the outline of the
word goes up and down like the humps of
a camel's back you're going to be seeing
camel case more throughout this course
ok let's practice what you learned this
is a screenshot of the new
email app from Google called inbox can
you identify the different types of
views here to help you I've highlighted
the individual views for example for a
can you tell me if it's a text view an
image view or button do the same for B
as well as the rest of the views</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
