influence traits like eye color hair
color or susceptibility to cancer even
they can also influence our ability to
metabolize drugs like alcohol a drug is
defined as any chemical that when
introduced into the body can influence
biological processes this includes
things like alcohol even caffeine now we
have a very special experiment setup for
all you you deixa students out there
today this is Lauren you know Lauren and
this is Ginny hi I'm Jenny and they're
going to represent how two people with
two different genomes can metabolize a
drug differently a drug like alcohol now
they're about the same height they're
about the same size and we might expect
them to have the same tolerance but
let's see what happens when they finish
their drinks cheers Cheers
all right Lauren and Jenny happened to
be above the age of 21 which is the
legal drinking limit in the United
States neither of them drove to work
today and because they're responsible
with alcohol they actually didn't finish
their drinks so let's see how do you
feel ladies I feel okay and what about
you Jenny I feel amazing you do oh you
look a little uh you look a little red
to me yeah it's all the warm in here
isn't it um not really um I can see in
your cheeks though you've got some you
got some redness there does that
normally happen when you drink yes
that's what we call alcohol flush
reaction sort of that that redness in
your cheeks that that I see there yeah
and I see a little bit of your chest as
well yeah yeah and so that normally
happens when you drink huh yes it does
does it run in your family well my dad
actually is allergic to alcohol and gets
hives oh my gosh well the alcohol flush
reaction is known to be prevalent in
those of an Asian background so I'd like
to know from you do you have the alcohol
flush reaction</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
