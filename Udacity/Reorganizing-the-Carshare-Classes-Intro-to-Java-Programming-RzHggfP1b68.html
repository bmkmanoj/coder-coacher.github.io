classes there was the car share app
which used the simulation which to use
cars and persons the simulation and car
classes go together and are specific to
the car share app the person is more
general and could possibly be used for
other situations these three classes
could be organized into packages the
person class might go into a more
general calm dude a CD package and the
simulation in car would go in a more
specific car share package the car share
app is just a main program that we're
writing that uses these other things so
we'll keep it in the default package
creating packages and blue jay is a
little bit funny so i'll show you how to
do this from the car share project i'm
going to look up at the menu it's at the
upper left for me but it might be right
along this bar for you i'll go to edit
new package and then put in the package
name calm da da city carshare now the
package appears here in blue jay i can
open it up this is the calm package this
is the Udacity package and this is the
car share package in the car sure
package I want to put the car and
simulation classes so to do that I'll go
to that edit menu again and then I
select add classroom file and then
inside the folder that contains all of
the car share stuff I'll select the car
and add it now the car shows up in the
car share package but I need to add the
simulation to edit add class from file
simulation add now in the Udacity
package I want to add the person edit
add class from file and this time I'll
select person and now it's here so this
compiles but if I go back to the car
share package and try to compile these
I'll find cannot find symbol class
person that's because person is no
longer right next to car and simulation
so I have to tell Java where to look for
the person class where do I look for the
person class in comedy now before I ask
you a question I've got one more cleanup
task right
now there are actually two persons
there's one in com Udacity and there's
one in car share seven so all of the
classes that i copied into different
packages i need to remove so i'll remove
car and it's okay that I'm permanently
removing it because I copied it and then
I'll remove person and i'll remove
simulation so like i just mentioned
right now car isn't compiling what
import statements would you need to add
to this project to make it compile again
go ahead and reorganize all of the
classes into the right packages then to
get the car share app running again to
which class should i add the import
commute a city person right none if I
never need to import this to which class
should i add the import com Udacity
carshare car and to which class should i
add the import calm dude a city carshare
simulation and remember right none if
you never use a particular import
statement and separate answers with
commas if you find that there are two
classes that use the same import</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
