google apps even before internal testing
among employees or dogfooding each app
goes to the Google user experience
review process the goal of this process
is to get the app in front of
experienced Googlers who focus on
various parts of the user experience
such as design interaction patterns
accessibility and more as we've looked
into production izing sunshine we wanted
to get some expert help with a UI that
would both leverage a broader set of
implementation skills and we're able to
present in the first course and begin to
illustrate material design concepts of
course we turn to Android UX legend
Roman Nurik who has helped many Android
developers improve the UX of their
applications with direct feedback
develop design tool to make constructing
Android UX easier and who has
contributed - clock news a to the
Android world Roman it's so great to
have you here with us now when you first
looked at sunshine from Android
fundamentals what are the things that
you felt worked really well in the
design so let me let me take out my
phone and just point them out so I think
that the first thing that was done
really well was just the use of
hierarchy or the overall you know
hierarchy of the screen you have your
your branding on top and then you have
the most important piece of information
the current conditions and weather at
the top as well in this kind of nice big
display type and then below that you
have the secondary information the
forecast for tomorrow in the next day
and so on that was one I think another
of those done really well is the use of
key lines so key liens are essentially
these invisible vertical rules that that
you can use to align streams of
information and I felt like the
specifically the use of that second key
line the the one where you have the the
branding the current temperature the the
dates of the kind of later forecasts
those are like kind of left aligned to
that second key line and feel like that
is really nice and helping visually
process the information very very
quickly so I felt like those are
probably two - my favorite aspects of
the of the existing design tell us a bit
about what you redesigned in the new
production version of sunshine and why
well I think I'll just talk about one I
think
there's one that's really important here
and it's it's an essential part of
material design and that's the use of
surfaces so the first is I felt that
well with surfaces I guess in the
existing app you you kind of I guess the
use of surfaces was all over the place
on on portrait phone screens on
landscape tablet screens it wasn't
really consistent it felt like
information was being presented in
different ways and what's worse on on
landscape tablets you actually had this
kind of massive sea of white space and
the information was kind of floating on
top of that and I felt like the use of
surfaces could really help both manage
that white space and introduce
consistency and so in the new design we
use this the single elevated white card
to present the current conditions of you
know of the I guess the current
temperature right and we use that
consistently across phones and tablets
and so that does three things the first
is that again it introduces consistency
across screens the second is that it
actually makes it easier to do motion to
you know another big part of material
design is motion it helps you it helps
you do things like transition from list
to detail when you can kind of you know
have a single object that appears in
both and transition them it's really
nice and easy and I guess the third is
it really kind of helps you manage space
on that landscape tablet screen the fact
that you can have this kind of nice big
card to present you know one major
stream of information and kind of have
everything else fall and from I guess
from outside of that it makes it really
kind of make some nice use of space I
guess I mean just very bluntly it's it's
a really nice use of that massive screen
real estate and so it does those three
things really well I think and that's
that's one of things that we really
focus on in this redesign for sunshine
Wow
tons of great feedback like we expected
we have a really good start but there
are some rough edges to work through
before we have a production ready user
experience so how does that constructive
feedback mapped or production quality
goals well the design feedback we got
around consistency white
face and motion fall under in chandni
those little details can really make
sunshine stand out when you combine that
with the suggestions team fix-it is made
such as under simplify my life having
sunshine display useful information even
when there's no network connectivity or
poor user input and under make me
amazing having sunshine open up new
extremely useful ways of getting weather
information front and center well you
have some pretty good ideas about how to
start getting us closer to the
production of sunshine</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
