radical works the same way as it does
for factors are just numbers we'll look
at simplifying the cubed root of x to
the fourth times y to the six keep in
mind that these variables actually
represent numbers like X could equal two
and Y could be three our rules for these
won't change will still apply the
product rule if we can and we can only
remove factors if they repeat three
times for example we can split this up
into the cube root of x times x times X
times X these four X's are the same as X
to the fourth similarly our second
radical will have the cube root of Y to
the six since our X variable repeats
three times we can pull one of them out
we can also pull out one Y from these
three and one Y from these three this X
however is a little bit lonely it
doesn't have three of itself so we leave
it inside the cube root so our final
answer is x times y squared times the
cube root of x so in order to simplify
any radical we want to take the radicand
and split it up into its factors if a
factor appears the same number of times
as the index of the root then that means
we can pull one of it out that was why
we could pull out one x one y and one
watt we multiply all those factors
together and leave any single or lonely
factors inside of the radical this will
give us our final answer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
