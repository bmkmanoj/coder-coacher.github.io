and believe it or not I came to an
answer by two completely diff ways okay
did they agree they happen to agree but
one of them is kind of lame it's sort of
the thing that you would do if you were
doing the s80 or the GRE and you wanted
to quickly get a guess at the answer oh
I see and it's that k very small K and
very big k are kind of both easy it's
the one in the middle where it gets hard
and so any function that depends on K
directly in a way whereas k gets bigger
gets harder as Kate gets smaller gets
easier is probably not right which made
me think it was probably in cubed and so
then I try to think about how the
algorithm work and so the worst case way
of thinking about the algorithm is at
every single time you have to figure out
which two points are closest to one
another all right hang on a second so
we're going to repeat k times and the
hard case is when it's like in over two
ish right right and what what is it that
we do at each step well we find the two
closest points good right and that and
how long and yeah and how long does that
take it's exactly it's N squared because
you have to do all possible combinations
it's a little better than N squared
right it's you know but it's big o of N
squared right and it's possible that if
we store those distances really cleverly
we can get it down a bit more but but
yeah and squared seems like a like Oh a
nice way to characterize it so don't we
don't we need to do some work to merge
the clusters together so that the next
time through we get the right set of
distances that we're looking through we
could do that and that would work fine
and that's probably that's probably the
right thing to do but just kind of at a
high level what you just really want to
do is you want to find the closest two
points that have two different labels
okay so what I associate with every with
every object X is the label that it
currently has so you're going to look at
each pair ignore it if the labels are
the same on both of the clusters that
the two objects are in and otherwise
find the minimum right and I can connect
it works and I can do that in time
linear in the number of pairs so it's
still in squared I don't have a sort or
anything like that true though we could
it could be a little bit smarter to not
reconsider the same pairs over and over
and over again that's right you could
if you could you could probably use
something fancy like Fibonacci heaps or
hash tables or something and in fact I
know that there are people who've gotten
entire PhDs on clever ways of doing this
without having to consider all points by
dividing points up into little boxes
where they are where things tend to be
closer to one another it actually looks
a lot very hierarchical as well fair
enough okay so we do part we do we do a
that takes n squared time how many times
do we do a well we do it about n times
all right so that gets us the N cubed is
it clear that the other ones are
definitely wrong well since we can do
this in N squared time and the number of
clusters can be large the first one is a
bad answer the second one is a bad
answer but the last one is it is it
possible that we could actually do this
in linear time um no the well first for
very small or very big k maybe like so k
equals 1 yes that's easy that's linear k
equals in that's easy because we started
out that way I say but for in between
case because you still have to find the
closest distance and there's you have to
find distance is another way to do that
is to consider all the distances yeah at
the very least the number of inputs that
you need to even sniff at is quadratic
because the D can be any kind of
structure so yeah okay so this is really
the only answer that that is even close
but I think it could come down a little
bit from n cubed oh I'm sure could I
mean because I just came up with the
silliest that the simplest algorithm you
could think of that wasn't absolutely
stupid so I think that would you could
certainly be better than n cubed but not
much better than n cubed all right end
of quiz yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
