attendance per grade in this case we've
added a third column grade to our data
so each row now represents for a given
date and a given grade how many students
attended school in that day now if d3 or
whichever library were using they
implement some of the principles of the
grammar of graphics wasn't so flexible
if we've added another column to our
data and it was tightly coupled to how
we represented it we may have to redo a
bunch of work we previously done to draw
the same lines to draw the same axis but
in our case and we'll see later when I
go through some live code examples
adding another column or in this case a
categorical variable allows us to keep a
lot of our aesthetic and reapply that
aesthetic in this case three times one
for each grade and if our data set had
grade 12 in it we would have a separate
line for 9th 10th and 11th grade
something interesting we see here is
that it appears 10th graders were not
affected by the flu while we have 9th
and 11th graders with the severe dip in
attendance during the later winter
months 10th graders for whatever reason
have seemed to avoided the flu do the
flexibility of the grammar of graphics
we were able to apply the same aesthetic
in this case a line and the same axis
two different data in this case data
that has a grade column added and is
categorized by day so instead of having
to redo all the work of specifying how
to draw a line and how it integrates
with our data we've simply split up our
data by grade and drawn one line for
each category in this case the grade</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
