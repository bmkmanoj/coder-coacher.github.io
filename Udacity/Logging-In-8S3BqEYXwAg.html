accounts in our backend so that's cool
but none of them can actually log in
before my roommates start a riot let's
add some login functionality here's a
quick overview of what happens behind
the scenes when you log in with firebase
in the code for your app you'll call off
with password this sends a message to
your online firebase database to try to
authenticate the user the online
firebase database has a hidden
credential data store which includes
hashes of emails and passwords of users
that have been created in your firebase
firm base is doing the hard work of
actually checking the credentials and if
successful it creates something called a
off data object and a JSON web token
this JSON web token also called a JWT is
a token that is automatically stored for
you by the firebase SDK it gets stored
in local storage for your app and this
survives between a free loads it's this
token that allows your user to stay
logged in even if they close and then
reopen the app and again this part is
all automatically taken care of for you
so you don't really need to worry about
j WTS or doing anything with them the
auth data object on the other hand is
something that's explicitly returned to
your code and it's an object that
contains basic data about the user so
then when you get the off data object
back in your app you could use its data
to update your UI as a developer from
your vantage point all you really have
to do is call this method here and then
get our off data object back the rest of
this is handled by firebase</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
