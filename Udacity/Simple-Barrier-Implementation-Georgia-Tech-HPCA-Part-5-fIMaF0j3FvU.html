implementation of a barrier in a program
so this is our barrier implementation
our counter is a shared variable and
everybody's trying to increment it when
they arrive to the barrier multiple
threads could arrive to the barrier at
about the same time so we have to
protect the counter using a lock so here
what we are really doing is counting the
arrivals once we are done incrementing
the counter we can check if the counter
is equal to the total if it is that
means that we are either the last read
or that the last read has arrived
note that the two are not necessarily
the same we may be able to increment the
counter but we are not the last read but
by the time we get to check the total
the last read has arrived and increments
the counter so we read the counter that
is not the same as what we left it with
either way if the counter is equal to
the total then we reset the counter
because it needs to be reinitialized so
that next time we enter the same barrier
variable we have the count at 0 and we
set the release flag to 1 so that the
threads who are waiting find out that
the barrier can now be released if the
count is not equal to the total then
we're gonna spin here waiting for
somebody else to find that the count is
equal to the total and release after we
are done going through one instance of
this barrier the release will be 1
before we can reuse this barrier the
release needs to be set at 0 and that's
the purpose of this line here if we are
the first read to arrive then we're
gonna set release to 0 so the idea is
now that as we enter the barrier the
first read that arrives and note that
this is done in a critical section so
exactly one thread will see this as 0 it
set release to 0 that read and
increments the count it becomes 1 and
then goes on here that thread and all
the other threads now see release as 0
and the only way it becomes one is if
count reaches the total so what happens
is the first thread might actually be
delayed and read the count after
everybody is done in which case it's
going to do this or
might go here and spin but either way
release becoming one means that somebody
got to this point which is when the
barrier should be released one or more
threads that arrive towards the end are
gonna do this which will reset the count
so that next time we enter we see count
zero and release is set to one which
ensures that those threads that did end
up here are gonna see release as one
note that the meaning of the spin
release equals one is actually that we
wait for release to be one it turns out
that this barrier code is not entirely
correct if two threads are synchronizing
on this barrier the total will be two
and the barrier actually works the first
time so the thread one reaches the
barrier and so does thread two now they
synchronize on this barrier and that
will work but if we try to continue work
and then synchronize on the same barrier
variable again we would expect that this
setting of the count of zero and this
setting of the release to zero to work
but it doesn't always work so this is
not an entirely correct implementation
of a barrier that can be used more than
once</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
