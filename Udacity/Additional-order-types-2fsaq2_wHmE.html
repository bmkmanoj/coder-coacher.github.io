orders besides just buy and sell market
and limit it turns out though that the
exchanges only execute these types of
orders they don't execute those other
types
well you might wonder okay how do those
other types of orders come into being
these other types of orders are
implemented by your broker the way that
works is you enter this order type and
I'll give you a couple examples in just
a second the broker holds that order and
watches the market until the conditions
that you specified are met and then when
those conditions are met the broker
sends your order to the market
accordingly so here are some examples
stop-loss is a kind of order where you
say when the stock drops to a certain
price I want you to sell it
stop gain similarly when the stock
reaches a certain higher price I want
you to sell it
trailing stop is a combination of
stop-loss but also an automatically
changing value for when that criteria is
met so for instance you might have this
trailing stop remain say ten cents
behind the price so as the price goes up
the value at which you would want to
sell the stock goes up along with the
price but when it drops down below then
that stop-loss is triggered but probably
the most important and most impactful
kind of order the brokers implement for
you is something called selling short
what's selling short allows you to do is
take a negative position on a stock in
other words you sell a stock short if
you believe it's price is going to go
down keep in mind here we're selling
stock we don't even own so how is that
possible
well again it's possible because the
broker facilitates it for you and I'll
explain how in just a minute</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
