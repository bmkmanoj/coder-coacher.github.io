bit about approximating vertex cover
suppose someone comes up to you and
tells you that they've devised a really
really clever algorithm for
approximating vertex cover let's call it
clever vc now this is so clever that
they don't actually want to show you the
source code they want to keep it secret
so you can't see that then they don't
even return the list of vertices that
are in the cover they just tell you the
size of the cover so how would you go
about figuring out the performance of
this and how it works in order to test
the performance of clever VC how about
we test it against for fairly large
graphs of 10,000 20,000 30,000 and
40,000 vertices and let's compare that
against effect two approximation
algorithm that we have see what the size
that both come up with are so you can
see that the size of the minimum vertex
cover for clever VC is always smaller
than our factor two approximation
sometimes by not very much for example
in this run 233 versus 234 not much of a
difference in other cases it's a rather
large difference like 295 versus 600 in
the 30,000 vertice graph now based on
this table there are a number of things
that we can say about clever VC and
these are the questions that I'd like
you to answer for me the statements that
we can definitely say about clever VC
and if you need to refer back to the
table then we'll have that below in the
instructor comments can we say that
given any graph clever VC will
outperform the two approximation
algorithm since in the graphs that we
gave it it most certainly did outperform
are two approximation algorithm now can
we also say that clever vc is a factor
1.75 approximation algorithm or finally
could we actually say that clever VC is
not a correct algorithm and check true
or false for all three of these</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
