controller it is open source stable and
widely used there are two flavors of
Knox classic Knox and the new Knox
classic Knox was written in C++ and
Python and is no longer supported the
new Knox is C++ only the code base is
fast clean and well supported more
information about Knox is available at
Knox repo org in a Knox Network there
may be a set of switches and various
network attached servers the controller
maintains a network view and the
controller may also run several
applications that operate on that
network view the basic abstraction that
Knox supports is a switch control
abstraction where open flow is the
prevailing protocol control is defined
at the granularity of flows which are
defined by at n-tuple in the original
open flow specification so depending on
whether a particular packet matches a
subset of value specified as a flow rule
the controller may make different
decisions for packets that belong to
different parts of flow space or packets
that match different subsets of the
fields defined by a flow a flow is
defined by the header or the tenn tubule
which I just alluded to a counter which
maintains statistics and actions that
should be performed on packets that
match this particular flow definition
actions might include forwarding the
packet dropping it or sending it to the
controller when a switch receives a
packet it updates its counters for
counting packets that belong to that
flow and applies the corresponding
actions for that flow which might
include forwarding dropping or sending
to a controller the basic programmatic
interface for the Knox controller is
based on
Vince a controller knows how to process
different types of events such as a
switch join or leave a packet in or a
packet received event should the switch
redirect the packet to the controller as
well as various statistics the
controller also keeps track of a network
view which includes a view of the
underlying network topology and it also
speaks a control protocol to the
switches in the network that control
protocol effectively allows the
controller to update the state in the
network switches the NOx controller
implements the OpenFlow protocol NOx is
implemented in C++ and it supports open
flow 1.0 a fork of NOx called cpqd
supports versions 1.1 1.2 and 1.3 the
programming model is event base and a
programmer can write an application by
writing event handlers for the NOx
controller NOx provides good performance
but requires you to understand and be
comfortable with the facilities and
semantics of low-level open flow
commands later in this module we will
explore controllers based on PI Redick
and frenetic that do not have this
characteristic NOx also requires the
programmer to write the control
application in C++ which can be slow for
development and debugging to address the
shortcomings that are associated with
development in C++ pox was developed pox
is widely used maintained and supported
it's also easy to use and easy to read
and write the control programs of course
as might come with implementing a
controller and Python the performance of
pox is not as good as the performance of
NOx</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
