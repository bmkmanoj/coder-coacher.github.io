animals who are able to answer this
question so admittedly i used wikipedia
a little bit to find out some of these
answers but we know that eagles lay eggs
bloopers lay eggs penguins lay oh lay
eggs and they all have wings eagles and
bluebirds have talons whereas penguins
kind of have more up flippers because
they swim so I don't really have talons
I eagles and bluebirds also fly whereas
penguins don't fly none of them have fur
and we might say that Eagles and
penguins are large whereas bluebirds are
not very large our definition of large
is kind of variable it's kind of
subjective but if we were going to draw
a line somewhere it's reasonable to say
that Bluebird is definitely on the
smaller end of the spectrum good David
you know more about these animals that I
do imagine that the three animals were
given as examples one after the other so
we are back to incremental concept
learning of the previous lesson one can
use the techniques that we learned in
the previous lesson to learn some
equivalence class learn some concept
definition with these three animals but
that's not the point here the point here
is not about the learning of the concept
the point here is much more about the
nature of the concepts and how they get
organized related to each other</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
