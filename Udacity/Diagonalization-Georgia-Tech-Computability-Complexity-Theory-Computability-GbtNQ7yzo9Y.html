many contexts and is very useful for
generating paradoxes and mathematical
contradictions to show how general the
technique is let's examine it in the
context of English adjectives here I've
created a table with English adjectives
both as the rows and as the columns
consider the road to be the word itself
and the column to be the string
representation of the word for each
entry I've written a 1 if the row
adjective applies to the column
representation of the word for instance
long is not a long word so I've written
a 0 polysyllabic is a long word so I've
written a 1 French is not a French word
it's an English word so I've written a 0
and so forth so far we haven't run into
any problems now let's make the
following definition a heterological
word is a word that expresses a property
that it's representation does not
possess we can add the representation of
the word to the table without any
problems it is a long poly syllabic non
French word but when we try to add the
meaning to the table we run into
problems remember a heterological word
is one that expresses a property that
it's representation does not possess
long is not a long word so it is
heterological polysyllabic is a
polysyllabic word so it is not
heterological
French is not a French word so it is
heterological
in effect we've taken the values along
this diagonal and flip them to create
this row
what about heterological however if we
say that this is heterological causing
us to put a 1 here then it applies to
itself so it can't be heterological
on the other hand if we say that it is
not heterological causing us to put a 0
here then it doesn't apply to itself and
it is heterological so there really is
no satisfactory answer here
heterological is not well defined as an
adjective for English adjectives we tend
simply to ignore the paradox and
politely say that we can't answer that
question even in mathematics the polite
response
was simply to ignore such questions
until around the turn of the 20th
century when philosophers began to look
for more solid logical foundations for
reasoning and for mathematics in
particular naively one might think that
a set could be an arbitrary collection
but what about the set of all sets that
do not contain themselves is this set a
member of itself or not this paradox
posed by Bertrand Russell wasn't
satisfactorily resolved until the 1920s
with the formulation of what we now call
Zermelo Fraenkel set theory or from
mathematical logic consider the
statement this statement is false if
this statement is true then it says that
it's false and if the statement is false
then it says so and should be true it
turns out that falsehood in this sense
isn't well-defined mathematically at
this point you've probably guessed where
this is going for this course we're
going to apply the diagonalization trick
to Turing machines</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
