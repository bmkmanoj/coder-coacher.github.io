with our web server and that's that we
don't want to crawl the web every time
we start the web application we want to
crawl the web once store it in a file
read that file and then be able to start
the server without needing to do any
crawls so what we'd like to do is move
the actual crawling out of the server
replace this with something that just
loads a file and turns that file into a
web corpus object so that means we need
something that creates that file and
we're going to put that in the crawler
module so here's how we're going to
modify our code this is the crawler PI
module and we're going to add to it so
when we run it from the command line
when we run it as the main and this is
one way to test for that if the name
this is a built-in defined by python is
equal to main that means we ran this
code directly what we want to do is do
the crawl and write the corpus to a file
that'll be a file that we can load in
the server to create the web corpus
subject we could do this ourselves we
could add a method to web corpus that
would output the object in a way that
could be stored in a file just using the
file write operations that we've seen
and we could have another method that
would read it this would be quite a bit
of work we'd have to walk the entire
structure to store it there's actually
an easier way to do that that's built
into Python and the way to do it is
called pickling this is one of my
favorite modules built into Python what
the pickle module allows us to do is
take any object actually almost any
object we won't get into the ones that
it doesn't work on pickle it and we can
do that by using pickle dump that takes
in an object and the file this will
store the object in a file we can store
that on just we could mail that around
we could do anything we want with it
then when we want to get the object back
we can do pickled load testing in the
file and magically we'll get back
essentially the same object that we
started with if this file was created by
someone you don't trust well they could
create a file so when you one pickle it
you get an object back that does things
you don't like it could potentially run
any arbitrary code so only use this with
files you trust in this case we're going
to create the file ourselves and hope
that no one else modifies it and use it
in our search engine so we're going to
do this in two quizzes the first where
you'll dump the file and the second
where you do the load</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
