project you can actually use the super
convenient libgdx project setup utility
we actually included it at the root of
the course code it's called GTX setup
jar if you want to download the setup
app for yourself you can just search for
libgdx this first results the one you
want select download and select download
setup app if you get this alert saying
that GTX setup can't be open because
it's by an unidentified developer you
can fix that by opening up your system
preferences going to security and
privacy and checking the radio button
for allow apps downloaded from anywhere
now the setup app needs some information
to configure our new project we'll give
it the name icicles we use the package
Commodus be gamedev icicles we'll name
the game class icicles game destination
is where the project setup utility will
create your new project we'll just say
desktop slash icicles next the project
setup utility needs the path of your
Android software development kit if you
don't remember where that is you can
open up the Preferences pane of Android
studio search for SDK and then up in
this box here you'll find the path of
your SDK we'll just copy that and we'll
paste it into the libgdx project setup
utility next you can select what version
of libgdx you'd like to use you almost
always just want to use the most recent
then you need to decide what sub
projects you want to include unless
you're using some particular extension
that doesn't support all the different
sub projects you should probably just
include them all it's much easier to
remove a platform you don't plan to
support later than it is to add in a new
platform finally you can include various
extensions box2d is included by default
it's a super powerful 2d physics engine
and we'll end up using that in a later
course but uncheck that for now finally
hit generate 42 seconds later we have a
successful build let's go load up our
new project as usual we open up Android
studio and select import project we can
hit this button to jump to the desktop
here's the icicles folder we just
created now it looks like we're all
loaded up let's open up the terminal and
we can run the desktop run task to see
what we've got
all right looks like the default project
just comes with the red background and
bad logic games logo awesome now you can
create whatever new projects you want
and you don't have to rely on our
starter code in the course repository</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
