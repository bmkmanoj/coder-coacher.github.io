disability are really not fair because
IQ is not the same thing as creativity
in fact you can have disability
cognitive or intellectual disability and
yet have extreme talents and this is
best seen in savants savants are people
who do in fact have disability and yet
extreme and uncanny talents kim peak is
one of the better known examples of a
savant kim peak for instance could read
a page in 8 to 10 seconds that takes us
three or four minutes to read and he
could remember 98% of it up to years and
years later exactly what was on that
page he also could tell you precisely
what day of the week you were born on if
you give him your birthday he could also
tell you what your zip code was if you
give him your address
and yet he couldn't dress himself and
nor could he understand metaphor so for
instance the phrase get ahold of
yourself didn't really make sense to him
so do you think that Kim Peaks IQ is a
valid indicator of how smart he is</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
