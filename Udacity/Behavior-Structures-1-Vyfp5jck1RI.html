try to create learning algorithms that
are not quite as smart as you were in
that example but you know trying to
approximate that getting getting as far
along the you know rock to Charles
continuum as we possibly can okay we
want algorithms that are Charles
complete uh no I think you're probably
still going to be the algorithms that
we're going to talk about in this clasp
someday someday all right so so the
important thing is that we have to
figure out what it is that we are trying
to learn so in this case what we're
trying to learn as a behavior we're
trying to learn a way of interacting
with the environment that obtains high
reward and it turns out that there's
different ways to think about this
depending on what kind of behavior you
are looking for so one classical kind of
behavior that is very common in the AI
literature is the notion of a plan so a
plan usually refers to a fixed sequence
of action so the kind of the kind of
thing that says okay I see where i am
now this is the sequence of things I'm
going to do I'm going to go left right
up up up down pick up left left down to
add data and drop off something like
that so that that plan is once you've
chosen the plan you can just execute it
it's just that fixed sequence of actions
and this happens sometimes in real life
we there's certain kinds of behaviors
that we just have memorized as a
sequence but in fact one what's a
problem with this why can't we in
general just execute plans in order to
satisfy the kind of goals that we're
trying to satisfy well so I'll say two
things one is I was actually executing a
plan once I figured out what was going
on mmm right yeah it is you all right so
right so there's part of it is during
learning you don't know stuff so you
don't know what kind of plan to execute
for this slide I'm talking about
behavior structures for after learning
so during learning all sorts of weird
things have to happen you have to try
stuff out you have to adapt but once
you've figured out what you want to do
you could try to represent it as a plan
but the problem with that okay so you're
so it is true the environment that I
showed you has a property that makes
plans actually okay yeah it's it's
deterministic for for one thing so that
was the second thing I was going to say
which is that the plan worked because
everything
did as I expected it to do it was
deterministic good good and so in
stochastic environments you need to be
at least a little bit of aware of your
surroundings you need to move around
with your eyes open and so one step in
that direction is something called a
conditional plan so you can think of a
conditional plan is actually being a
kind of program where a plan is a fixed
program or just execute the sequence of
statements a conditional plan can have
if statements in it you can sort of see
what's happening in your environment I'm
going to do this this this is this and
if I get to this point and such and such
is true then I'll go this way and start
these actions otherwise I'll try these
things in these actions right so could
one of your if things be if everything
works out the way I expected keep going
if it ever doesn't then stop and try to
figure out a new plan usually that's not
thought of that way the conditional plan
would be something where you have that
sequence and then there's a branch point
we know we ask a question and we could
can you know if everything's gone okay
continue the way we've been going but if
not then a conditional plan has an else
statement right it tells you what you
should do in case that that's not true
or in case it's something else is true
okay what you're talking about is
something more akin to dynamic
replanning where the idea is exactly
what you said we're just going to
continue along the plan making
predictions about what's supposed to
happen next if those predictions are
violated we just generate a new plan so
there's nothing in the plan that says
here's what I do in case things break
instead we wait for something to break
and then we react to it okay that's just
in time conditional planning just in
time planning really cuz the condition
again the conditionals aren't in there
fair enough fair enough I like that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
