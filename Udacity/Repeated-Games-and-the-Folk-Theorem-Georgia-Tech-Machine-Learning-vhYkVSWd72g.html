trying to understand the folk theorem
and and what it says and how it works is
a thing that I call a two-player plot I
don't know if other people have other
names for it but this this concept is
out and and often discussed I just don't
know what it's called but here's the
idea of it it's a really simple idea
it's like a folk plot it is a it is a
folk folk plot right I don't know who
invented this plot so here's what we're
gonna do remember this prisoner's
dilemma game we've got two players
there's smooth and curly mm-hm and what
we're gonna do is there's a bunch of
joint actions that they can take so
smooth cooperates and curly to facts or
they both to fact or they both cooperate
or one defects and defect cooperate in
the other direction so what we're gonna
do is for each of those joint outcomes
each of those joint action choices I'm
gonna plot a dot put a dot on a
two-dimensional plot where this is the
smooth axis and this is the curly axis
okay
okay so cooperate cooperate remember
from the prisoner prisoner dilemma
payoffs is minus 1 minus 1 so I put a
dot at minus 1 minus 1 defect effect is
it minus 6 minus 6 cooperate defect is
at minus 9 0
and defect cooperate is at 0 minus sign
so do those four points make sense to
you to understand the idea they do it
may not be so obvious why we do it this
way because as you've told us the matrix
is all you need mm-hmm but this is
really just representing the matrix in
another form but it actually is sort of
losing some information because these
dots don't tell us what the relationship
is in terms of if if one player keeps
the same action and the other player
changes to a different action the matrix
captures that but this plot doesn't
anymore it's kind of washed out I see</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
