with your request by trying to go
through and exercise with you where we
try to figure out what these options are
and there's going to be a secret point
here that has to do as always with
abstraction so here's what I do so we've
got the same little grid world that we
had before up here but I have introduced
another grid world do you recognize this
grid world it looks like a very tiny
little game of pac-man it is exactly a
tiny little game of pac-man so what I
want to do with this tiny little game of
pac-man which again it's just a grid
world is I want to explore this notion
of options and see what we can figure
out about them so everybody remembers
pac-man so Michael for the benefit of
the audience that has never played
pac-man all 0 of them why don't you
explain to us how pac-man works sure so
in the game we're a little Jewish guy
named Pakman and we're running around in
the grid where the yellow guy and we tom
tom tom tom tom we can't go through the
blue walls we're being pursued by it
looks like what sort of careful yeah i'm
going to go with the french fry goblins
from mcdonalds so as we move around in
the grid we consume those little dots
the little pellets and that gives us the
points if we can actually clear all the
little dots and the big dots from the
screen then we have successfully
completed the screen and we get an even
more exciting challenge next yes but I
want to say that there's one other
important thing is that if we eat one of
those power pellets the big fat dots yep
then the tables are turned on our ghost
friends and we can actually if we touch
them consume them we get points and then
they have to there I believe their
eyeballs run away and regenerate yes as
exactly what happens just like in real
life so yeah so the ghosts touch us we
die unless we've had the power pellets
and then they allow us to eat the ghosts
but only for a limited amount of time
right it doesn't last forever oh good
well I hit a big fat pellet I don't get
to do it for the rest of the game it
lasts for some amount of time for a
limited time only limited time only and
I don't remember that time is fixer of
that time
a random I think it's fixed but maybe
not and you know there are different
versions of packing in that have
slightly different rules but those are
the basic rules so here's the exercise I
want to go through now obviously and
when I say obvious I'm saying that to be
done anyone who doesn't think it's
obvious there are four atomic actions
left right up and down or south east and
west just like in any other grid world
and that's pretty much what we're given
so here's the exercise I want you to go
through it's got sort of two parts to it
and this is actually an exercise that we
have done with other people as a part of
studies we've done I want you to think
about options that you might create here
like if you were going to describe to a
human being here are the things you need
to accomplish here the things you need
to do in this game in order to play it
and play it well presumably what kind of
actions would you come up with so I'm
asking you to do the same thing that I
asked you to do before what you said
well go to the doorway go to the doorway
and you know did that kind of things I'm
actually do the same thing here but
impact mainly sure I could get that a
try I mean I feel like in some ways this
is this is harder than the other example
because it was it was nice to be able to
just navigate to that plus 1 and know
that the you know our task was complete
here there's a lot of things going on
yeah but you're gonna have to simplify
it for me and so abstract away simplify
forming</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
