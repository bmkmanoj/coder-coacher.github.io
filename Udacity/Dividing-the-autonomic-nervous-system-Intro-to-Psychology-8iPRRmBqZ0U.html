further divide the autonomic nervous
system into sympathetic and
parasympathetic so essentially the
autonomic nervous system is our
self-governing system because what it
regulates we have little control over
for example it controls things like
heart rate or blood pressure even
digestion but I'm going to bring Susan
in to ask her a few questions because I
think that the sympathetic and
parasympathetic is a difference between
automatically arriving us up or call me
as down you're right Lauren under the
autonomic nervous system we have both
our sympathetic and parasympathetic the
sympathetic is often termed our
fight-or-flight response
when we are encountered with stressful
or dangerous situations this is the
nervous system that's going to be
activated that is an opposite from the
parasympathetic here we talk about the
normally relaxed state so if you are
relaxing digesting your food this would
be our parasympathetic however if there
is a stressful response the sympathetic
nervous system will automatically be
activated here we'll see that we will no
longer have blood going to our gut to
digest our food instead that blood is
going to go to our muscles which will
allow us to fight or to flee it is
important to note however that the
sympathetic nervous system cannot be
activated indefinitely there will be a
time in which it has to rest so we can
replenish the neurotransmitters that
have been released during this
fight-or-flight response
we'll talk about neurotransmitters
