going to teach you now and it has to do
with the idea that not all unique words
are actually different or not very
different anyway let me show you an
example of what I mean say in my corpus
I have a bunch of different versions of
the word respond where the meaning
changes ever so slightly based on the
context or based on the part of speech
that the word is but they're all talking
about basically the same idea the idea
of someone or something responding the
idea is that if I now usually put these
into a bag of words they're all going to
show up as different features even
though they're all getting it roughly
the same idea and this is going to be
true for many words in a lot of
languages that they have lots of
different permutations that mean only
slightly different things luckily for us
there's a way of sort of bundling these
up together and representing them as a
single word and the way that that
happens is using an algorithm called a
stemmer so if I were to wrap up all of
these words and put them into a stemmer
it would then apply a function to them
that would strip them down all to the
have the same sort of route which might
be something like respawn so the idea is
not necessarily to make a single word
out of this because of course respond
isn't a word but it's kind of the root
of a word or the stem of a word that can
then be used in any of our classifiers
or our regressions and we've now taken
this five dimensional input space and
turn it into one dimension without
losing any real information now stemming
functions can actually be kind of tricky
to implement yourself there are
professional linguists and computational
linguists who build these stemming
functions that best figure out what is
the stem of a given word and so usually
what we do in machine learning is we
take one of these stem errs off the
shelf from something like an LT K or
some other similar text processing
package and we just make use of it not
necessarily always going into the guts
of how it works and then once we've
applied the stemming of course we have a
much cleaner body of vocabulary that we
can work with</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
