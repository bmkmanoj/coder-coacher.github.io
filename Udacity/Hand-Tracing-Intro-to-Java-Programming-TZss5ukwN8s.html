and understand several loops and it will
often happen to you that you have a loop
that's really mysterious and I'll give
you an example here's some code that
comes from a program that you will
improve in a bit to solve a common
problem namely to identify reverse
digits in a credit card so let's see
what this code does what you always want
to do is get out a sheet of paper here's
my sheet of paper you make a table one
column for every variable as a variable
n there's a variable sum now it's always
a good idea to take a marker I like to
use a paper clip to mark where we are so
we set N to 365 we set the sum to 0 now
we enter the loop is n greater than 0 it
sure is we get to the statement now we
need to compute n modulo 10 that's the
last digit of n that would be 5 and now
we have a new variable we record it I
put in the 5 moving on some is some plus
digit n is n divided by 10 it's an
integer division so we discard the
remainder we move to the top of the loop
is n greater than 0
compute n mod 10 36 more 10 is 6 store
that in the digit sum is sum plus digit
it is 11 n is n what 10 now n is 3 back
to the top of the loop is 3 greater than
0 it barely is so we stay in the loop
now we need to take 3 mod 10 that's 3
add it to the sum divide n by 10 that's
an integer division so now we get 0 0 is
no longer greater than 0 we fall out of
the loop and go to this statement and
what are we printing printing 14 ok what
was 14 well we've computed all of the
digits of the number 365 3 the six to
five and we've computed this one 14 is
the sum of the digits and that's almost
what one needs to do in order to verify
a credit card you'll see in your next
programming assignment what sum of
digits you exactly need to do</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
