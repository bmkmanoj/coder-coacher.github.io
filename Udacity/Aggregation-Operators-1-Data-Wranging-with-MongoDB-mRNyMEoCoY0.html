operators group and sort there are
several others in addition to these two
I'm going to go through each one briefly
to explain how it works I'll just
summarize them here later we'll dig into
each one individually and I'll show you
what it does
alright so the first operator will look
at is project I put together some dummy
data here that we can use as we talk
about each one of these operators now
the project operator allows you to shape
documents it receives as input into what
you need for the next stage the simplest
form of shaping is using project to
select which fields you're interested in
exactly like we did in the last lesson
when projecting out the motto for cities
and other single fields we were
interested in looking at so for example
here if in the documents I received to
my stage in which I'm using the project
operator I'm interested say in this
field and perhaps this one as well then
I can use the project operator to simply
pull out these individual values
regardless of where they're nested in
the input documents and project them out
in documents into the next stage of the
pipeline or the result if I'm at the end
of the pipeline well look at the syntax
for project a little bit later
essentially with project I can take the
fields I receive in an individual
document and perform a number of
different types of operations on them in
order to produce documents for the next
stage of the pipeline select is one I
could also say for example as we'll look
at later produce a ratio based on two
numeric fields and create a new field
that will then be passed on in documents
to the next stage of the pipeline the
next operator I want to look at is match
match filters documents so for example I
might set up some match criteria that
would cause me to end up filtering so
that I only ended up with this document
and this document from the documents I
was passed as input to my aggregation
stage using the match operator I can of
course also group and sort and we looked
at a pretty detailed example for both of
these so I won't go into further detail
here so the next operator I'd like to
cover is skip skip is designed to allow
us to simply skip over a certain number
of documents at the beginning of our in
put set of documents to the aggregation
stage using skip so for example if I
wanted to skip the first three input
documents then the first document I
would output would be this one and all
documents following it limit kind of
does the reverse of Skip so in this case
if I limited what I was passing on to
the next stage of the pipeline to three
documents then what I would be doing is
simply taking those three documents and
filtering out everything else</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
