here and it actually brings back some
really great memories when i was 10 i
was on a television show outside of WGBH
in Boston which is where I grew up and I
was one of five panelists that had
disabilities and we filmed for two years
and it was a real coming of age
experience for me because we were asked
to sit on very hot sets talking about
how do you feel about being different
how do you feel about being teased and
not only was I saving in Psychological
costs I didn't have to see a shrink I
was actually being paid for talking
about my feelings and I really bonded
with the other four individuals and it
was really neat unfortunately we did not
stay on air for the two years but
scholastic educational services picked
us up and this was right when the
mainstreaming act was really coming into
play when I started kindergarten I was
not allowed to go to the local school I
had to go to a special school even
though intellectually I'm no different
than you are but the mainstreaming act
took place in 1972 and at five first
grade I was then able to go to our local
public school so jump ahead seven or
eight years which is when we were
filming feeling free that the thought
was we have to expose the public to
diversity so that students can become
comfortable when these other students
are suddenly sitting in the desk next to
theirs so it was a really neat
experience my other panelist or friends
I guess would be the better word we we
did audition and so they were able to
get some really awesome articulate kids
one had cerebral palsy one became blind
during the process of our show and so
that was very interesting to befriend
somebody that's I when I first met her
could see and when we finished could not
see at all and remind me again how over
you this I was 10 10 to 12 right in
those clothes
he'll years yeah so it was this the same
age where you were noticing I mean how
old were you when you sort of notice
yourself that you were different from
other people and maybe when your parents
also notice this that's a really good
question my parents were given the
diagnosis when I was 18 months old and
they wonder to this day whether or not
that was a delayed diagnosis that no one
had the heart to break it to them now
this was pre DNA testing this was all
based on x-rays and femur length femur
is what they really go for in measuring
the femur length and there we were
sitting in Boston one of the top medical
communities in the country and the
gentleman that gave my parents the
diagnosis was t berry Brazelton who was
sort of the doctor Spock not the sci-fi
dr. Spock but sort of the the pediatric
Voice of America in the 70s and so I
love to tell people that I was diagnosed
by that man myself so they knew when I
was 18 months old I think many little
people like myself do not come to their
own realization until they're in school
because that's when the teasing really
starts and the accessibility if you will
especially back then you know we're
talking about the 70s there wasn't any
Americans with Disability Act so that's
when I was having to struggle to access
what my fellow students were accessing
did you notice so um what kind of
experiences you have with other students
was it entirely negative from the
beginning I mean did work people you
know where kids mean where they did they
teased a lot did they you know did they
just sort of look unsure you know seeing
something different from themselves what
kind of interaction was it and did it
change as you went through schooling
luckily I grew up in a very educated
community you know uh 30 minutes away
from MIT Harvard you know all of the Ivy
League's in boston and i think that's
that speaks a lot to
kids and their value in that value
system but their manners and so forth so
I don't remember getting teased too much
i'm sure i did and how much of that i
have sort of put under the surface and
forgotten about but i don't i have a
tougher time even today when i'm in an
inner city environment where my the
people surrounding me don't have the
same etiquette and don't have the same
education the same exposure and that's
really where i struggle more than where
i grew up in a suburb of Boston um well
to get a bit more of that sort of
educated thought and idea um I want you
to tell us um you know as a medical
condition of dwarfism what is what do
you know is the cause of shorter stature
and in particular in your case what is
the what is the cause of this well
remember they're over 200 different
types of dwarfism achondroplasia being
the most common so if you were to meet
another little person in your life most
likely they'll have a condor pleasure so
I can only really speak to a condor
pleasure it is a dominant gene it is
also a mutation so what that means is an
individual can have a condor pleasure
for two reasons one would be their
parents have it and it's been inherited
as it was with my children the other
would be it's a genetic mutation which
is a complete unexplained event which is
what it was for me I am the only little
person in my family my little brother is
63 and my parents my grandfather was a
genealogist so you can imagine he spent
a lot of time looking into this and I am
the only Wharf in my family of origin
but I then went on to meet my husband
who also has a condo pleasure we got
married and we have three children I
gave birth to two of them and I flew to
Moscow for the third one to adopt from
an orphanage who also has a condor
pleasure but clearly not from me or my
husband she from all we know which is
really not much is a mutation as well
her parents were average height
I suspect in Russia it's a lot harder to
be a little person sure yeah are you
familiar with the gene that is actually
mutated in most cases of achondroplasia
the FR the fgfr3 James that's what I am
okay there's a reason I don't teach
science I mean I'm an English and drama
teacher in Spanish teacher not a science
teacher so yes very familiar I don't
spend a whole lot of time conversing
about it what is really really cool is
that when the gene was discovered in
1994 in 1992 the National Convention was
in San Francisco I was eight months
pregnant we had both my in-laws there as
well as my parents and when we have a
national convention that little people
of America puts on a gaggle of health
care providers fly in that have
specialized or have an interest in
dwarfism and so there'll be no less than
15 or 20 geneticists from around the
country sometimes we even have
international dresses and we all
volunteered ourselves for a blood draw
when I was eight months pregnant and
they sent me home with the vial for
umbilical blood that I was when I was
going to give birth a month later so
that they could get and built umbilical
cord blood so I like to say we had a
little bit of something to do with the
discovery of the gene two years later
now on that note I have two children
that I gave birth to one in August of
1992 the other in November of 1997 the
gene was discovered in nineteen ninety
four or five so that meant that my
pregnancies were very very different in
1992 the only diagnostic tool that they
could use was ultrasound and again they
were looking at the femur in the fetus
and they could not measure that
accurately until I was twenty four weeks
pregnant so at that time they told me
and I was actually being seen by the
gentleman that
wrote the bird of the growth charts for
fetuses at UCSF and he was the one
reading my film my my measurements from
the ultrasound and he said Jenny this is
a tough one he said that femur is in the
seventh percentile and typically if
we're looking at a heterozygote meaning
that the embryo fetus has gotten the
gene from one of you that femur is going
to be over the 10th percentile right
around between the tenth and the 20 of
their 30th or something and you're
coming in at the seventh and that makes
us very concerned that perhaps you're
carrying a homozygous and a homozygote
what that means in later ms a
double-dominant many an achondroplasia
they have found that to be lethal the
baby is born and lives no more than a
week typically more a matter of hours
without life support so it was a really
tough call so we went ahead and went
with what we thought was right and Alex
was born and obviously he's still with
us he's 20 years old so he must be ahead
of his eigen although he has had a lot
of medical issues jump ahead five years
later and in between that by the way I
flew to Moscow to adopt the second child
I'm pregnant again with our now 15 year
old and I have an amniocentesis at 10
weeks and within a week I get a phone
call from a genetic counselor at baylor
university in Texas telling me you have
a head as i get one hundred percent
certainty so you can imagine the
difference in the stress involved around
both pregnancies so do you think it's a
in your mind knowing in advance is a
good thing you want to know even aside
from your case because there's also a
possibility that if your two
heterozygotes have children that neither
that a child gets booked does not get
the gene does not get a way that means
in lay terms as I could have had you you
could have been my chocolate exact I
would have been 15 but nonetheless so
there is as much of a possibility that i
would have what we would
an average-sized child or even an above
average height shot I have friends that
are my sides very good friends whose
only child his son is six foot four so I
had as big of a chance of that as I had
of a lethal situation both of those
being twenty-five percent chance and
then I had a fifty percent chance of
having the headers I get where the kid
gets the gene from either me or my of my
husband and that's what we wound up with
we did never we never experienced the
homozygous thankfully thankfully
although I have many friends at have
what so I'd like to just maybe talk a
bit more about that because that seems
like it could be a challenge just I
guess first in your mind then knowing
having this information being able to
know this information up front right at
the beginning of your pregnancy early on
is that something that's important to
you in the process was that something
you were happy to know about or do you
wish you kind of couldn't find out maybe
until later I'm going to skirt that a
little bit and I'm going to talk about
it in third person because it's such a
personal choice I'm going to tell you
that I have friends that have fallen
into all of these different categories I
have one friend that buried three babies
and five years because they kept coming
up with that twenty-five percent chance
I have one friend who has to advertise
children so they came up with that 25
the other twenty-five percent twice and
I have friends that have said well we'll
never get pregnant because we don't want
a dwarf child we went through so much
ourselves we would never want that for a
child I have friends that say I'm scared
to death of having an average-sized
child which I don't understand because I
teach high school you know that is not a
big deal and I have these great friends
in LA whose son is I just told you is
six foot four so you know this this
choice that we are now given or access
to this technology maybe is is very very
powerful I'm going to tell you a quick
story we had a regional conference in
Los Angeles about a year ago three women
all in their 20s all kind of grew up
together by default i mean not necessary
in the same town but because they're
little people of America members all of
their lives all pregnant now they all
have had the testing one of them did not
want to have the testing for religious
reasons but far along into the pregnancy
decided I don't want to go through the
baby showers I don't want to decorate a
nursery unless there's a reason to so
it's not going to change anything about
the pregnancy I'm going to go through
the pregnancy but I need to know and so
she knew she was carrying a
double-dominant and there she was with a
smile on her face with the other two
women one of whom had already buried a
double-dominant and was on her second
try and knew that that one I believe was
going to be average size and then the
third young woman knew that she was
having a heterozygote dwarf and there
they were all happy and talking and I
just the strength that the girl had that
knew she had a double-dominant inside of
her was just amazing it gets a little
bit more sad so the baby lived a few
hours they waited the three months they
were told to wait they got pregnant
again and again had a double-dominant
and kept it and that's their own choice
and aren't we lucky in this country that
we have choices um how much I mean I
can't imagine you know the strength and
the sort of the having to go through a
situation like that personally um how
much of the strength going through the
actual reproductive process you know the
joys and the pains of giving birth and
specifically in this case of you know
being able to have access to this
information and knowledge when you do
find out information if it's not the
information you want how much of that
shrink is derived from you personally
versus a community maybe of other people
of other little people talking to other
people about this how how is the
community itself
either helped or hurt in any way well
again I can't speak from personal
experience you know this this again this
technology is bittersweet it really is
and i can say that belonging to a
support group like little people of
America offers a tremendous amount of
support and we all know these statistics
we've been told these statistics since I
knew what my odds were when I was ten
years old and babysitting and knew that
I wanted to have children and I wanted
to be a teacher I did that influence my
selection of mate did I say to myself oh
I better not find it I better not fall
in love with another achondroplastic
because we have a twenty-five percent
chance of having a homozygous absolutely
not do I ache for my boys who will most
likely by mere fact of numbers will wind
up with a condor plastic women and this
will be on the table do I ache for them
before they are even you know really
dating absolutely I ache for them that
this is a reality in their life and so
the support from the community is there
now again if the one thing I've learned
over the years is just because we're all
little does not mean we have the same
politics does not mean we have the same
religious convictions and so I actually
have found myself in a very awkward
position one of the reasons i'm sort of
skirting away from my position on this
is that one too many times i have stated
my position on this to another little
person who is just as educated about
this as i am and they have gotten up off
of the conversation and walked away and
so the support is there but the
naysayers or the conviction the
convicted people are also there so it's
it's it's a very very delicate
discussion
sure when was your first introduction to
this community of other little people
did you find that when you were still
growing up as a kid or is this more of
something you were became became more
active in as an adult I suspect that my
parents came home after being delivered
the diagnosis by braselton who probably
gave them not the website because there
were no websites but the phone number of
the local little people of America which
I will now from here on out call lpa
contact and I suspect that by the time
my parents got home because there were
no cell phones back then they called the
local contact and said when is your next
get-together so I have known nothing
else but lpa I was raised in LP a and
the analogy that I use with new parents
I am often put in touch with because I
have sort of a little bit of a handle in
in the medical community here in the Bay
Area both at Stanford at UCSF and at
Children's Hospital Oakland everybody
has my phone number so I'm often my
husband and I are often put in a
position to be that phone contact or in
this day of age email contact and so the
advice I give those people that
originally you know the first talk is
typically over the phone or on the
computer it's not face to face is I try
to really stress the importance of
joining lpa right then and there because
it's more for the parents at that point
than it is for the kid and the analogy
that I use is you know we've all been on
airplanes where the flight attendant
does for his or her spiel and they say
parents in event of emergency put the
oxygen on yourself first and then assist
your children it's exactly the same
thing in any sort of support group as
far as I'm concerned those parents need
to get to educated they need to get
their head wrapped around this so that
when the kid does go off to school at
five years old and comes home in tears
because they couldn't reach something
because they were teased because they
couldn't reach the cafeteria line
whatever those parents are ready to go
they've been told in advance that the
are the questions the kids going to have
they have contacts of other parents
whose kids are a couple of years older
and it just doesn't it that's just the
way it should be done and oftentimes
I'll be honest we have had very
eye-opening conversations with 40
somethings that were not encouraged by
their families to come to lpa and they
have now found us on their own and here
they come and often with drinking hand
at the dinner time dance there they've
got their head in their hands saying
what did I miss where have I been and
you know who they're mad at that parents
so Jenny uh I just wanted a little bit
more about you why don't you just tell
me where you're from and I want to know
what you do for fun I grew up in a
suburb of Boston called Lincoln
Massachusetts we had we won the train
line I don't remember which line but I
could I was going into boston on my own
when I was 12 years old I don't know if
my parents would have allowed that in
this day of age but so lots and lots of
fun great place to live and then I moved
to Colorado my father was transferred
just as I was starting high school and
that was a little bit unfortunate it was
two weeks before high school started and
we were uprooted it was the best
decision for my father but maybe not for
me so much because you know it's hard
for a little person to break into a new
situation especially right in the middle
of at the beginning of high school but
anyway State College springs for all
four years and then got out of Dodge
Colorado Springs and my politics that do
not align well so decided to come West
to the bay area for college and I've
been here ever since and I believe that
was about 25 years ago as far as hobbies
I kind of try to get into whatever my
teenage and above children are into so
that we can maybe spend some time
together and I'm not and I'm first and
what it is that they're talking about so
that
every ever evolving process and no
matter how hard I try I don't seem to be
up to snuff enough but I I default I
have to know how to sew I do sew
economically these days it doesn't make
sense to sew your clothes it's cheaper
to buy them but by default i have to
alter clothes so i am in front of my
sewing machine at least twice a month
altering a pant length and sleeve length
so what is that I've never thought about
that before but I mean where where do
you shop I mean you are you you have to
shop in different areas or places for
things the most people I'm a good old
size 8 like sixty percent of women out
there and so I'm buying the same stuff
your mom's buying I'm bringing it home
and cutting it off at the knee and
probably tapering it a bit because I
don't want it this wide what did it you
know at the knee would be this wide so
I'm tapering it and I'm altering it same
thing on the sleeves mmm because our
torsos are not affected as you can see
you and I are pretty much sitting at the
same light that's really interesting and
what kinds of hobbies do your kids get
you into besides that they usually
involve technology or soccer so I'm
slowly learning the ropes on social
media soccer I'm just really struggling
with it I sort of complained that
there's a fraternity in my house and I'm
the outsider that's dinner time
conversations always come to soccer and
I kind of disappear and nobody notices
well and sort of in line with a lot of
these everyday items I you know I'm
really curious I'm sure other people are
too what are there any advantages to
having a slightly shorter stature in
general this is a very common question
and I always say to myself I've got to
write it down because I never you know
am fully prepared but in this instance I
did think about it some let's start with
the disadvantages because that's a
shorter list the grocery store is
horrible and I haven't quite figured out
the best time to go
I were not little the best time to go
clearly would be 6 30 or seven in the
morning when I'm awake because it's not
crowded but it's a very bad time for me
to go when it's not crowded because
there aren't people in the aisles to
turn to and say can you hand me that jar
up there so i think the compromise is
more like 10am you know which
unfortunately because i don't work full
time I can do that and I can always
pretty much count on waiting no more
than two or three minutes for somebody
to show up in the aisle I'm not going to
go to customer service every time I need
help you get very savvy at flirting with
people to get what you need so I will
strike up a conversation instantly with
the main motivation being that I need
that can of tomatoes at the top of the
counter other disadvantages it really
depends it's hard to go into communities
that are less educated and less mannered
because we are so comfortable in in our
community which acquainted has gotten to
know us on so many different levels over
the last 20 years my husband died both
our careers myself as a substitute
teacher and he as a an IT guy for small
businesses in our immediate area we're
very well known only because people
don't forget us you know it's not a
comment on our personality however I've
been told that we sort of have known
ominous personalities as well so we get
really comfortable in our environment
and then when we step out to a different
environment and the reaction is totally
inappropriate it's it's it's a slap in
the face it's a reminder can you I mean
if you're comfortable can you give us an
example of a negative reaction that you
actually can have I can give you two and
and and they're a little bit different
one of them was pure ignorance there's
nothing more upsetting to me than to be
in an environment where it's the adults
that are grabbing the children and
saying look at the midget come here come
here Frankie come look at the midget I
cannot believe that in this day
of age that's still happening but when i
go into inner city environments and a
grocery store you know grocery stores
are really harsh places for me to be not
only because of the physical thing but
you're trapped you know you're in a
grocery store line and you can't go
anywhere and you've got kids with their
fingers right five feet away from you
and you're trapped so that is definitely
you know hard the other example of
ignorance was an educated ignorance if I
dare say the five of us were on our
bikes in san francisco by the palace of
fine arts we've been riding our bikes
around and we rode in front of a tour
bus from with tourists from another
country that their cultural norm is to
be curious and to be scientific and they
forget appropriate behavior in that
quest for curiosity and so we can pretty
much assure you that when we go by a
tour bus or a group of tourists from
other countries those video cameras are
trained on us like snipers and my
husband has gotten to the point he's a
very very patient man but he will walk
right up to the camera and say you will
delete that picture he gets very upset
and imagine having 50 of them on your
family you feel like there are snipers
on you what's the difference in your
reaction to how other people respond to
you versus how people may respond to
your children are your feelings about
this trait different for yourself versus
how you see other people react to it
maybe your children or other relatives
or friends I am the biggest mama bear
you will ever meet you mess with my kids
watch out enough sad what uh let's go
back to some of the some of some of the
advantages oh yeah that's a longer list
it really is advantages let's see well
here's a hybrid why don't we do the
hybrid first
the spotlight is always on fair enough
so you can be entertaining and the life
of the party and everyone wants to talk
to you you could get a special spot on
tales from the genome yep but let's say
I've had a bad day but spotlights still
there I actually have a deeper
appreciation for public figures because
by default we have become public figures
I feel I can't imagine being somebody
like Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt with
their children and talk about being
hunted you know and not being able to go
out for a meal without the intrusion so
that's the negative side of that
spotlight well actually in to go on a
quick tangent you made me realize you
know the way little people are portrayed
in the media what what aspect I mean
what are your thoughts on that how are
little people portrayed in your mind
positive negative in between mix and how
to what is your reaction to them our
sydney pointier is Peter Dinklage I am
so proud of him and I want along with
hundreds of other little people mostly
female by the way want to meet him for
better for worse he's not involved with
our group and I can't comment as to why
I would say he's quite busy these days
he is the top build after on one of the
most popular TV shows right now he has
been consistently on the show from I
believe day one they're not killing him
off like they kill off everybody else he
will be king I don't follow the show but
I have enough friends I was thinking
you're crazy why aren't you following
the show he's going to be king and I
thurs i would like to my husband is not
into the blood and gore and sex to the
degree that they are but I
I am keeping my eye on him he is our
sydney pointier and he is up for his
second emmy in two years right now so
he's really been sort of a for you a big
pivotal figure and a good image of being
like everybody else and he's super
popular and it's it's it's almost not
even I don't want to say not noticed as
a trait but it's it's not important in
who he is necessarily as far as it
happens to be part of him and so that
gives visibility to the trait but the
focus on him is not because of his
stature not in this particular that show
he has sold himself to the devil a
couple of times he's tried real hard in
the interviews that I've seen not to I
mean he has been eating out of tuna fish
cans for you know the beginning of his
career while offers of being leprechauns
and Santa's elves and so much were being
thrown at him he really was keeping true
to himself there are a couple of pieces
of work that I would prefer that he had
not done but for the most part he
redeemed himself with station agent for
which he got an Oscar and he come to
find out he's been a lot of little stuff
I'm going home to watch another TV
series that he was in separate seven
episodes on because i'm just so curious
i think it's a shame that he has not
identified with our group because he has
so much to offer up-and-coming people
the students that want to maybe delve
into the film industry well outside of
peter dinklage as far as media portrayal
goes even you know maybe not in the
Hollywood sense just in news or TV what
else have you noticed about portrayal um
in the last decade there's been a lot of
curiosity with little people for a while
and I don't know if I'm allowed to say
this we were nicknaming the TLC network
the little channel because they seemed
heavily interested at one point there
were five or six different series going
on involving little people so now that
we've seemed to have lost our luster a
bit and we were one of them but only for
two episodes only for two
and we we get very defensive what we did
was not reality TV we prefer to call it
documentary TV is what we did for two
episodes so i think the word has finally
gotten out what the correct terminology
is but just in case let me educate you
on that terminology as as you may know
evolves in different groups so in the
african-american community my mother who
was raised in the south in the 30s and
40s was told to call that commit that
population something that I'm not even
comfortable speaking but that's what
they were called and well they were
called Negroes not the other one Negroes
and you know I think when I came around
to school in the 70s we were told no the
word is black and I used the word black
and now when I used the term black I'm
told oh no it's african-american but
then it gets even more confusing because
I have some african-american friends
that say I wasn't born in Africa I'm not
African American I'm black so there's a
lot of confusion around that men not to
mention what the rap stars are doing
with the terminology so the terminology
when when little people of America was
first formed in 1957 the name was
actually midgets of America it was
primarily a venue for Entertainer
entertainers and they kind of made light
of their union for lack of a better word
well then slowly educated serious people
started joining the group and one of the
first tasks at hand was to get rid of
the rid of the word midget now what's
wrong with the word midget for me and
many others it conjures up the image of
vaudeville when they were called midget
performers and they would go around much
like a traveling circus and they would
get on stage and you would see a little
person like myself with a cigar hanging
out of their mouth and a diaper on
and making total fools of themselves so
when I hear the word midget that's what
I conjure up in my mind as do many in
our organization so I think the word is
finally dying occasionally it will be
used in hockey leagues it's still used
up in Canada and signifying the younger
kids I think and and I I think the
little people group up there has been
really working on that so the
terminology that I'm comfortable with
long-winded answer is I'm comfortable
with little person and I'm comfortable
with dwarf because that's what I was
raised with now that's not to say that
my children and they're okay with that
too but maybe my grandchildren will have
come up with a new truck right actually
and and I probably won't include what
I'm about to say but just you made me
think of it it's just so amazing to make
the connection that you know I think in
the as far as sexuality is concerned in
the gay community I mean the evolution
of those of the nomenclature of the name
and what people are comfortable with and
it in one way I'm fascinated with
because it's a group identifier and I
honestly think people should you know we
should respect groups enough to call
them what they want to be called you
know and I think in the gay community
you know there are people who live and
die by the word queer you know that's
what they want to be called they
reclaimed are there other people who
identify as gay there are other people
who identify you know you know and it's
several different ways and the community
argues about it all the time you know
well internally you know like no we
shouldn't use this word or we shouldn't
use that word and and then that can even
be confusing for people on the outside
looking in because then they're like
well yeah what do we do so it's amazing
the parallels there between that's that
look that I want you to yeah I'm
definitely gonna check that out so I
have an adorable story to tell of my 15
year old who I need to remind myself is
indeed a really great kid because
sometimes I I forget that he was a coach
this summer for a summer sports camp
he's very very athletically minded and
unfortunately due to being four feet
tall is not athletically bodied now
put him amongst other little people and
he's going to bring home the gold medals
but when the population is one in 20,000
that's just not going to happen on a
daily weekly it happens on an annual
basis so next week we're going to the
World Games for little people and I
suspect that my 15 year old will be
setting records in all of the different
events that he's going to be doing so he
with my urging took this job over the
summer where he was a coach and training
with a third-party sports camp and every
day I would say okay you got to give me
one story you know based on the day tell
me one little thing that happened in one
of these days he came home he says well
something interesting happened today so
I stopped everything I was doing so I
could listen but you can't ask too many
questions because then he closes up
again he says somebody asked what time
it was and I pulled out my cell phone
and the kid said what you have a cell
phone that's not fair you're only eight
and Ben said no I'm about to be 16 and
the kid said oh that's why you're a
midget and Ben said well actually Sammy
I'm I'm not a midget Mitch it's a really
mean word I would rather you call me a
dwarf or a little person but you know
what Sammy you met me two days ago so
you should be calling me Ben and I said
Ben was there an audience for that
discussion he said nope it was just me
and Sammy and I said then something
tells me that when they all went home
Sammy got into the car and told his
mother about the whole conversation I've
been a mother for the next day Sammy
brought been a card that was handwritten
inclusive about how great it was to have
been as his coach and that he would
never use the M word ever
what is what is driving a car like I
mean do you I mean do you have any like
do you have to what is the sleep in car
like why no but I'm asking like foot
pedals though like is that I have um we
have extension pedals okay that bolt on
to the gap that you use their steel bars
with you know C clamps and all that
hardware that I don't know what it's
called takes about 45 minutes to put
them on not much fun it takes about 10
minutes to take them off so I could
drive your car if I had brought my extra
set of extension pedals and I was
totally limber and could fold myself up
into a small little ball and be upside
down with my hex wrenches and all that
sort of stuff and if you wanted to drive
my car no problem you would just have to
take them off and I would ask you very
nicely to put them back on when you were
done so um what I was going down to Los
Angeles to interview during college with
you know the film industry I rented a
car in burbank and I put them on myself
in my business suit and proceeded to get
on the five in burbank and about 300
yards between ahead of the intersection
of the five and the 10 my gas pedal
falls off and i have nowhere to go
except for the shoulder that really
wasn't a shoulder and i had to drift
because there was no gas so there was
not enough room on the shoulder to open
the driver's door for somebody to come
help me so eventually a latino guy pulls
over and between his limited English my
limited spanish he offered to help but
he had to get into this rental car and
drive it with me in it and drive it off
of this freeway in order to do it so I
was saying a few prayers at that point
and everything was fine he fixed it and
he followed me he asked if he could
follow me to where I was going to make
sure I got there that was the last time
I ever put extension pedals on a rental
soon after that the I don't know if it
was Reagan or bush but one of them did
something very nice called the Americans
with Disabilities Act and that means now
that as long as I give my rental car
company 24 hours notice they have to
have a car waiting for me with hand
controls so I just did it today as a
matter of fact for my trip next week and
doesn't cost me any extra I get to walk
right off that airplane into my rental
car just like you do I had to get
comfortable with driving with hand
controls and it's hard legal or not I
used to still maybe do use my cell phone
a little bit when I'm driving and you
can't do that with hand controls because
one hand is always on the steering wheel
and the other hand is on the mechanism
that acts as your gas and brake I want
you to if you can list for me if you can
quickly some advantages other advantages
we sorta we keep getting so hot light
what's the hybrid okay so let's work up
from the spotlight thing people remember
me that's kind of the spotlight to but
if I want to jog somebody's memory over
the phone and I'll say hey this is Ginny
Foose your little customer oh yes how
are you so I get the information quicker
yeah um when I get tickets to a show I'm
kind of stretching it a little bit
because I just identified the fact that
you and I are sitting about the same
height but if somebody like really tall
sits in front of me I can't enjoy the
show if people stand up like they do in
a concert forget it I can't see anything
so I explain this now what's interesting
is is that ticketmaster when they see a
a disabled seating they're really
thinking about wheelchairs because it's
all about numbers I mean the same thing
with the Americans with Disability Act
the the architectural standards that
were sad were for people in wheelchairs
so if i would have stand up
right now next to you you and I would be
about the same height but you've got
long arms that I don't so ATM slides gas
station slides you know all of that is
meant for you in the wheelchair they're
like three inches too tall for me it's
beginning to change a bit I'm having an
easier time with the brand new gas pumps
I think there's been enough yelling and
screaming from the dwarf population and
and we become more of an advocacy group
our current president is awesome and
totally into advocacy so maybe his
efforts are paying off but so so long
story short I tend to ramble the tickets
i can say i need the tickets and i get
good tickets so that's an advantage um
we went camping recently and i was able
to stand up in my tent and change my
clothes whereas the average highs
friends could not uh definitely counter
that problem yeah what about airplanes
oh yes airplane travel is I would argue
more comfortable for me but the
difference is is that my feet are
dangling look at right now and yours are
not so mine are going to maybe go to
sleep but when I've gone on a long
flight if there happens to be an empty
seat next to mine I can actually lay
down the flight attendants don't like it
much but I can if I would do the exact
same thing um okay let's I want a pivot
nest too we're going to try to wrap up
here in last two different question I'm
nice two different kinds of questions
the first I'm going to go with is
knowing everything you know now as
yourself and with the current
technologies even may be thinking about
the possible advances in technologies
that will have in the future
in your lifetime or even possibly you
know beyond that would you change would
you choose to be different and sort of
as a variation of that you know if you
could choose this for your children how
would you I think like my first answer
is we call it the magic pill you know if
you had been able to take a magic pill
to not be a dwarf and I think my
response to that magic pill would have
been different depending on what decade
of my life you were asking about I would
most likely have taken that magic pill
in middle school and probably high
school prior to that I don't think I
really cared I was just a kid I've never
faced outright discrimination in my job
at Hunt's so I think that magic pill may
have been taken between middle and high
school but after that you kind of get
awfully comfortable in your skin so I
often ask the question when I'm teaching
and by the way every time I go into a
new classroom as a substitute teacher I
almost have to address this what's funny
is when I'm if I'm teaching a primary
grade up to like second grade the
conversation lasts about two minutes and
then they all want to tell me about
their dog or something if I go into high
school it they can milk it for good 45
minutes and then I get into a little bit
of trouble because I don't do what I'm
there to do and I'm not quite sure if
they're milking it because they would
prefer to talk about this and try to you
know pull the wool over my eyes and not
do the work that the teacher has left
for them or if they're genuinely
interested I'd like to believe it's a
combination of those two things but the
question I posed to them is do you think
it's harder to be born disabled or to
become disabled later on in your life
and the people that are really on it and
thinking I've actually it blows my mind
when they give me the answer that I'm
looking for which is this
most definitely it's harder to become
disabled because something has been
taken away from you with the exception
perhaps of being blind or deaf because
if you become blind later in life you
you know what things look like so you
can reference that when you can no
longer see them when if you become deaf
later in life you've learned how to talk
you can talk and I just I just want to
kiss them when they give me that answer
because they truly are thinking about it
and so when I think about our soldiers
that come home disabled I really feel
for them especially soldiers who were
big strong buff guys that girls and they
no longer are and that and I feel for
them and I'm so proud of them when they
turn that around and they become the
wounded warriors or the wheelchair rugby
team or something that they're putting
that energy in the channeling it into a
different realm a positive realm so
what's in with with one question on them
you know for for someone it sounds like
you know being a little person can have
its challenges probably like most traits
regardless of what the specific trade is
going through middle school can always
be rough and everybody's at different
stages in their life when if you could
give a message to you know young people
in particular but anybody who feels
different specifically it could be
something so obvious like something like
stature could be something hidden you
know what what do you say to people who
have their own struggles and
particularly with your perspective how
how would you tell them to to what's the
best way to handle their struggle this
is probably trademarked but it does get
better it's a catchy phrase but it's so
true so in general if you can just get
through middle school and find some
friends in high school you live in a
progressive area like the Bay Area
because I think that if you if you live
in a sheltered less educated
conservative area you're going to meet
more obstacles great um I think that
does it for us right now thank you so
much thank you I appreciate it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
