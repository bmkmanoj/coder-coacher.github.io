there are many packing tools we call
Packers available that is there are many
many ways to obfuscate malware code
furthermore there are hundreds of
thousands of malware samples released to
the internet every day by attackers and
like I said most of them are packed this
means that we cannot manually analyze
all the malware samples instead we need
automatic approach to unpack malware and
analyze malware and such approach has to
be universally applicable to all the
malware samples an approach that we can
take is to combine static and dynamic
analysis to do fine grain analysis in
particular with static analysis we look
at the packed malware code and we get a
set of instructions in the packed
programme and then we run the malware
and with dynamic analysis we can
identify instructions that are not in
the statically identified set of
instructions meaning that these are new
instructions that we did not see in a
packed programme this must be
instructions that have been unpacked
just before execution in other words by
identifying instructions that we can
only see in runtime we have identified
part of the program that had been packed
once we identified the unpacked code we
can then apply other anti-malware
techniques including signature scanning
to identify the malware logic for
example even though after packing each
malgor instance looks different the
malware called meaning the original
instructions once unpacked remain the
same therefore after unpacking we can
still use a signature to identify the
malware for example the instructions
that have been packed can be the logic
that the malware uses to do keylogging
and a signature based approach can
identify this part of the malware</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
