equations and even though they look
really different we mentioned that they
are equivalent to one another we also
saw that this equation over here on the
right written in this particular form
became very useful when we looked at the
quadratic equations that go along with
these equations for parabolas these two
equations are also equivalent but the
equation 0 equals negative 1/8 times the
quantity X minus 4 times the quantity X
minus 28 is very useful to us
because from it we can just read off the
locations of the x-intercepts we have
one at x equals four and we have another
at x equals 28 now we were just looking
at this equation to help us deal with
the expanding dimensions of grants
growing floor space we had 0 equals x
squared + 25 X minus 150 what kind of
equation is this though is this a linear
equation or is it an equation for a
parabola or is it a quadratic equation</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
