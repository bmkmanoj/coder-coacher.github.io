you're wondering what to do next there's
a few things I'd recommend checking out
all the links are in the instructor
notes below if you haven't already check
out the offline web application course
it's not just about offline but dives
deeper into service workers the
mechanics of casting and indexdb even
though we use promises in this course we
didn't cover them at all so if you've
never seen them before or if you're
still trying to wrap your head around
them check out the JavaScript promises
course we're working on a course for
push notifications right now but in the
meantime we've got a code lab that you
can use to add push notifications to
your weather app there's also the web
tooling and automation course which will
help you level up your skills I learned
a few good things by taking that course
i'm sure i'm missing something so take a
look at the instructor notes for any
updates or anything new and in the words
of one of my heroes it's over go home go
why are you still here thanks for
sticking with me kind of quiet and
lonely in here they wouldn't let me have
the little clapper thing I wanted that
it was fun there was a picture on the
back that was always fun to look at</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
