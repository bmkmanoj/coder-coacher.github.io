what awesome flashy displays some of the
other vendors have he's just got his
little glasses wipers and his little
sign investing in some advertising seems
like a really great idea for his
business fortunately grant runs into a
woman who works for an ad agency and she
guarantees with her agency's help grant
can make five thousand dollars in just
two weeks of course there is a price to
pay it would cost grant two thousand
dollars to work with them if we assume
that grant earns money at a constant
rate or in other words that the graph of
profit versus time is a linear graph in
a linear equation how long will it take
grant to break even that's what you want
to figure out let's say that X is equal
to the number of days since the ads were
released and let's say that Y is equal
to grants profit in dollars thinking
about the information the problem gave
us what two points we know lie on our
line note also that making $5,000 means
making a profit of five thousand dollars</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
