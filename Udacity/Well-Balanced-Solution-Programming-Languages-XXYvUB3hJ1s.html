this is a lot like 5-3 if Palace and
walk are identifiers so here the
parentheses are balanced we like this
utterance here we start a bold tag and
right nagib but we never close off the
bold tag this is not balanced here we
start an italics tag and right mahfouz
and then we close off the italics tag
this is well balanced here we write open
pulitzer plus open prize close close
open parenthesis open parenthesis close
close this one matches there this one
matches there these are well balanced
you might think there's no reason to put
prize in parenthesis and you might not
if you were writing but the grammar the
language allows it as long as the
parentheses are balanced over here this
one's particularly tricky we have a
closed parenthesis followed by 1956
followed by an open parenthesis now the
number of open and closed parenthesis is
the same so you might think it's
balanced but they're in the wrong order
we need to do the opening before the
closing so this does not match nagib
mahfouz is a relatively famous egyptian
writer he wrote palace walk it's set in
about nineteen seventeen around the end
of world war one in egypt ER in cairo
and it details what goes on with
al-sayyid Ahmad al-jawad and his family
and my best attempt at dueling Egypt or
Cairo is someone next to a pyramid you
can tell it's a pyramid because it's
clearly labeled</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
