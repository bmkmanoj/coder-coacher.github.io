perform the same steps f could be less
than positive 5 or f can be greater than
negative 5 remember for the negative
answer we reverse the inequality sign
and here's what's interesting the
greater than symbol creates a union are
two separate regions where the less than
sign creates an intersection between two
points with just the flip of a sign we
can exclude entire numbers or include a
small region and let's look more closely
right here at these two we said we get
an intersection so that means F is
between these two numbers let's rewrite
these inequalities now that I've
switched the spot of these two
inequalities I'm going to reverse the
direction of this inequality I've
switched this inequality around so
negative 5 is less than F this is still
the same as f being greater than
negative 5 notice that f's are in the
middle now the apps are between my two
numbers we can even write this as one
inequality and in fact when you solve
any absolute value inequalities with a
less than symbol you can write it as 1
inequality with three parts pretty
impressive</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
