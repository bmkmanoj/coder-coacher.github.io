about solving big hairy computational
problems as efficiently as possible and
here at Georgia Tech there are many
examples of scientists every day using
supercomputers to do all kinds of
important stuff stuff like simulating
the dynamics of the earth or studying
biomolecular systems or analyzing social
networks or understanding the cosmos
just to name a few
now these are incredibly complex
phenomena and many scientists believe
that we won't gain new insights into
them without some combination of new
mathematical models leaner algorithms
and data structures more and accurate
data as well as enough processing power
now ours is a CS course on
supercomputing so the main question
we'll be interested in is given a
computational problem and a machine how
do you compute at the absolute limits of
scale and speed you'll encounter many
such limits throughout the course but
one of the more interesting ones come
from physics these are things like
limits based on the speed of light or
the amount of energy power or heat
dissipated by a system in fact that's
the reason we're here in this crazy mad
scientist lab run by my crazy mad
scientist friend and colleague Ken Brown
Ken Brown and his crew are thinking
about how to build quantum computing
systems that represents one of the
ultimate limits of physical computation
now we won't actually talk about quantum
computing stuff in this class but I
wanted to start there to sort of
stimulate your imagination not only
about the limits of conventional
computing systems but also about what
might lie beyond</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
