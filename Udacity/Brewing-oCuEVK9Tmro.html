three brewing is complete we started it
up it's it's going and maybe the user
pulled the pot or stuck it back in or
whatever but we eventually got to the
end and brewing is complete so in this
case what what what steps do you expect
to have happened so at this point we
could assume that there should be coffee
in the pot and if there's coffee in the
pot then we had that warmer plate that
needs to be activated to keep the coffee
warm but I guess there's also the switch
situation like you mentioned the cop the
pot could have been removed and then
it's replaced so we got to do the check
to see if I guess there's still coffee
there in the pot after brewing is
complete but the boiler needs to be
turned off we're no longer boiling the
water source is not really relevant
anymore either I guess we need to
somehow maybe prohibit or well I guess
you could start brewing again but I
don't think that's an issue I think I
junk that being an issue but I don't
think it is and then we need to turn on
the light to say hey there's coffee
ready so we got that light there so we
need to inform the user interface it's
where the light light lives so the one
other thing that needs to go on is the
containment vessel needs to be informed
because it keeps track of how much
coffee remains in the pot and at the
very start the pot is full and so it has
to be told that the pot is full so
there's a lot of messages and checks
that have to go on here let's let's add
those into the diagram as well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
