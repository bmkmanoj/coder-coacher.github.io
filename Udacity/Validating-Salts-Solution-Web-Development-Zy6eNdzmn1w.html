make password hash a little bit to take
an assault parameter because we don't
want to make a new salt every time we
only want to make a new salt when we're
making a new password hash but if we
want to verify our password hash we want
to pass and salt as a default parameter
or pass in salt as a parameter so what I
do is I pull salt out of the H by
splitting on the comma and taking the
the second part which is the salt and
then I pass that into my function now
you could have also implemented this by
just copying this line into valid pw
which i guess this should have said may
need but it's always better if you can
reuse a function like this so you don't
have to you know if you want to change
the logic here you don't have to change
everything here let's go ahead and give
this a run you can see it says true and
if we add an extra print statement here
print H and now we give this a run we
should see our what would store in the
database here we go there's a hash
there's a salt and we can see that it
matched and if we were to run this again
we'd see that we get a different hash in
salt but it still matches so pretty cool
huh let's discuss one more thing about
password hashing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
