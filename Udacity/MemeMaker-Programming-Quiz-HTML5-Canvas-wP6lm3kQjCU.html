drawing text let's combine it all and
make a simple meme generator we've given
you a head start with some basic HTML
inside this HTML you'll find a few
things but let me point out what's
important here in this section of HTML
we're creating the top line and bottom
line entries which you can see right
here this is where a user will be able
to type in text that they want to appear
on the image inside the script tag we'll
find all the necessary components to
start building the meme generator we can
see here in this if statement we're
getting the text that was made in the
top and bottom lines and then we have
this function called redraw meme where
we get the canvas and select the context
like we did before after that we can see
a place where your code goes then we've
got this save file function which is
going to let us use the to data URL
method to hopefully save our images then
we've got this handle file select method
which will help us load a file from the
disk as an image for the background but
the most important thing is that your
code goes within this redraw meme
function so put together everything that
you've learned so far use the background
image and put some text over it to
create this meme generator so now that
you've got the starter code for a simple
meme maker can you use the canvas to
load images with that iconic meme text
when you're done check this box to
