the more standard method is actually
just like light striping so you
recognize this figure this was the light
stripes where we protect out the stripes
look at them from a camera and then we
see that the stripes been depending upon
the depth of the object so as we said
before you're still just doing stereo
okay except instead of two cameras
you're actually doing projection of one
and coming out the other but the thing
that I want to remind you about stereo
is if you know the relative geometry of
the cameras you know how they're they're
aligned and they're they're offsets etc
right there extrinsic sand their
intrinsic right then for any given
location in one image there is an epi
polar line remember in the other image
along which to look now this is also
true for the projection method right so
if I project a point out right at some
location in one image then depending
upon the depth of the scene in my other
image yes I'm over here magnet in the
other image where that will point will
be will be along an epi polar line and
how far along the line it is is a
function of the depth so I only have to
search in along a line if I know the
calibration well in my connect system of
course i know the calibration between
the projector and the camera but instead
of projecting lines what we're gonna do
is we're going to project out a speckle
pattern so instead of a regular
projector we're using a connect instead
of line stripes we're spraying out a
pattern of they call them pseudo-random
speckles because it's important that the
pattern be a little different everywhere
so that I can do a ready normalized
correlation all right it's instead of
using a camera i use my connect because
the connect actually if you take a look
at it has a little projector in it and a
camera and the relationship between
those are known and then what the camera
sees is a speckle pattern but where the
dots are offset as a function of the
depth so that's shown here so here's a
picture so it's looking flat this is
from one perspective it's actually sort
of faked and how it's doing it but don't
worry about it if it was just a flat
wall but if I change the depth so I put
a little book on the stand right you see
that's the difference between the depth
right so on the left one I'm
projecting it on a flat wall and looking
at it and on the right that's the offset
that comes from the book right and by
the way what is this little pattern this
little thing here that's a shadow right
because the thing is offset a little bit
and I'm projecting here there's a little
area right here that I can see with the
camera that can't be seen by the
projector that's what the black pattern
is in this particular case the
projection is coming from this side and
the camera is coming from that side all
right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
