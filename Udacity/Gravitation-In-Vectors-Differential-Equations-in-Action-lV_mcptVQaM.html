gravitation do this in 2d which means we
need to have vectors let's place the
earth at the origin the moon sits at a
vector X M the spacecraft sits at a
vector X s and we need the distance of
the spacecraft from the moon let's call
that D M s and we need the distance of
the spacecraft from the earth that's
called that de yi s now we can put now
we can put both of Newton's laws
together the mass of the spacecraft
times its acceleration as a vector now
equals the force that is exerted on the
spacecraft and this force stems from
gravity it has two components one is the
force that is exerted by the earth the
other is the force exerted by the moon
so the force exerted by the earth would
be gravitational constant times the mass
of the Earth times the mass of the
spacecraft divided by the distance
between them squared times a unit vector
that is vector of length one pointing to
earth something like this and for the
moon we get the gravitational constant
times the mass of the moon times the
mass of the spacecraft divided by the
distance between them squared times a
unit vector pointing to the moon so how
do we get these two vectors for the
first one we can take minus XS that's a
vector that takes us from the spacecraft
to earth and divide by the length of X s
which is nothing but des for the second
one we can take the difference vector X
moon minus X spacecraft that's a vector
that has its tail at the spacecraft and
its tip at the moon and we divide by the
length of that vector which is the
distance from the moon to the spacecraft
now let's forget about the force then we
see that the mass of the spacecraft
cancer's what we need to know are the
mass of the earth and the mass of the
moon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
