for our ad we need to add our keywords
these are the foundation of your ad
group your ad has a possibility of
appearing in the top search results when
people search these keywords google
recommends starting with 10 to 20
keywords that are specific to phrases
that your potential customers may use
when searching for your product or
service google also recommends avoiding
one word keywords which if you think
about it makes sense imagine if we use a
keyword dog think of everything that can
be related to that dog health info blogs
about dogs news articles relating to
dogs videos of dogs things on Animal
Planet buying a dog cute dog pictures
hot dogs being sick as a dog getting a
little hair of the dog dog whistles dog
parks types of dogs I could go on but I
think you get the picture none of these

avoid that chaos you can use Google

keywords you want to use so let's add in
