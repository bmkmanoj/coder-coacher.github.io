to introduce in this unit is how to loop
through a list since loops are
collections of things it's very useful
to be able to go through a list and do
something with every element of the list
so with the things we know so far we
already know enough to do this if we put
them together in the right way
you should remember the while loop from
the previous unit and as a reminder this
is the way the while loop works we have
a while followed by a test expression
which is something that evaluates to
true or false and when it evaluates to a
true value that means to execute the
block which can be a block of any number
of statements we want and then at the
end of the block we continue go back to
the while loop try the test again and we
keep executing the block as long as the
test evaluates to true so for this quiz
we're going to see if you can figure out
how to use while to go through the
elements of a list we're going to
provide most of the code for you our
goal is to define a procedure called
print all elements that takes as input a
list will use the name P for the list
and our goal is for that procedure to
print out every element in the list and
I've written most of the code for this
for you but I've left out the test
expression for the while so the code
that's written introduce a variable
named I initializes this value to 0 and
we're going to use I to index through
the elements of the list for each
element we print out that value and then
we increase I plus 1 so can you figure
out the test expression we need for the
while to make print all elements work
and what print all elements should do is
print out every element in the input
list P</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
