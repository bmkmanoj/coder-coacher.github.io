memory may have been explained to you if
the picture that looks something like
this we have the CPU where your
instructions get executed and these
instructions may read or write to either
main memory or 2-disc main memory is
fast and you can access any element in
the same amount of time that's what we
mean by random access and it is
temporary in the sense that when the
program exits or if power is lost all
the information stored in it disappears
the hard disk by contrast is slow it
uses sequential access since you have to
actually spin the discs to the right
place and what you write to the disk is
permanent it will still be there when
the program exits or if power is lost in
this lecture we're going to refine this
picture in two ways first we'll look at
cash systems which allow the CPU to
access the same information that is in
main memory only faster understanding
how cash systems work will help you
optimize your code when you need to
second we will explain the virtual
memory system as you write your
application and a compiler compiles it
to generate addresses for all your
variables in your code you don't have to
worry about other programs and what
memory addresses they might be using in
fact there's often an illusion of having
even more main memory than exists in the
system and that your application has
them all to itself we'll see how the
operating system maintains this
abstraction through the virtual memory
system the details are essential to
understanding operating system
optimizations and how the need to share
resources effects program performance</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
