those acorns and family photos that you
provided us and we added them as images
into the app here take a look the whole
this is so cool look at these family
member icons this one looks just like my
grandmother and the colors and the
acorns this is starting to really feel
great yeah everything's coming together
really well
but I think there's one more feature we
can add what's that well the ability to
hear the correct pronunciation of each
word Oh pronunciation is really
important in learning a language it's
been the hardest thing for me that's
true and in order to do that we need an
audio file each word being spoken Andrea
could you record some audio files for us
sure I don't have to brush up on my
pronunciation oh don't worry you're
gonna do great let's go into the
recording studio to make those sound
clips then so while they're doing that
let's get back to the course map all
right so right now when less than four
out of our four lesson course we're in
the homestretch now now in this lesson
we're going to first allow the user to
play an audio file to hear the
pronunciation of each word when they
touch it next we're going to learn about
Androids activity life cycle and also
learn how to properly clean up resources
in the write callbacks now here's a
diagram of the activity lifecycle that
we'll be discussing more in detail later
now onward</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
