to write answers one way that you can
move toward having X by itself would be
to multiply each side by negative one
the coefficient here in front of X is
negative one so if we multiply by
negative 1 we get negative 1 times
negative 1 which is just equal to
positive 1 and that would leave us with
x equals 6 however there's one other way
you could do this you could also have
said that you would divide each side by
negative 1 i'm just writing in here what
you would type if this had been your
answer the reason this works is that the
coefficient here as you said is negative
1 so you take negative 1 and divide by
negative 1 or just dividing a number by
itself and we get positive 1 so once
again that would leave us with just X by
itself and a positive 6 on the other
side so both methods work</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
