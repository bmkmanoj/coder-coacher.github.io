great series of hypotheses what's
interesting is the word hypotheses I
call that a $50 word that really sounds
pretty important and I use it when I
teach this class in universities but you
know what the word hypotheses is really
a fancy word for guesses and if you
really think about it when you fill out
the business model canvas
all you have is a series of guesses
that's it
that's all we have is a series of
guesses what's great about the business
model canvas is it allowed us to
organize our thinking not around
functional organizations like what sales
doing or what's marketing doing or
what's our spreadsheets say but this
around a series of thoughtful first
guesses about who do we think our
customers are and and what products are
we making for them and how much are we
going to charge and that's great and you
could sit around all day or all week in
your conference room figuring out what
those are but the odds are you're
probably wrong but it's a great first
starting point but the question is how
do we change those guesses into facts</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
