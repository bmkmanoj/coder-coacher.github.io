of the sentences and background
knowledge is very intricate and complex
and very interesting as well sometimes
the structure of sentences that we use
to tell stories have only implied
actions in them consider the senses John
fertilize the field now it's hard to see
fertilize mapping into any of the
primitive actions that we had here there
is an implied action here that is not
specified in the structure this sentence
here but there is much more meaningful
in terms of the background knowledge
that we have of those primitive actions
well John fertilize they feel really
means is they don't put the fertilizer
on the field now put is something that
maps into primitive actions were easily
so this points to another feature of the
processing initially the area agent will
start with the work given in this
sentence and try to map in the primitive
actions and if that fails then the air
agent will start thinking in terms of
how to transform the sentences to bring
out implied actions that can more easily
map into the primitive actions this
again is common sense reasoning through
common sense reasoning I'm interpreting
that they must be employed action here
that captures the meaning of the
sentence once I have made the implied
action here transparent then the rest of
the processing easier they put action
maps into the primitive action of move
object this frame is pulled out and the
rest of these slots can be filled in
like earlier</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
