it's the X chromosome and it's likely to
be recessive now how do we come up with
that well we're pretty sure that it
can't be the Y chromosome think about it
take this father as an example this
father up here is affected that means
he'd have a y-chromosome with the
affected allele he had two daughters did
he give his Y chromosome to a daughter
no there's no way right because their
daughters daughters are by definition XX
so if this daughter is XX she didn't get
any affected y from the father so how
did she pass on the trait to her son
right that just doesn't make sense it
must be the X here the X is affected and
the father passes out X onto this
daughter but because this daughter has
another X from the mother that's
unaffected you don't see the trait she's
just the carrier but when she has a son
the son is XY The Sun has to get the X
from the mother she gave him the
recessive allele X and we also suspected
this trait this allele causing this
trait is recessive because as we
mentioned before on our autosomal
inheritance pattern pedigrees recessive
traits tend to skip generations and
unaffected parents have affected
offspring where's dominant traits show
up in every generation or almost every
generation and many times affected
parents have affected offspring and
that's not the case for this pedigree</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
