unit that we can draw matrix like this
we're here in the columns we have what a
deterministic Ram can do and here we
have what a non-deterministic Ram can do
and in the rows we have polynomial time
and exponential time so you already know
to complexity classes that go into here
one is P and the other one is NP and
there's actually also names for these
classes up here this one is commonly
referred to as exp or x time you can
guess what that stands for and this one
over here guess what is called next time
now since we're this far in the unit
here's a little challenging quiz for you
because you can actually arrange all of
these complexity classes here in a sort
of hierarchy meaning that for example
all problems that fall into this
complexity class here automatically also
fall into this complexity class here and
this complexity class here so it's
basically a hierarchy or containment of
the complexity classes I'm going to give
all of the complexity classes over here
a number one two three four and what I
would like you to do is to enter the
number of the respective complexity
class so that you have built this
hierarchy over here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
