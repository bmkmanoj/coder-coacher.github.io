to be a little bit different from the
previous lessons and that is going to be
me and a couple other engineers sharing
with you our real-world experiences so
we'll start with how reddit is
architected today so when I started
reddit I knew not much more than you
know right now and over the years we've
had to scale reddit to quite a big size
and we're I'm going to talk with Neil
Williams who's the current lead engineer
at reddit and we're going to discuss
reddit's architecture and how it serves
billions of pages per month it's quite a
bit different from the sort of stuff
we've been working on so far on this
class but you'll see how we got there
and then I've spent some time talking
with Chris you who's one of the Udacity
engineers and Udacity actually uses App
Engine to serve their entire website
just like you Iowa's new to Udacity a
few months ago and I've basically
learned as I've gone through this course
and I've actually really learned to love
it and so has Chris at Udacity and so
we're going to discuss some of the
real-world problems they've had the face
that we haven't yet had to encounter now
nothing in this lesson is required for
your final exam so it's just sit back
and learn and we'll have a good time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
