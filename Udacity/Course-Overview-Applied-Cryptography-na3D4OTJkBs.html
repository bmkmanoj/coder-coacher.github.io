this class the first two units will
focus on symmetric cryptography and it's
applications symmetric cryptography
means both parties have the same key so
if you have two people Alice and Bob and
in cryptography we almost always talk
about Alice and Bob it's not clear why
but they're useful people to talk about
and they apparently have lots of secret
messages to send between each other and
they want to send messages they want to
know that they couldn't be intercepted
by some eavesdropper listening on the
channel in symmetric cryptography we
assume that they both start knowing the
same key and they can use that same key
for both encryption and decryption we'll
see more that what that means soon in
this unit what we'll do in units 3 &amp;amp; 4
is introduce asymmetric cryptography as
well as some applications and asymmetric
cryptography is also known as public key
cryptography and the key difference
between symmetric and asymmetric
cryptography is that the keys used to
encrypt and decrypt can be different so
our message gets encrypted it means
there's some function that takes a
message and a key produces some
encrypted message which we call
ciphertext in symmetric cryptography the
decryption uses the same key in
asymmetric cryptography the decryption
uses a different key and if the keys are
different and unrelated that means you
can reveal one of the keys without
revealing the other key and that's the
power that asymmetric encryption gives
us and we'll see lots of interesting
ways to use that and the unit's 5 &amp;amp; 6
will look at protocols that use both
symmetric and asymmetric cryptography to
solve interesting problems the reason
most interesting protocols combine both
of these is because asymmetric
cryptography tends to be very expensive
you need big keys you need lots of
mathematics to do asymmetric or
photography lots of computation where a
symmetric cryptography can be very
efficient so that's why most interesting
protocols like the one we saw for
accessing a secure website involve both
symmetric and asymmetric cryptography</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
