if we can write it as something like y
equals MX plus B where m is the slope
which can be neatly we already have for
our equation and B is the y coordinate
of the y-intercept since we have slots
for x and y in our equations and we
conveniently already have two points
that we know can belong in those two
spots we can use either of these points
and plug it into the slots for x and y
so you can start off with what we
already know using the slope I'm going
to use this point 100 1200 and plug 100
in for X and 1200 in for y that's
because we know that this point or the
coordinates this point when substituted
into the proper places in this equation
satisfy this equation or make it a true
statement that means we're allowed to
use them I still don't know what the y
coordinate of our y-intercept is so I
would really like to figure that out
with the equation so I want to get be by
itself on one side of the equation and i
end up with 700 equals B and we can take
this value and put it back in the
equation we started with that gives us a
final equation of y equals 5x plus 700
so this is our answer you could of
course have used the point 61,000
instead of 100 1200 and we can check to
see that this is right by plugging in
each of the coordinates for the two
points to it and seeing if each side
ends up equaling the other side</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
