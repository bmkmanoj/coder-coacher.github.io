restful architecture for our development
needs what about the structure of our
data xml and json are two very viable
options so let's compare them
side-by-side as well
xml was developed in 1997 it uses
identifying tags similar to HTML and
provides a rigid way of structuring data
json was developed in 2001 and is
derived from the javascript language
similar to HTML
it is easily human readable but can be
condensed with less characters to be
very lightweight once again it seems
like these specs aren't really helping
and making a decision if one is better
than the other but since our api vests
are made to best suit the developer we
should use a data structure that is most
friendly to our end user looking at this
chart we can see that xml started as the
data structure of choice but json has
been quickly gaining ground year over
year and is now the more popular data
structure amongst new api s by
piggybacking off the popularity of
javascript json has been readily
accepted by the web development
community as the most common way to
structure data sent across restful api s
so for this course it's json for the win</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
