textures can vastly improve the look of
a model GPUs are very much optimized to
access textures having considerable
numbers of transistors dedicated to just
this task this in turn has led to a huge
number of uses for textures the idea of
applying two or more textures has any
number of other uses for example a
surface can be made visually rich by
giving it textures that add scratches
decals planetary cloud cover or any
number of other phenomena multiple
textures can be combined by addition
multiplication or other operations and
all affect the same attribute mirror
reflection can be done by rendering from
a different angle and then using the
reflected image as a texture used at
each pixel this is a whole huge
subcategory where a scene is rendered
and then it's resulting images post
processed in various ways we'll talk a
bit more about these when we get into
shader programming because 3gs is a web
component it can interact in interesting
ways with other data for example you can
take a video and use it as a texture
this texture can then be placed on
multiple moving screens as shown in this
demo now that you know the basics of
texture mapping you're equipped to go
ahead and dig into other people's demos
and see what makes them tick better yet
you can now try out some of your own
effects texturing is a powerful tool and
I look forward to seeing what you do
with it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
