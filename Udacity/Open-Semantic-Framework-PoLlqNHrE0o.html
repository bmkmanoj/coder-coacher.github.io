what's called its open semantic
framework acne has a simple vocabulary a
simple syntax and also very simple
semantics but there obviously could be
lots of information you'd like to encode
in an architectural description and
encoding all that complexity you would
like to also have some way of checking
it for whether it's valid acne itself
and the acne tools don't provide that
checking but they do provide a way for
you to essentially export your
description in such a way that it can
used be used by external checking tools
that's what the open semantic framework
is in particular the description that
you've either drawn using acne studio or
you've typed in using the graph using
the editor can be used to generate a
description in first order logic that
description can then be used by an
external tool which takes as input the
first order logic and proofs whatever it
needs to do such that for example that
the particular architecture you've
described obeys certain rules there's an
example here for the client-server
situation and it's essentially a an
English language keyword version of
first-order logic it says that there
exists a thing called client a thing
called server a thing called RPC such
that client as a component server as a
component our PC is a connector and if
they're attached in a way we've
described this this contains exactly the
information we saw in the Acme
description but now it's in a form that
can be dealt with by a Thayer improver
or automatic reasoning system</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
