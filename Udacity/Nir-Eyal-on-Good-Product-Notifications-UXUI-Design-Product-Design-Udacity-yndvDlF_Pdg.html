great question so a lot of times when I
teach people about the hook model they
say okay I get the trigger phase right
we need to prompt people to action
but how do we make sure that we don't
spam people how do we know we're not
sending them too many of these triggers
that they become ineffective and there's
there's a secret here the secret is that
we have to closely couple the external
trigger the notification the message
that tells the user what to do with the
internal trigger the internal trigger is
this situation the emotion the routine
the place whatever it is that prompts
the user to act on their own accord so
the closer we can couple these two
things right the closer we can couple
the notification with the sensation or
the urge of oh this is what I need in my
day that's magic
that's the difference between magic and
spam is context so that's the key if you
can closely couple those two and that of
course starts with an examination doing
a bit of a narrative on your user to
figure out when are they most likely to
need this product throughout their day
so don't just willy-nilly send them
notifications all day long but couple
those notifications with a time and
place when your user is more most likely
to actually need the solution so there's
like a delightful moment and you couple
it with a notification right well it's
it's it's a moment when the user has
this need so for example let's say I'm
building an app that plays music right a
music service or a news service right a
great time to couple that need would be
when I have the existing habit of
turning on my radio right so if you
could use geolocation or other data or
time-of-day data or appointment calendar
information something that the user can
tell you about about how they behave day
to day so that you can appropriately
target that trigger at the moment in
time where it feels like magic wow I was
just about to turn on my radio I think
I'll use this app instead</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
