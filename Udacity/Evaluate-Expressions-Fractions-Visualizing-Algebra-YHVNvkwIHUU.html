put three fourths where I see a smiley
face and I have the addition and then I
have 112 for the Diamonds when adding
fractions i need to get a common
denominator so we're going to multiply
this first one by three over three so i
get 9 12 plus 1 12 9 12 2 plus 1 12th is
10-12 i can reduce this fraction by
dividing by 2 and i get 5 6 for this
next one i'm going to replace the smiley
face with three force i have subtraction
and then the diamond is 112 again i need
to convert to a common denominator well
i know three force is really 912 um the
problem before so i have 9 12 minus 112
and when i subtract 9 12 minus 112 is a
12 and the equivalent fraction for 8-12
is two-thirds i divided 8 x 4 and 12 x 4
and i got two thirds here i replace the
smiley face with three force i have
multiplication and then the diamond is
112 i can reduce common factors in the
numerator and in the denominator i
divided three by three and i get one i
divide 12 by three and i get for when i
multiply my fractions across 1 times 1
is 14 times 4 is 16 and 4 this last one
I have three fourths / 112 remember
dividing by a number is the same thing
as multiplying by its reciprocal so I
have three fourths times 12 over 1 I can
reduce a common factor of four since it
appears in the numerator and in the
denominator 12 / 4 is 3 and 4 / 4 is 1 3
times 3 is 9 1 times 1 is 1 so I've 9/1
or nine nice work on that quiz</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
