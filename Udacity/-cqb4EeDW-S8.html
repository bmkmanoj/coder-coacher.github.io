nitty-gritty of fuzzy matching here but
so you understand how fuzzy matching
works it looks at words and calculates a
closeness of match score based on the
similarity of these words you can find
some basic information about two of the
most popular algorithms used in fuzzy
matching in the notes below the video
when we fuzzy match two data sets
together the best practice is to use a
sort of waterfall approach where we go
from most accurate matches down to least
accurate matches the first thing we want
to do is actually join the two data sets
to identify the records that do match
perfectly together and then remove those
records from the mix so that we can
start fuzzy matching the rest of the
records we need to select fields that we
believe will identify the records
uniquely like using their first name
last name and address fields with the
exact match records removed from the
whole data set we then need to decide on
the different set of fields we want to
fuzzy match on for example if we're
working with customers we may have their
first name last name address city state
zip phone number and even their email
using different combinations of these
fields we can build out fuzzy matching
approaches for instance we might want to
start with just first name last name
address and zip code for the remaining
records that did not match we might want
to try first name last name and phone
number for the remaining records that
didn't match again maybe we'll try just
last name and address each time we're
trying to find some duplicates code them
with the methodology used to match them
and then remove them from the set until
we have exhausted all matching methods
the remaining records must be considered
to be non duplicates</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
