calibration and validation namely that
prediction does not always go hand in
hand with understanding look at these
two models for the motion of a planet in
the solar system let's look at the left
model yet the earth is fixed in space
and close to the earth there's the
center of some large circle this point
moves around that circle and a point on
that second circle which then moves in
this fashion this is called an episode
and we can continue that process that
point could be the center of another
circle and so on and so on until finally
we say the planet is moving around that
final circle that's one of the antique
models and let's have a look at the
right one here the Sun is at the center
the earth moves in a circle around the
Sun and that planet moves in circle here
comes the last quiz for you which of
these models allows a more flexible
calibration and which of these two
models allows a more accurate prediction
of the apparent motion of the planet as
seen from a</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
