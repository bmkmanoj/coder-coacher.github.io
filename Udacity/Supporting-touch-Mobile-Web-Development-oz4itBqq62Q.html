events presuming that you really need to
touch is supported across all major
mobile browsers and Chrome Firefox and
opera on desktop as well so touch has
its own set of events touchstart
touchmove touchend and touch cancel
these are somewhat analogous to the
mouse events mouse down mouse move and
mouse up although Mouse events have only
one pointer so the target element and
coordinates of the mouse event are just
on the event object but touch events are
multi-touch so there are three lists of
touches on each touch event object all
the active touches all the touches that
are affecting the current Dom element
and all the change touches in each of
these lists each individual touch is
represented by an object that contains a
unique identifier for the touch the
coordinates of the touch in the target
Dom element in the page although this is
an important difference touch events are
always delivered to the element that
first received that touch they don't
walk across element boundaries like
Mouse events do so it's important to
hook the right elements in fact it's a
good idea to add the touch end handler
during your touch start handler and keep
in mind too that even if you remove a
Dom element from your tree it still gets
the events until the touch ends</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
