at Zealand University in Germany and I
am researching large programs and why
they fail I have done some Fair Work in
automatic debugging also in mining the
histories of programs I've been working
with companies such as Microsoft s ap or
Google examined their bugs finding out
what was wrong and it struck me that
there's almost no teaching material
available on debugging and how to debug
programs so today I'm going to start
with you a course on how to do debugging
systematically effectively and in many
cases even automatically enjoy welcome
to the Udacity course on debugging the
aim of this course is to teach a
systematic approach to debugging and
we're even going to explore a number of
automatic tools that do the debugging
for you we're going to explore how
debuggers work in particular the
scientific method of debugging by which
through a series of experiments we
gradually refine a hypothesis until we
end up with diagnosis on why the program
failed on top of that we're going to
build our own interactive debugger in
python in the next unit I'm going to
introduce you to one of the most
powerful debugging tools ever invented
that is assertions assertions are
statements in the program that
automatically check whether the state of
the program is still correct that is
while your program is executing the
computer constantly monitors the program
on whether a bug has occurred this
allows you to very quickly and
effectively find out where a bug was
first introduced on top of that we're
going to build a tool that makes you
infer assertions from executions in unit
3 I'm going to show you a technique
named Delta debugging which
automatically simplifies problems for
instance gives this 900 line HTML file
which causes a crash in a program which
processes it with Delta debugging you
can reduce this to just the 8 characters
that produce the bug just as well and
all of this
automatically in the next unit I'm going
to show you how to find out where a
specific failure came from if you see an
execution as a series of states we're
going to explore techniques that help
you tracking
the way of an error all through the
program execution and on top of that
we're going to build a tool that
isolates such cause-effect chains
automatically in unit 5 we'll be looking
at reproducing failures we're going to
look at all the various input sources
for your program and discuss how to
capture and replay them such that you
can faithfully reproduce a failure that
happens in the field plus we're going to
explore statistical debugging which
collects data from the field to tell you
which parts of your program are most
likely to be related to the failure in
unit 6 we're going to see how to mine
information from bug databases and
change databases in order to figure out
where bugs have been in your program in
the past where there accumulate and
which parts of your program therefore
are going to be the most bug prone in
the future and again this is a fully
automatic technique if so far you've had
no fun in debugging because well it just
sucks the life out of you the aim of
this course is to get most of the
debugging effort of your shoulders
because you can have the computer take
care of most of the debugging work so
your mind is free for doing something
more creative than debugging</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
