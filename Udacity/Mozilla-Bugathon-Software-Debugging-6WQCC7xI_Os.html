dodd mozilla.org looks like it actually
is almost 900 lines of HTML so you feed
this into the modular browser select
print and it crashes but why in the
early days of Mozilla problem reports
such as this one and failures such as
this one came in quicker than Mozilla
programmers could possibly simplify them
or even look at them but then the
Mozilla product managers had a clever
idea they started the Mozilla baguette
on which meant that volunteers would go
and simplify test cases this was a very
simple process what you need is a text
editor such as this one and then you
would go and remove part of the HTML
page say this for instance run this
through Mozilla and see whether the
failure cell persists and again remove
some part of the input and see whether
the failure still persists again and
again and again and you repeat this
until you have a page left a small page
in which everything is relevant for
reproducing the failure if you do this
and keep on removing one part after the
other and then all of a sudden you end
up in a situation where the failure no
longer occurs after you removed some
part the failure no longer occurs what
do you do next do you put the part you
just removed back in and try to remove
other parts or do you keep only the part
that you just removed and remove
everything else or do you keep on
removing until the failure occurs again
