screens to create a game with multiple
different screens that can display
instead of an application adapter here
we're using a game if we right-click on
game and say go to declaration we can
jump into the source code of the game
class inside libgdx as we see game
implements application listener it seems
that the game class has a screen member
variable and then for each one of the
application or listener callbacks if it
has a screen it then delegates that call
back to the screen here we've declared
two screens one of which displays the
number of frames displayed per second
and the other displays the number of
seconds between the current frame and
the last one to set the active screen we
just need to call set screen on our game
let's check out Delta screen screens are
very similar to application listeners
with a couple differences instead of
create screens get a show call screens
can receive a hida call when another
screen becomes active and the render
call received by a screen includes this
argument called Delta the argument Delta
is the number of seconds after the
previous frame that this frame is
expected to hit the screen in a normal
game running at 60 frames per second
this will be approximately zero point
zero one six seven seconds or 16.7
milliseconds however if your game is
running on old hardware or is just
trying to draw way too much stuff you
may end up with a delta that's larger in
this screen we've created a bitmap font
and a sprite batch and we're just
displaying the Delta that's been passed
into the render call back also we've
included logging on all of the lifecycle
methods so that we can investigate what
happens when we switch screens</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
