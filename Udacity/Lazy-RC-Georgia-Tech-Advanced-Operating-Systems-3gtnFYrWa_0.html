version of the RC memory model and it's
called lr c stands for lazy RC now this
is the structure of your parallel
program so a thread acquires a lock does
the data accesses releases the lock and
other thread may acquire the same lock
and if the critical section 4 p-1
preceeds the critical section 4 p-2 then
the RC memory model requires that at the
point of release you ensure that all the
modifications that have been made on
processor p1 that is the coherence
actions that are commensurate with those
data accesses are all communicated to
all the pier processes including p2 then
you release the lock that's a semantic
and this is what is called eager release
consistency meaning that at the point of
release you're ensuring that the whole
system is cache coherent the whole
system is cache coherent at the point of
release then you released in the lock
and the cache coherence is with respect
to the set of data accesses that have
gone on on this processor up to this
point that's what we are ensuring has
been communicated and made consistent on
all the processes now let's say that the
timeline looks like this and P one's
release happened at this point and
Peter's acquire of the same lock
happened at a much later point in time
that's the luck of the draw in terms of
how the computation went and so there is
this time window between P one's release
of the lock and Peter's acquisition of
the same lock now if you think about it
there's an opportunity for
procrastination now we saw that
procrastination often helps in system
design we've seen this in mutual
exclusion locks if you insert delay
between successive trials of trying to
get the lock that actually results in
better performance we saw there in
process of scheduling to instead of
eagerly scheduling the next available
task maybe you want to wait for a task
that has more affinity to your processor
that results in performance advantage so
procrastination often is a good friend
of system design so here again
there is an opportunity for
procrastination so lazy RC is another
instance where procrastination may
actually help and optimizing the system
performance the idea is that rather than
performing all the coherence actions at
the point of release don't do it
procrastinate wait till the acquire
actually happens at the point of acquire
take all the coherence actions before
allowing this acquire to succeed so the
key point is that you're deafening the
point at which you ensure that all the
coherence actions are complete to the
point of acquisition as opposed to the
point of release even if all the
coherence actions commensurate with the
data accesses that have gone on up until
the release point uh not yet complete
when we hit the release go ahead release
the lock but if the next Lok acquisition
happens at that point make sure that all
the coherence actions are complete so in
other words you get an opportunity to
overlap computation is communication
once again in this window of time
between the release of a lock and the
acquisition of the same luck</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
