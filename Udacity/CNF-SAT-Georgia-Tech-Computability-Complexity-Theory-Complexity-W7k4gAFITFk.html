find a transformation of the formula
such that a truth assignment satisfied
the original if and only if it could be
extended to the transformed formula and
we've seen how to do this transformation
for a single clause but actually this is
enough we can just transform each clause
individually introducing a new set of
variables for each all the same
arguments about extending or restricting
the truth assignment will hold let's
illustrate what a transformation of a
multi Clause formula looks like with an
example consider this formula here where
I've indexed the literal Z with two
indices now the first referring to the
closets in and the second being its
enumeration within the clause the first
clause has only two literals so we
transform it into these two clauses with
three literals by introducing a new
variable y1 one it gets the first one
because it was generated by the first
clause we transform the second clause
with five literals into these three
clauses introducing two new variables y2
1 and Y 2 2 note that these are
different from the variables used in the
clauses generated by the first original
clause since all these sets of variables
are disjoint we can assign them
independently of each other and apply
all the same arguments as we did to
individual clauses that's how CNF can be
reduced to 3 CNF and of course this
transformation runs in polynomial time
making the reduction polynomial we just
reduced the problem of finding a
satisfying assignment to a general CNF
formula to the problem of finding a
satisfying assignment to a 3 CNF form at
this point it's natural to ask can we go
any further can we reduce this problem
to a 2 CNF well no not unless P is equal
to NP there is a polynomial time
algorithm for finding a satisfying
assignment to a 2 CNF formula based on
finding strongly connected components in
a graph therefore if we could reduce
3-cnf to 2 CNF then P would be equal to
NP so 3-cnf is as simple as the
satisfiability question gets and it
emits some very clean and easy to
visualize reductions that allow us to
show that other problems are np-complete
we'll go over two of these first the
reduction to independent set or cleek
and then to subset some</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
