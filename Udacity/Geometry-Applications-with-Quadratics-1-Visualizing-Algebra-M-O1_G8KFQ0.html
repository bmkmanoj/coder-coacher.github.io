8 inches by 4 inches great thinking if
you found these numbers we begin solving
by starting with an equation for the
perimeter and the equation for the area
we know the value of the perimeter here
the perimeter is 24 inches so we can
replace p with 24 for the area equation
we know a equals L times W we can
replace this value of a with its
numerical value 32 now that we have
these two equations we want to solve
this one for the value of L so we can
use substitution to solve will divide
each term by 2 to get 12 equals L plus W
and then we'll subtract w from both
sides to get 12 minus W equals L and now
here comes the substitution we replace L
with this expression 12 minus W here we
multiply each term in the parentheses by
W to get 32 equals 12 w minus w squared
then to solve this quadratic we move
these terms the opposite side of the
equation to set it equal to 0 we factor
this quadratic by finding factors of
positive 32 that sum to negative 12
those factors are negative 8 and
negative 4 and finally we set each
factor equal to 0 so W can equal
positive 8 or W can equal positive 4 we
know the width should be the shorter
dimension so that will be 4 and our
length will be 8 our unit of measurement
isn't an inches on all sides and we can
quickly check to verify the perimeter
and area for our problem if we add up
all the sides around the object will get
24 inches so yes that checks with our
original problem and if we multiply the
length times the width eight times four
equals 32 inches squared which was our
original area now it's ok if you didn't
get all this but hopefully you made your
way at least to the factoring great job
if so</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
