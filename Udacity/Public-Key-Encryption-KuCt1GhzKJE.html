to Cameron without anyone else being
able to see that message if I were to
just place this note on cameron's desk
anyone could come by and read it I could
go find a box with a lock and lock the
message away but then I have to somehow
get this key to Cameron that's not going
to work because anyone will be able to
come by and grab the key but what if
Cameron already had a box set up on his
desk with his own lock and the key to
unlock that box is always in Cameron's
pocket he never shares that key with
anyone I could then come by his desk
place my message in the box and lock it
and no one else can ever see that
message in this example the box is
called the public key the box can be
left out in the open share it around
without any consequence the key and
Cameron's pocket is called a private key
Cameron never lets anybody else borrow
that key or see it this combination of
public and private keys allows me to
securely communicate with Cameron this
same cryptography trick can be used to
authenticate a client with a server the
server will send a random message to the
client the client will encrypt that
message with their private key and then
send that encrypted message back to the
server the server will decrypt this
message with their public key and if
that value equals the same value they
sent then everything checks out and the
client has authenticated</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
