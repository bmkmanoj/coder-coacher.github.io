interfaces and how useful they are now
I'd like to bring up a related topic
called inheritance an interface
specifies behavior that the class that
implements it should exhibit inheritance
can do a little better than that
when a class inherits from another class
it picks up behavior and data here is an
example of a set of classes where one
would probably use inheritance to model
them we have a class vehicle it's a very
general class a car is a special kind of
a vehicle a motorcycle is another kind
of a vehicle the truck is a kind of
vehicle and an SUV is a kind of car now
you would use inheritance not interfaces
in this situation because you could put
common data into the vehicle class such
as the weight of the vehicle the number
of wheels things like that
now you might say why not always use
inheritance it seems better but there
are two issues with it one is it is
complex and also a class can only
inherit from one class whereas a class
can implement as many interfaces as it
likes a bit of terminology the class
from which one inherits is called the
super class and the class that does the
inheriting is called the subclass we
would say truck is a subclass of vehicle
a vehicle is a superclass
of truck just to see that you're paying
attention let me ask you what are the
subclasses of car what are the super
classes of car the subclasses of SUV and
the super classes of SUV in our
inheritance hierarchy over here just put
your answers into these boxes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
