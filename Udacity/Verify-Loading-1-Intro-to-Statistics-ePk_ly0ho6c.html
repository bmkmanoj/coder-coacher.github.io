outcome over here is critical that means
for any of those outcomes you'll be so
surprised that we reject the null
hypothesis with any outcome in the
region over here is okay so we accepted
notice the subtlety here even outcome 11
is okay despite the fact that 11 is very
surprising
it comes to the probability less than 5%
but that's not the way to look at this
the more frequently your sample the more
unlikely each individual outcome is you
look at the articles as blocks when you
implement apart this is testing there'll
be something like a most likely outcome
some between 13 and 14 I guess it's 14
that outcome has to be okay obviously if
you see that you'll be happy and then
you push this in one direction towards
h1 the alternate hypothesis until all
the probabilities remaining cover 5% or
less and that's the critical region so
let's give this another try
last Saturday I went to the magic store
and bought a loaded coin I paid a lot of
money for it and the Wizards
let's hope with that the coin told me
the probability of heads equals 0.3 in
fact there are many buckets of coins the
fair ones the slightly loaded all the
way to the fully loaded and those guys
were cheap in those guys were cheap but
this one over here was really expensive
so I wanted to make sure that I really
got a loaded coin so let's first ask
what's our null hypothesis here eight
choices for the probability of heads
picked abundance best describes the null
hypothesis</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
