notifications on the phone like this
here and how they're automatically
synchronized over to the wearable device
however you might run into a situation
where you want to generate a
notification on a wearable but not on
the phone this is not possible with the
code that we went through earlier the
solution to this is to create a
notification on the wearable device
itself if you create it on the wearable
from within a wearable APK it will only
appear on the wearable it is never
synchronized over to the phone a
notification generated on a wearable
uses exactly the same code is done on
the phone you can use all the same code
that you did previously I just wanted to
point this all out now since you did not
know about wearable apps when we
previously discussed notifications there
are two great samples that you should
refer to in the sample browser
synchronized notifications is the first
and notifications is the other in
synchronized notifications let's load
that one up input sample and synchronize
notifications it's in the wearable
project in notification update service
Java the method we're looking for is
build wearable only notification in this
method you can see the code used to make
a notification is exactly the same as
what you've seen before</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
