managing focus it can be possible to get
a little carried away let me show you an
example so here I've got an autocomplete
widget I can press the tab key to focus
it I can start typing which will give me
this list of city names I press the down
key to focus one and then I can press
tab again to complete the selection now
the next thing I want to do is move to
this next field by pressing tab so hit
tab once more hmm and it looks like I'm
not going anywhere I think what's
happening is this autocomplete thinks
I'm still trying to finish my complete
action so no matter how many times I
press tab I'm just sort of stuck here
this is what's known as a keyboard trap
and it can be very frustrating for users
in fact section two dot one dot two of
the webbing checklist specifically calls
this out stating that keyboard focus
should never be locked or trapped at any
one particular page element the user
should be able to navigate to and from
all page elements using just their
keyboard but strange as it may seem
there are times when this behavior is
actually desirable take for instance the
modal window now normally when a modal
window is displaying on screen we don't
want the user to be able to access any
of the content behind it oftentimes
developers will add an overlay to cover
the page but that doesn't stop keyboard
focus from accidentally traveling
outside of the modal here I'll tab
through this dialog so I'll press the
tab key which will focus the decline
button I'll tab again which focuses the
accept button and I tab one more time
uh-oh it looks like our focus has now
moved behind the modal window now in
instances like this what we want is a
temporary keyboard trap to ensure that
we trap focus within the modal wall it's
displaying and then that we can restore
it to the previously focused item once
the modal is closed this can be a tricky
technique to implement and while there
are proposed ideas on how to make it
easier for developers for instance like
this dialog element here they don't
currently have widespread browser
support meaning we're going to have to
roll up our sleeves and implement this
hour
selves so here's an example of what I'm
going to try to build I've got a little
open modal button up here in the top
corner and when I focus it and hit enter
I get a modal dialog I can tab through
it and the focus is trapped I can hit
that button and it'll close it I can
open it again and I can hit escape or
click the background and it'll close it
and restore focus to that button so this
is what I'm going to work on right now
in my code editor so switching to my
HTML I'll start off by creating a button
element which i'm going to call modal
toggle that's going to be that little
open modal button you saw up there in
the corner then I'm going to have a div
which will hold all of the content for
my modal window I'm going to give it
that class modal inside of here I've got
some text and I've got some input fields
for the user just sign up for our
newsletter and lastly we've got a little
sign up button down here which we're
going to call sign up clicking this will
close our modal window we've also got a
modal overlay down here at the bottom
that's going to be that sort of gray
background clicking that should also
close the modal okay so that's our our
HTML markup now let's look at our
JavaScript over in our JavaScript I'm
going to start by creating this variable
called focused element before modal this
is where I'm going to store a reference
to the element that had focused before
we open the modal when we close the
modal we want to restore focus back to
this element then i'm going to use
document query selector to select both
my modal and my overlay i'm also going
to use query selector to select my modal
toggle button and i'm going to add an
event listener to modal toggle to listen
for the click event which is going to
run this open modal function inside of
the open moodle function we're going to
take that focused element before modal
reference and we're going to grab
document active element and store it
there we're going to listen for key down
events and call this trap keyboard
function which I'll get to in a moment
we're also going to listen to indicators
for us to close our modal so if someone
clicks on the modal overlay we're going
to close the modal and if someone clicks
on the sign up button that's contained
within the modal we're also going to
close the modal
next thing we're going to do is we're
going to try and figure out all the
focusable children that are inside of
the modal dialogue to do this I'm going
to create this huge query string of
potentially focusable elements and i'm
going to call modal query selector all
using that string so this should give me
a grouping of everything within my modal
window that could possibly receive focus
and what I want to do is I want to
figure out what the first element in
that group is and what the last element
in that group is and the idea here is
these can act sort of like Sentinel
elements so if the user is tabbing
through the modal window and then
reached the last focusable element or
the last tab stop and they press tab
again we're going to loop them around
and put them on the first tab stop
similarly if they're on the first tab
stop and then press shift tab we're
going to loop them around and put them
on the last tab stop next we're just
going to tell the modal window to
display itself so we'll set its style to
display block and we'll also set the
middle overlay to display block and then
we're going to focus that first tab stop
child inside of it now from this point
on if the user starts to press a key on
their keyboard we're going to check to
see if they've hit the tab key now using
a modifier key they could have hit shift
tab and if they've hit shift tab what
we're going to do is we're going to
first figure out are they currently on
the first tab stop if they are let's
wrap them around to the last tab stop
and call focus if they haven't hit a
modifier key and they've just hit tab by
itself then we'll say are they currently
on the last tab stop if they are we're
going to wrap them around to the first
tab stop and focus it now we're also
going to add a listener for the Escape
key so if they've hit the Escape key
we're just going to go ahead and close
the modal the close modal method is
pretty straightforward we're going to
tell the modal to display none will tell
the overlay to display none and then
we'll use that reference for that first
focused element and we're going to call
focus on it again to restore focus so in
this case it will restore focus back to
that open modal toggle button now
realize this is a ton of code I sort of
think of the accessible modal window as
like one of the boss battles in
accessibility so what I want you to do
in the next lesson is use some of this
code to implement a modal window
yourself that way you'll have a deeper
understanding of how all of this works</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
