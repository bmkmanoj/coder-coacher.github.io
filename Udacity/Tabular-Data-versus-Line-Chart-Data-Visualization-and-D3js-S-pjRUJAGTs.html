interpret from our line plot is any
trend in the data we can see here
they're short dips in the attendance
that occur fairly regularly with some
period these might be weekends and we
see another fairly large drop towards
the end of the year now while the flu
may be in parent in the tabular data do
the sharp and somewhat extended decline
in attendance it is much easier to spot
with the visual representation of the
data and other more subtle patterns such
as the weekend dips may be impossible to
notice from the tabular representation
alone this is due to the fact that is
not dip to zero or close to zero let's
say because there is weekend classes or
extracurricular activities this is only
a parent when you look at the pattern
over time of the periodic activity of
ups and downs let's say however that I
want to know how many students were in
school on january fourteenth since we
are interested in simply looking up a
specific attendance and a specific day
the table is much easier to understand
as we can look to the exact row we need
and look across to the single number
that represents the attendance for that
day often this behavior of drilling down
to a specific datum in this case january
fourteenth can we incorporate into a
visual graphic through animation and
annotation which is actually what dimple
j/s the library we will use in just a
second allows us to do but in this
example of a static chart is much easier
to look up the attendance for a single
day in the table or I then have to look
at a potentially large and nuanced plot
of days and go across to attendance</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
