of this we just have to write a boolean
formula for each single time step the
second part is also not that difficult
if we're given an algorithm and an input
to that algorithm we already know what
the first snapshot of the RAM is going
to look like the program will start at
the first line of the program code and
the memory contains nothing but the
input itself so given the way that a
boolean formula is written all we have
to ensure is that we enforce the
variables for the first snapshots to
represent that state that we already
know but we can force that so for
example if in a boolean formula you want
a variable x1 to be set to true you
would write it like this you would have
certain statements in the boolean
formula and then you would just put the
variable x1 here and then it continued
the formula and then you know it has to
be set to true so in this way you can
enforce the boolean formula that
represents the first snapshot to present
the memory of the RAM exactly at time
point t equals 0 the fourth one here
that the boolean formula can only be
satisfied if the algorithm returns yes
that is also not that difficult to check
because again using a technique like
this year all we have to do is ensure
that at a certain point in time the
algorithm here is at the program line or
the RAM execute the line of the
algorithm here or one line of the
algorithm here that says return yes so
where that algorithm gives us the yes
value so the only part that requires a
little more thought is the third part
here how we can ensure that various
snapshots fit together</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
