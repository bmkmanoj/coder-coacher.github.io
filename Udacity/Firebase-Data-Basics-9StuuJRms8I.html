you doing great work you've got your
first bit of custom data written into
the database and it only took a few
minutes oh hey JEP is called hey JP we
just wrote our first out of the fire
base and we didn't even have to write a
single acing task or need to deal with
threads I'm glad you like it yeah
actually while I have you on the phone
quick question so you've looked at the
dashboard longer than I have so how is
data actually structured in firebase it
doesn't look like a relational database
to me so what does this firebase data
that I'm editing well you're right about
not being a relational database so let
me show you what it looks like let me
pull up my screen first sequel is a
tabular format with columns and rows
like Excel or a Google spreadsheet
however in firebase data is stored in
JSON it's basically a simple declarative
language used to describe objects and
data it's a lot more flexible than a
tabular format since you don't need to
strictly defined rows or headings JSON
contains a nested structure similar to
xml and also like XML JSON can be
represented in a tree structure oh yeah
I remember Jason from working on
developing android apps I think it was
the format that both open weather map
API and the movies database returned mmm
oh and if you're a developer is
unfamiliar with JSON take them home with
the closes hang out and check out the
links provided the instructor notes to
get you up to speed all right so if I'm
understanding you right the dashboard is
basically a visualization of by Jason
tree and the firebase object that we're
calling methods on in the Android code
that's also an object representation of
it Jason tree right yep okay so what
kind of things can I actually stories
values and Jason it looks like here I
start a string as a key and a strike as
a value so does that mean that any type
that Jason normally accepts is okay
right let me explain well yes mostly the
keys are always strings the values
stored in the tree can be passed in as
bullion's Long's doubles lists Maps and
some specific types of objects there are
also Java types it can be returned from
the tree lists and maps can contain more
lists and more maps and objects can
contain other objects or lists of other
objects
you can have nested data structures
within data structures I know the
dashboard is pretty powerful when you
want to look at your data although it's
hard to tell when you know up too many
entries here's a look at it right now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
