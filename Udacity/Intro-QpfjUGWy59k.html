we're going to continue on our long and
winding excursion through tracking and
in particular what we're going to do
today is we're going to revisit the
whole notion of Bayes based filter
tracking or or or Bayesian tracking and
sort of develop a method that allows us
to do that well so you remember the
tracking with dynamics right so the
whole idea was because we're tracking
something that's moving respect to the
imagery we're going to learn something
about the dynamics and use the dynamics
order to make predictions and we're
doing this so that we can limit the area
of search that we're looking at and also
so that we can get a better total
estimate when we're done under the
assumption that the things we were
trying to track its if you can't
perfectly detect them and it's noisy to
begin with and we're basically making an
assumption that there's some sort of
smooth motion going on and that
essentially our dynamics don't surprise
us is is the underlying element so last
time we developed what was called the
Kalman filter and the Kalman filter was
for linear dynamical systems dynamic
systems where you had gout see and noise
context so what we meant by that was the
motion could be predicted by a linear
factor applied to the motion that you've
estimated and then you add in some
Gaussian noise if you were thinking
about what the uncertainties are same
thing with our measurements they were a
linear function of the state and then
there was some noise and what was nice
about it is everything prediction
correction your lunch break it's all
Gaussian alright and so the only thing
you have to do is maintain the mean and
the covariances of these gaussians and
it just works in 1d or ND etc it's real
easy and the calculations are pretty
straightforward also i mean the
equations look little ugly but it's just
a bunch of matrix multiplies in a couple
of inverses</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
