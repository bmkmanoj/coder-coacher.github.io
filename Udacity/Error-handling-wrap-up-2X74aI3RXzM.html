Android such as making custom
preferences with custom attributes using
support library annotations and using
shared preference listeners most
importantly we've now covered the
primary arrow States for the interaction
points for our app it's important to
take a moment here to remember what
we've done and to talk about how to
generalize this process to work on
whatever app you may be refining first
we identified what interaction points
existed in our app each of which is a
place where errors and bugs can creep in
then we looked at what we had already
done well at each of these points and
what error cases we had not covered
already this gives us a list of issues
to cover to avoid bugs in our app in a
real app we would also want to take user
feedback into account when coming up
with a list of changes to spend
resources on finally it went through
each of the issues and designed a
solution to the problem at hand some of
these solutions were simple and
straightforward some were them were more
complex and required prioritization but
by covering these issues we've made our
app far more comprehensible when air is
inevitably occur</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
