that if one of our nodes fails we're
left with missing data for the file if
the node goes away for example we've got
a 64 megabyte hole in the middle of my
data txt and of course similar problems
with any other files that happen to be
stored on that node to solve this
problem
Hadoop replicates each block three times
as it's stored in HDFS so block one
doesn't just live here it may also be
here and here
block two is here here and here and
block three is here here and here who do
just picks three nodes at random and
puts one copy of the block on each of
the three well actually it's not totally
random but that's close enough for us
right now
so now if a single node fails it's not a
problem because we have two other copies
of the block on other nodes and the name
node is smart enough to see that these
blocks are now under epic ated and it
will arrange to have those blocks re
replicated on the cluster so we're back
to having three copies of them so we've
taken care of the problem if one of our
data node fails but there's another
obvious single point of failure here
what happens if the name node has a
hardware problem might the data be
inaccessible or is the data in HDFS lost
forever or is everything fine and
there's no problem</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
