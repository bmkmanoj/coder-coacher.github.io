out with some of the gleaming glasses
business stuff he's given her yet
another new equation that he says is
going to describe the profit the company
will make if he invests X thousands of
dollars in advertising so we have P of x
equals x cubed minus 20x squared plus
100 18x minus 164 grant wants to figure
out how much money he needs to spend on
advertising to make some sort of profit
but he also wants to avoid spending too
much money so much that it would train
all of his profit away in other words
Athena needs to figure out for what
values of x does this equation p of x
equals zero in other words Athena is
looking for the roots of this function
we're not quite ready to help her answer
this question yet though let's backtrack
for a second first off can you tell me
what the minimum number of real zeros
this function has to have is think
critically about what kind of polynomial
this is</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
