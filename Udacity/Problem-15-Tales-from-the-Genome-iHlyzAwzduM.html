bit tricky we have Darius and we know
that Darius is really hairy he's even
got hair all over his back now his
father has hair on his back just like
this and so does his father's father
Buderus his mother on the other hand
doesn't have any hair on her back so
which of the following can best explain
this it turns out that based on the
information given here it could be
either blending or particulate so we
don't have enough information to
determine this because Darius shares a
trait with one of his parents his father
the blending inheritance model takes
that into account and we could just say
that the father's genes or the father's
influence on Darius was stronger than
that of the mothers but the particulate
model also works because we can explain
how to parents one with a trade and one
without a trade could still pass that
trade on to the next generation so we
need more information particularly more
generational information about the
family</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
