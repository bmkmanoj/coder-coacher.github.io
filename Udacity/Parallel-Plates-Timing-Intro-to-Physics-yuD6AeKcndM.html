to be working with what's called a
parallel plate capacitor and that's a
fancy name but what it really means is
that we have two plates here one on each
side here and we give the left plate a
strong positive charge plus Q and we
give the right plate a strong negative
charge minus Q and this difference in
charges gives rise to an electric field
between the two plates and I've shown
this electric field using field lines
here in red and what's particularly
awesome about the electric field between
two parallel plates is that it's
actually constant so the electric field
here is just as strong as the electric
field here and here and here in here now
it's not completely constant around the
edges we get some bending but we're just
going to stick to the middle of the
plates with a field is constant and
ignore these edge effects so now let's
imagine that i put a proton here right
next to this left plate now since the
proton has a positive charge it should
follow along the field lines and move in
this direction and since this field is
constant this proton should move with a
constant acceleration all right now can
you tell me if the separation between
the two plates is d how long will it
take this proton to move from this side
of the parallel plates over to this side
so here's some values you'll need to
solve the problem the electric field
strength is 1,000 Newton's per Coulomb
the plate seperation is 1 centimeter and
here's the mass of the proton and the
charge of a proton so you can put your
answer down here and give your answer in
nanoseconds which corresponds to 10 to
the minus 9 normal seconds good luck</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
