canvas as well and I'm gonna go ahead
and demonstrate one right here it begins
with this command begin path which we're
calling on the context of the canvas
begin path tells a canvas that we're
about to draw a new shape then we use
this command move to now with move to in
line two it makes actually a lot of
sense to think about a pen actually
moving on the page move to moves a pen
to a specific location on the canvas
which is designated by the X&amp;amp;Y
coordinate here so this command moves
the pen to 1010 which is going to be
about right here you can think of move 2
as just moving the pen but the pen isn't
making a mark yet we're just deciding
where we want to put it down on the page
but then when we call line 2 we actually
put the pen down and make us mark or in
this case a line to this position so
this line here with move to 1010 moves
the pen or hovers it over 1010 then when
we call line 2 we put the pen down and
then move it to the position of 50/50
then we move it again and move it again
if we refresh the page we'll see that
there's nothing there despite the fact
that it looks like we made a shape that
eventually goes back to where we started
at 1010 that's because we need to call
either a fill or a stroke command to
finish up this path let's start by doing
fill I will go ahead and uncomment this
line hit save come over here and hit
refresh and we see that we create a
filled shape this made a triangle so now
we see a filled in triangle if we
comment in fill and then uncomment
stroke let's see what happens we'll save
come over here and hit refresh
and now we see a stroke triangle that's
not filled in there are many other
drawing commands that you can use in the
canvas and check out the link in the
instructor notes if you want to learn
more about them but most of them behave
similarly to what we see here for this
quiz we want you to recreate the shape
that you see here with the canvas I've
gone ahead and marked a few points on
the outside square in the inside
triangle that should make your life a
little bit easier as you try to recreate
it after you're finished it check this
box to continue</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
