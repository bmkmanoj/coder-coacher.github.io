to mention about q-learning first is
that the success of Q learning depends
to some extent well to a large extent on
exploration so we need to explore as
much of the state and action space as
possible one way to accomplish this is
with randomness and the way we can
interject that fairly easily in the step
of Q learning where we are selecting an
action we flip a coin and randomly
decide if we're going to randomly choose
an action so that means really two flips
of the coin the first is our we're going
to choose a random action or are we just
going to pick the action with the
highest Q value then if we decide okay
we're going to choose an action randomly
now when we need to flip the coin again
to choose which of those actions we're
going to select typical way to implement
this is to set this probability at about
0.3 or something at the beginning of
learning and then over each iteration to
slowly make it smaller and smaller and
smaller until eventually we essentially
don't choose random actions at all what
we gain here is when we're choosing
these random actions fairly frequently
is we're forcing the system to explore
and try different actions in different
states and it also causes us to arrive
at different states that we might not
otherwise arrive at if we didn't try
those random actions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
