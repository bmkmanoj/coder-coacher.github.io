looking for Y values along the pink
curve that are greater than the Y value
of the purple curve since the paint
corresponds to the left side of the
equation and the purple corresponds to
the right side of the equation and we
want left to be greater than right so
the line y equals x squared minus 16 is
above the line y equals 0 well above the
purple line that means that the x value
of any point on the pink line that's
above the purple line should satisfy
this inequality let's check one just to
be sure while these end points these
points of intersection are the points
negative 40 and 40 that means that the X
values in this region above the purple
line X is less than negative 4 in this
portion of the curve and x is greater
than 4 over here and remember that was
the solution set we found for this
inequalities that's perfect almost
exactly the same thing happens in graph
be again solutions are found above the
purple line since you want x squared to
be greater than 16 and y equals 16 is
the purple line the points of
intersection in this case are negative 4
comma 16 and 4 comma 16 even though the
Y values of those points are different
the X values are exactly the same in
fact this graph is simply the same as a
just shifted upward 16 to be clear each
and a quality that we're looking at only
has one variable in it we only care
about X values what these graphs help us
do is portion out the coordinate planes
that we can see which x-values do
satisfy these equations so over here in
graph a any points in either the region
to the left or this region to the right
will have X values that satisfy this
equation the areas that aren't shaded in
our areas where we can't guarantee
whether or not the X values will satisfy
this and we have a similar thing
happening in graph B I know that
connecting graphs and equalities in this
way might seem a little bit confusing at
first they hope that you at least
thought it was interesting</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
