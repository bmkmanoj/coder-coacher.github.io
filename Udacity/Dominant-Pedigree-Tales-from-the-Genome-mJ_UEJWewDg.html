could be is actually the heterozygous
genotype plus minus now what's the
reasoning behind this well we know right
off the bat because it's a dominant
trait and he's affected that he can't be
homozygous recessive the minus minus
because this scenario is the normal
height or the unaffected individual we
know he's affected so we can't be that
but now the question is we know he has
at least one achondroplasia allele one
of the plus alleles but how do we know
if he has one or two if he's homozygous
or heterozygous and for that answer
we're going to look at his children
specifically the unaffected son he has
three children total to affected
daughters one unaffected son if he is in
fact homozygous dominant for the plus
allele that causes achondroplasia then
we would expect all of the children to
be affected because he would have to
pass on at least one of these dominant
alleles but the fact that his son is
unaffected means that his son did not
get a dominant allele we know that the
mother obviously didn't give him a
dominant allele and the father couldn't
have given him a dominant allele because
he's unaffected this must mean that he
has two unaffected alleles and one of
them came from the father which means
the father must be heterozygous</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
