us we need two dimensions or even three
dimensions we need vectors if you know
about vectors directly skip to the quiz
if you don't stay with me vectors can be
represented by arrows typically we
denote vectors by lowercase letting
characters with an arrow on top of them
and we can also express them in numbers
this arrow vector is 4 units to the
right and three units up which is why we
can write for 3 in this way these are
called components of the vector X
component Y component if the x axis
points right and the y axis points up
let's look at a second vector if you
call this vector B that would be 2 1 X
component 1 x component 2 let's have a
third vector that's called C and C
should be 1 minus 3c goes right by 1
unit and goes down by three units and
now we can do some basic arithmetic sui
can add vectors for instance let's add B
and see if we want to add B and C we put
them together the tale of C goes to the
tip of B or the other way around and the
resulting vector which is B plus C goes
from the tail of B to the tip of C so
this is the sum of the vectors B plus C
and if you look closely you see this is
1 2 3 units to the right and this one is
cancered with that one and two units
down so what we actually could have
computed is the X component of B plus
the X component of c3 and the y
component of B plus the Y component of C
makes two that's the sum of vectors you
simply add the components and
geometrically you chain these arrows and
there's a second operation we can do we
can multiply vector
us with numbers for instance if i want
to multiply this vector B by three
halves I get an arrow in the same
direction but worth fifty percent more
length I can do that in components of
course as well so what I get is three
halves x 2 and 3 halves x 1 which is
three and down stairs 1.5 obviously
three units to the right one point five
units up if you do this multiplication
with negative numbers we're going to
invert the direction of the arrow so if
I compute say minus one half be i get an
error of the opposite direction and half
the length in components minus one half
times 2 is minus one minus one half
times 1 is minus one half so this goes
one unit to the left and half a unit
down if you remember the lump I package
in Python this vector addition and
vector multiplication and the numpy
package in Python this edition and this
type of multiplication is already
included the third operation that we can
apply to all vectors is determining
their lengths I'm writing it like that
with double bars to determine the length
we can simply use the Pythagorean
theorem one leg of this right triangle
is 4 units long the other leg is 3 units
long which means that the hypotenuse is
4 squared plus 3 squared square root
units long which means 16 plus 9 25
square root 5 units</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
