probably realized that sometimes when
you try something in code it just
doesn't work the first time these errors
are called bugs and Carl has thought a
lot about bugs and how to get rid of
them
you know Andy writers spend a lot of
time proofreading and scientists spend a
lot of time checking their results but
it was a surprise to early programmers
that debugging was going to be a thing
maurice wilkes the cambridge physicist
who built one of the first computers had
something to say about this discovery by
june 1949 people had begun to realize
that it was not so easy to get a program
right as had at one time appeared the
realization came over me with full force
that a good part of the remainder of my
life was going to be spent finding
errors in my own programs that is so
true and it's something I didn't
understand when I was learning to code I
thought that every bug I was introducing
into my own programs but some failure on
my part as a programmer but I realize
now that bugs are inevitable they're
going to happen and so the important
thing isn't to avoid them entirely it's
to develop a strategy for systematically
getting rid of them it's not so much
about spotting typos or logic errors as
it is about building a correct mental
model of how that system works so that
you can find out what isn't working in
this lesson I'll show you some
techniques that can help you make
debugging part of your learning process</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
