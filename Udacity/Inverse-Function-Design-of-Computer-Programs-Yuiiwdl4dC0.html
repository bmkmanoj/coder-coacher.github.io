power of functions as tools by computing
inverse functions and doing the work
just once rather than having to do it
for each function what do I mean by that
the square function for squaring numbers
is easy right to square X we just return
x times X but if we wanted to define the
square root function well that's a lot
harder
assuming we didn't have the
exponentiation operator built-in if we
wanted to define it in terms of
elementary arithmetic that's a lot of
work Isaac Newton came up with a way to
do it but he's Newton for those of us
who aren't wouldn't it be great if
instead of having to write all this code
to define the square root we could just
say square root is the inverse of square
and be done with it well and there's
homework we're gonna do just that we're
gonna do it in a slightly restricted
sense we're only gonna deal with
functions that are defined on
non-negative numbers and are
monotonically increasing so they have to
keep on going up that way they have a
defined inverse functions that are not
monotonic don't have a single inverse
because there's a two to one mapping so
here's my definition of inverse I'm
going to give you a simple version and
then ask you to write a more efficient
one so what do you what is inverse do it
takes a function f and returns a
function f1 and the way it figures out
what to do is it says let's start at
zero because we said this was a function
defined on the non-negative numbers and
asked is this f of X greater than the Y
that were that's being passed to f1 if
it is let's increment X by a little bit
a little bit being Delta which here I've
defined as one 128th but you can define
it as what you want when you're asking
for the inverse and keep on going until
we find an f of X which is not less than
Y and now X is too big it's greater than
or equal to Y and X minus Delta is too
small it's less than Y so we're
somewhere in between the two and we want
to pick the closest one and that's what
this expression does it says we know the
result is somewhere in there and we want
to choose which one is closer and how
does that work well we can define square
we can ask for the square root of a
hundred I guess I missed a step in here
where I have to say that square root is
equal to the inverse of square and now
when we ask for the square root of 100
we get exactly ten point oh that's the
right answer
when we asked for the square root of 99
we get nine point nine five something
and that's pretty close although there
are more accurate representations that
the computer could come up with when we
asked for the square root of 100 million
we get 10,000 exactly which is exactly
the right answer but it took a little
bit too long it took almost a second to
come up with this result and I'd like it
to go much faster and so that's what I'm
going to ask you to do I want you to
modify inverse so that it has a run time
closer to the logarithm of the input to
f1 rather than to linear in the input to
f1 and I'll give you two hints of things
to consider
one is binary search and the other
Newton's method so do some research on
those and then modify the definition of
inverse so that when we say square root
equals inverse of square the whole
function runs faster</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
