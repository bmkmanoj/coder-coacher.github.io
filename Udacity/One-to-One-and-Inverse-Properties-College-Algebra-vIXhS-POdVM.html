work out nicely but what if we don't
have numbers that are as pretty as these
that work this easily together let's
stick with 4 to the X but how about on
the right-hand side of the equation we
put something different like 121 now
this problem is not as simple as the
last two we can't easily make 121 into a
power of 4 so I think we need to go back
to our knowledge of properties in
particular properties of exponents and
logs we have some one-to-one properties
there's this one that we just talked
about if we know that a to the x equals
a to the Y then we also know that x
equals y and similarly we have this
second one if we know that log base a of
X is equal to log base a of Y then we
also know that x equals y we also have
some inverse properties properties that
demonstrate that exponential and
logarithmic functions are each other's
inverses the first one is that a to the
power of log base a of X is equal to X
here's the first one a to the power of
log base a of x equals x and the second
one says that log base a of a to the X
is equal to X this is just showing that
logs and exponents undo one another now
keeping these in mind let's go back to
that equation we were working with and
here it is again 4 to the x equals 121
now as you did in earlier lessons I
think we should take the log of both
sides after all we want to extract the X
from the exponent here one of those two
inverse properties was this one that if
we have something like a to the X just
as we do here if we take log base a of
that will just end up with X on this
side of the equation that sounds pretty
good to me so thinking about the
equation that we have what base should
the log that we apply to both sides be
in other words what should a here equal</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
