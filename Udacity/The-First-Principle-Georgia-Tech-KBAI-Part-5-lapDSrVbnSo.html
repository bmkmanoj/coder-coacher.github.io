enumerated seven major principles of
knowledge-based AI agents that we will
cover in CS 70 637 let us wrap up this
close by revisiting each of the seven
principles here is the first one
knowledge-based AI agents represent an
organized knowledge into knowledge
structures to guide and support
reasoning so the basic paradigm here is
represent and reason represent and
reason if you want to reason about the
world you have to represent knowledge
about the world in some way you not only
want to represent this knowledge to
support reasoning you also want to
organize this knowledge into knowledge
structures to guide to focus the
reasoning let us look at a few examples
that we covered in this course about
dispensable semantic networks not only
allow us to represent knowledge about
the world they also allow us to organize
that knowledge in the form of a network
we use semantic networks to address the
problem of the guards and prisoners
dilemma the advantage of the semantic
networks was that they exposed it
constraint so this problem so clearly so
that we could infect reason about it and
notice that the organization helps us
focus the reasoning because of the
organization there's so many other
choices we don't have any have the
reason about them frames were another
knowledge structure that organized
knowledge and guided and supported
reasoning given frames for things like
earthquakes we could reason about
sentences like a serious earthquake
killed 25 people in a particular country
we also use frames to support common
sense reasoning here a shock is moving
its body part to a sitting position here
a shock is moving himself into a sitting
position here Andrew sees a ship now and
removes to the same place as a joke and
Andrew then moves the menu to a ship
this is about a story about visiting a
restaurant once again there is knowledge
structures here it is not a structure so
not only represent acknowledge their
organizing knowledge into a sequence of
actions these knowledge structures how
generate expectations so we know what a
shock expects to happen next in any of
these situations we also know how show
can detect surprises when the
non-obvious thing happens sure
knows it has warranted the expectations
of the scripts and can do something
about it this is how the scripts support
and guide reasoning we also saw this
principle in action when we were talking
about explanation based learning in
order to show that an instance was an
example of a particular concept cup we
constructed complex explanations in this
case we were constructing the complex
knowledge structure on the fly are those
smaller knowledge structures the
smallest knowledge structures came out
of precedence or examples we had already
known then we composed the eight
knowledge of these various knowledge
structures into a complex explanation to
do over reasoning to guide and support
your reasoning we have seen this
principal reduction in several other
places in this course this is one of the
fundamental principles represent
organized reason</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
