us to the end of what I wanted to talk
about anyway so can you help me remember
what it is that we've learned today in
particular what you've learned today
sure so I guess the first thing I
learned is that game theory can make you
depressed and in fact in particular that
my friend Charles given the opportunity
would totally drop a dime on me just to
save a month of incarceration yeah wait
no no no no I don't think you summarized
that correctly game theory is not
depressed
it's depressing well yeah that's a good
point that's a good point and Michael is
not cruel he is the victim of cruelty I
don't think so because you want to know
what the secret area Michael is you've
got a little matrix of numbers those
numbers capture what's going on the
truth Michael is that if we were in
prisoner's dilemma
I would cooperate with you because my
utility is not simply the number of
months that I would spend in jail but
it's the number of months
you also would spend in jail ooh
interesting so if I the best way to beat
a prisoner's dilemma is to change the
numbers I see it's like the Kobayashi
Maru of game theory exactly so there's
an interesting question for you right
there Michael if I had prisoner's
dilemma here here let's write it out so
you can remember if I have prisoner's
dilemma here we already know that we're
gonna end up here because that's what
the numbers tell us to do but what we'd
have to do is change the game so how
would you change the game in prisoner's
dilemma
I see so if we're thinking about it and
in particular in terms of I care about
how long you spend in jail maybe not as
much as I care about how much I spend in
jail like maybe half as much mm-hmm then
the payments shift right right now we
have like - one and a half - one and a
half in the upper left hand corner
mm-hmm - nine comma - 4 and a half -
four and a half - 9 and minus nine -
nine
so now that that bottom right becomes a
lot less attractive if we actually care
about the other person right that's
that's that's okay I'm less depressed
now except of course that requires that
you feel that way internally and that I
feel that way internally there's another
way that you could change the game here
which is what happens to snitches in
jail they are rewarded no no they're not
they're punished yes so if you're a part
of the criminal fraternity and you don't
like prisoner's dilemma then what you
have to do is you have to create a
system where the people who snitch get
punished so it's not just the months
that they spend in jail it's everything
else that's going to happen to them if
they drop a dime so you're saying that -
six - six ends up being worse know what
I know the - wait no wait what yeah oh
the zero ends up getting oh oh I see the
zero ends up being worse because even
though you're not in jail you're gonna
get I don't know somehow Ward it or or
punished for your past behaviors
accosted that's right so that's what you
have to do and that works not just with
criminals but with the real world
whenever you're in this sort of
situation like a prisoner's dilemma you
can change the game by changing
everyone's utilities by for example
hiring police office or police officers
or hiring members of the mob to take
care of everything
I see so it almost seems like what
you're talking about is the kind of
inverse game theory where if there's a
particular behavior that I want to see
how do I set up the payments and reward
so that that behavior is encouraged
right and by the way that has a name and
it's called mechanism design yes I'm not
sure I understand those words well
that's where you're trying to set up the
set of incentives the mechanisms that
you're using to pay people you're trying
to design them in such a way to get
particular behavior this is what a lot
of economics is all about this is what a
lot of government is about tax breaks
for example for mortgage interest
encourages you to buy a home rather than
a rental home I see by changing the
payoff structure right oh that's neat
yeah and so that's what we learned today
at least right now okay all right so
let's see so just to try to rattle off
some of the other things the whole
notion of game theory we talked about
especially the idea that you can think
about a game as a tree or you could
represent it as a matrix and I believe
you said repeatedly the matrix has
everything said how you said it the
matrix is all you need yep let's see we
talked about me
and Maxime in mm-hm we relaxed a bunch
of constraints on games so we we looked
at both perfect and hidden information
mm-hmm
we looked at both zero-sum and non zero
sum and we learned a lot today we looked
at deterministic and stochastic I would
want to say but you called it
non-deterministic and assuming that we
can get rid of the first two bullet
items that look like maybe they were
jokes
I would suggest saying things like we
talked about what strategies are and
then they come in different flavors we
talked about the evil prisoner's dilemma
game mm-hmm what else you got to give me
more otherwise it's saying Oh more good
point Andrew Moore gave lots of really
good examples oh yes Michael may be
cruel but Andrew Moore is awesome
he's more cool than me Andrew Moore is
very cool all of the examples that we've
used today or almost all of the examples
we use today actually come from Andrew
Moore's slides Andrew Moore is a
professor at Carnegie Mellon or at least
he was before he went off to Google and
is a really smart guy who cares very
much about machine learning and game
theory and produced a bunch of slides
that it turns out lots and lots of
people use in their own courses and his
examples were so good for game theory
that I decided to coop them with his
permission of course he tells everyone
that they may use them and in fact we
have pointers to his slides in the
resources links and folders for all of
you to look at and I recommend that you
do do we learn anything else Michael the
only other thing that I would want to
mention is Nash hmm which is a concept
that is nest tastic it is Nash tastic
there are by the way I should mention
briefly other kinds of equilibria
concepts there beyond the scope of this
class but there's a whole lot more to
game theory as you might imagine and
sometimes with Nash gets you in these
situations where you can't do what you
want to do you end up in these
prisoner's dilemma situations other
kinds of equilibria can get you out of
it and I'm going to argue without
explaining why that the way they get
around it is by introducing other ways
of doing various kinds of communication
and in fact I claim there a particular
part of mechanism
but that's a topic for another day okay
fair enough
okay did we learn anything else Michael
I don't know that's that's what I was
thinking about I mean that seems like a
lot to absorb and the other thing is
that repeated games even the prisoner's
dilemma kind of unravel if you know when
they end and I was gonna try to look
into what happens if you don't know when
they're gonna end okay so I guess that
will be something that we will learn
next time right what what will we have
we'll learned yes future past tense all
right Michael I think that's about it at
least my brain is full so I will talk to
you next time and you get to lead what I
believe is the last full lesson of the
course Oh exciting it is exciting
all right well bye Michael you have fun
I'll see you next time all right bye
Charles bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
