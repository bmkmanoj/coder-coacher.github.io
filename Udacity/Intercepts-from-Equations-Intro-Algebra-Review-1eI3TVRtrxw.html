intercepts off of the graph but we also
learned something else interesting here
at the x intercept the y value is always
0 and at the y intercept the x value is
always 0 I think we can use that to do
something pretty interesting what these
facts are going to let us do is find the
intercepts of a graph without actually
seeing the graph just by looking at the
equation let's say we had this equation
I can find the x-intercept of this
equation by setting the Y value to 0 and
then solving for x so in this case 2x
plus 0 equals 6 divide both sides by 2
and x equals 3 so it looks like the
x-intercept would be at three comma 0
and define the y-intercept well I know
the x value is going to be zero so I'm
going to start with my same equation but
now i'm going to set x equal to 0 and
solve for y well 2 times 0 is just 0
this tells me that y equals 6 which
means the y intercept is that 0 comma 6
then once I have my points I can draw a
line to connect them and there I have my
graph maybe you can answer a question
for me now what are the intercepts of 3x
minus 2y equals 12 entered the x and y
intercept as XY coordinate pairs</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
