input parameters to the time class but
what happens if there's more setters and
getters which can all compromise the
state let's assume we have a method
advance which takes a number of seconds
by which to advance the time for
instance a value of 3600 would advance
the time forward by one hour whereas a
minus 60 would set back time by one
minute here's our advanced method I skip
the details of the computation right now
but instead we focus on the
postcondition we assume we do have a
method second since midnight which
returns in the number of seconds that
have elapsed in this very day then we
can set up a post condition which simply
says that after we advance the time then
the new second since midnight should be
the old value plus the offset of seconds
all of this modulo the number of seconds
in a day such that we probably take care
out of advances that go beyond or before
midnight the method second sims midnight
is rather straightforward to implement
to the hours times 3,600 plus the
minutes times 60 plus the second so
again we use a helper function to help
us define our post condition but for all
of this to work we need to make sure
that even after the complex computation
the state of the time object is still
sane that is minutes hours and seconds
are still within the right ranges no
matter what happens in this complex
computation and this is not checked at
this point what we need here is a
property that always holds in computer
science parlance we call such a thing an
invariant an invariant is a condition
that always hold for some data object
what does always mean always means from
the perspective of a user of that object
that is at the beginning and at the end
of each public method while the method
is executing invariance can and
frequently must be violated but when the
method is done invariant should hold
again for our time object the invariant
condition is already encoded here in the
argument checker in the precondition of
the initializer but now we want to check
this condition over and over
again at the end and at the beginning of
each public method what we do is we
write an invariant checker this
invariant checker called czech rep here
checks whether the internal
representation is sane or correct in our
case we simply set up three assertions
the check whether hours minutes and
seconds are within the right ranges once
we do have such a checker we can now use
this in all functions at the beginning
or at the end as appropriate for
instance after initialization we invoke
Czech rep and then make sure whether the
internal state is within the right
ranges this is also true for setters
like advanced before we change something
we check whether the invariant is
satisfied and we do the same after the
computation such that if the computation
in some way messes up hours minutes or
seconds then Czech rep will immediately
find this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
