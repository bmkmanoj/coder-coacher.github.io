interesting thing about this equation
and here it is notice the Z value of the
point so this is written in a funny way
right this is Z of XY what does that
mean that means if I'm at some point XY
I remember that's a ray in space right z
in the course my camera is the depth of
that point you'll notice that this thing
is made up of two terms the a term in
the B term the a term has the
translation in it the B term has the
rotation in it the depth is only in the
a term the translation term why think
about motion that happens if you
remember a projective camera just has
raised out in space and you can leave
the Rays is going out till they hit
something and they stop okay now if I
rotate those Ray's affect me i can draw
this so here's my point and here's a
whole bunch of rays let's suppose here's
my image plane for frame one okay if I
rotate some angle my image plane will
now be there so before this ray was
hitting at that point on the plane and
now it's hitting at this point on the
plane so if before I was in the middle
now it's to the right hand side okay
fine notice I didn't tell you how far
out the Rays went because as the image
plane rotates and it cuts through the
Rays it doesn't matter how far the Rays
go so the depth has no impact on the
amount of motion that you see as you
rotate but if I translate the depth
matters a lot remember the whole thing
about the moon right the moon seems to
follow you and we're going to
demonstrate this right now so now get
out your rulers on the screen right I'm
going to take a step to the right like
that okay so the amount of motion that
you saw is whatever it is all right now
I take the same size step Megan that I
move in more of the field did I move
much further across the field than I did
when I was in the back Megan's going yes
in other words the amount of motion you
get this is called motion parallax as a
function of the depth so that really
dorky demonstration is why the Z value
is only in the term that has the
translation component if you don't
translate the depth doesn't matter in
terms of how much things move that's why
we talked about when you build panoramas
from rotation I can just map the planes
I can map the Rays because it didn't
matter what the depth was this is the
general motion model I hope this was not
too pedantic I like tying back the stuff
we're doing now with this the stuff we
did before</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
