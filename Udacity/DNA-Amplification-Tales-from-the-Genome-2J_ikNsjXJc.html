the DNA extraction you essentially have
taken our sample and like you said sort
of purified the DNA from it gotten rid
of all the other stuff two proteins the
other molecules that might be part of
cells and other kinds of contaminants
and you pretty much just have a purified
DNA product exactly now is that enough
already to do what you want to do with
it or what do you have to do next not
really it's common in many situations
like this to want to amplify the DNA so
you always want to give yourself the
best opportunity to sequence what's in
there and the easiest way to do that is
to take the DNA you got and amplify it
or copy it as many times as you can so
that you just have enough signal but you
make it easy on yourself I see so when
you say you're amplifying or you're
making copies I mean are you controlling
kind of how many copies you make you
just you know you're making like 10 more
20 more you know 100 more how does that
work it's not tightly controlled but in
essence at the end of the process you
end up with a thousandfold enrichment of
the DNA so you really do end up with a
lot more DNA so do you end up with DNA
left over you know after you're done
with the procedure actually have
leftover DNA for four people sometimes
we do but usually we store your DNA and
it's in the saliva form so that we're
going back to the original copy one
issue with amplification is that every
time you copy just like in DNA
replication in humans there's a
possibility for error so those errors
could compound if you keep copying the
copy just like xeroxing a Xerox right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
