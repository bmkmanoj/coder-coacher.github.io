we can make it a quiz but I'm not gonna
make it a quiz what is the value of the
game at P equals point four so I just
plug it in to those equations and so
negative ten times 0.4 is like negative
four plus five is one so I'm gonna say
one mmm-hmm so the value here is in fact
one cent and if you put it in the other
question you'd get the same thing yes
right because they're equal there that's
actually the answer to the entire kit
and kaboodle if sorry well where were
the kittens if a chooses a mixed
strategy where with probability 0.4 he
chooses to be a holder notice that it
doesn't matter whether it be as a
resigner or be as a seer you will end up
here and there will be a value of plus
one penny to a on average the expected
value is ya plus one now you might ask
yourself well what if B decides to be a
smarty pants and also do a mixed
strategy what do you think would happen
in that case
so of course it changes something but it
doesn't change the value of the game
because B if B is a resigner a is
getting one on average if B is a seer
then a is getting one on average and an
any average any convex combination of
one and one is going to give us one
that's exactly right so in fact if you
think about it if he tries to do a mixed
strategy between these two lines it's
going to have to be for every single
point between the two lines somewhere
the average is going to be somewhere in
between there no matter how you weight
that average so it's like a bowtie is
the space of possible payoffs right and
since for any let's say if I just if B
decided to pick some you know some
values such that it's in this region of
the space and it's going to end up
somewhere say between here that's fine
or here that's fine or here that's fine
or here that's fine or here that's fine
more importantly right here it's going
to have to be between the two lines but
those two lines cross so no matter what
mixed strategy B chooses on average we
will end up here so the value of this
game is the expected value of this game
and it is plus one for a now ok now hang
on so why is that why is it not I mean
there's other values that could be
obtained there's a
is five there's a plus five true like
why is it plus one well it's plus one
here on average on average the expected
value of this game is plus one so you
say that the strategy for a is to choose
point four but why like why is that of
all the different values what what it's
just because the lines intersect I don't
understand what makes that a good idea
for a like it's not like it gets any
additional payoff for for having things
intersect well if a is going to choose a
mixed strategy and B is going to choose
a mixed strategy this is the mixed
strategy for a that guarantees an
expected value of plus one meanwhile
let's so imagine that this is the way
you're gonna set it up so we've been
kind of talking in general that a is
gonna choose a strategy B is gonna
choose a strategy then they're gonna go
and that because we know everyone's
rational you already know which strategy
B is gonna pick and B already knows
which strategy a is gonna pick right
because we've made this assumption about
everyone's trying to maximize their own
utility of their own reward so in a
mixed strategy if you know you're gonna
go for a mixed strategy you have exactly
the same situation we can figure out
well what is it that a should choose an
age good fit can figure out what is it B
should choose so notice that in this
particular version of the game the way
it's set up even if a announced
beforehand to be listened I am going to
choose to be a holder with probability
0.4 it doesn't matter what B chooses the
expected value is this it's plus 1 right
yeah but imagine that a said well I'm
gonna pick I'm gonna choose to be a
holder with probability one more than
what should be do B should choose to be
a seer right it's exactly the situation
we were in before
okay but here's the here's the thing I'm
having trouble wrapping my head around
so is it's not special that it's an
intersection what's special maybe is it
that you know if B is always okay so
legging what you said before that a is
gonna announce the strategy so for
anything that a can announce B is going
to presumably do whatever's best for B
right which is to minimize right mm-hmm
so if you look at that triangle at the
bottom mm-hmm if you think about that is
those lines that V upside down V shape
yeah exactly that thing if you think
about that as being the payoffs the pay
function for a as a function of the
probability P that it chooses to hold
mm-hmm then we've chosen the maximum
right right we're trying to find the
probability for which a gets the highest
expected value and that it's at the it's
at that peak there mm-hmm but notice
something Michael for any case where the
two lines cross you're gonna have a
function of this form ah let's be sure
of that because that's I wasn't seeing I
was thinking that that was not true
because basically in this case we have a
line of positive slope and a line of
negative slope mm-hmm right so what if
we we can have an intersection between
two lines of negative slope uh-huh so
again by doing the same exercise you
were doing before where you draw the you
sort of take the minimum of the two
lines at all points yeah you'll end up
with this where do you pick it then the
far left P equals zero yeah but not the
intersection in particular no that's
true okay all right I just it wasn't
quite getting that but so the
intersection is special because in some
cases that is where the max is it
Cannell I guess the max can only be in
those three places right it could be far
left far right or the intersection
there's no other way to have a maximum
of lines right and by the way there's
another case like this where they never
actually cross or like this where they
never actually cross got it right but in
either case right it's always going to
be those three points it's going to be
the extrema or where they cross if they
happen to never cross and that point
goes away and she just picks the pick
pick the maximum so what you could so in
fact if you wanted to think of an
algorithm to choose the right thing to
do for a you basically plot the lines
you take the min at every point and you
find the maximum point oh I see so you
could just kind of discretize it almost
yeah when you're done it seemed
reasonable
well discretizing seems problematic but
like I get that I get that we're trying
to find the probability so that we
maximize right oh wait we maximize the
minimum of the two other things so it's
like maxi min again yeah except here so
in fact it is exactly minimax or Max and
min except I guess if you're thinking it
from a point of view it's minam ax or
max and min but in this case there's
this other parameter which is the
probability which is how you determine
how you're doing
max got it right in this bigger space
it's many I see yeah yeah that makes
sense
what about so but why is a the one who
needs to be random why does it be the
one who needs to be random it's you
didn't with the saint you end up in the
same place because again remember you're
doing this kind of optimal notion where
underneath all of that is this belief
that both people are going to be
rational so the only reason to do this
to take the you know maximum minimum is
if you believe that B is always going to
try to minimize what you do but B is in
exactly the same situation right from
B's point of view that's what's
happening huh it's the same equations
yeah just it gets turned around that's
actually an interesting exercise maybe
that's a nice homework assignment okay
so did that all make sense to you now
safely but yeah sure
that's cool that's how you know when
you're done Michael when it's all green
and scribbly does this generalize to
more than two options it seems like it's
going to get messy fast yes it does it
generalizes to to more than two options
effectively now you're just doing a max
over in things instead of two things and
you have to search for there's possibly
way more intersections to worry about
yeah but all you care about is the
minimum think of it as you're always
drawing the minimum function</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
