excited about Salesforce and we're
really excited to teach this course I
started working at sales for six years
ago and while it was initially excited
to be working for the undisputed leader
in cloud computing we really got me
excited was working on the platform and
the limitless possibilities of what you
can build on salesforce and I don't work
at Salesforce i work at Udacity because
I like teaching people things things
that will help them improve their life
and I think if you learn Salesforce you
actually can get a job and that's pretty
cool when I started working at
Salesforce three years ago what really
intrigued me about the platform was just
how easy it was to build apps on it you
have a lot of free range as a developer
to build whatever you want with code you
can do so much with just point and click
it's a really interesting platform</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
