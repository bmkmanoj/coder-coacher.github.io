defining the function fill in which
takes an unfilled formula and returns
all the possible filled in formulas so
what do we have to do well let's
consider a formula and I'm going to take
a one that's simpler than one we've seen
before
I'm going to take the formula I plus I
equals me and what we have to do then is
find out what all the letters are in
this formula and fill in all possible
values for digits for those letters so
it seems like a good thing is to collect
all the letters and in this particular
formula the letters should be I M and E
so what are the possible digits that we
want to replace these three letters with
well we can just iterate through all the
three-digit numbers and but make sure
that we're not duplicating any of those
numbers and so maybe we'll start with 1
2 3 then 1 2 4 and so on 1 2 0 and then
1 3 and we wouldn't do 1 3 1 because we
already have a 1 there so 1 3 2 1 3
can't do 1 3 3 so 1 3 4 and so on and so
on we just have all these possibilities
how many possibilities are there
well there's 10 possible first digits
and then we don't want to repeat a digit
so 9 possible second digits and eight
possible third digits so that's 720
possibilities so not very many at all
should be really fast to go through all
these possibilities now what is it what
function gives me all the possible sets
of numbers in order so order matters 1 2
0 for example is different than 0 1 2 or
2 0 1 and so on what function is it that
we give it the list of digits
so we want some function f we give it
the list of digits and we give it the
number that we want and there are three
letters in this particular formula so we
want three of them what function f takes
that and then returns this sequence of
all possible sets of numbers and maybe
it returns it as a tuple or a list or
whatever the question is what function
can do that
is it combinations permutations
factorial or some other function</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
