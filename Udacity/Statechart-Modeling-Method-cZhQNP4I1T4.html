gone through with it with the clock
radio really is a an example of a
process which you could use to do state
chart modeling and here are the here are
the steps that we went through
we prepared use cases to start with of
typical uses of the clock radio we
determined the external perception is
what the user can see or hear or feel
with respect to the device we modeled
those percepts with States which may be
corresponding and currently executing
state machines we determined the
external controls and the stimuli or
actions or user actions that could occur
in doing this we might model with
additional states and/or add in
additional transitions or events then we
began to consider the responses that the
system have and we did this with a table
in which we listed the various events
and the responses of the systems two of
those events we added in some external
internal States or state machines to
handle the timing situation we provided
coordination mechanisms including the
guarded guarded transitions and new
internal events and added any additional
actions and activities that the clock
radio was required to do in order to
implement or implement these particular
responses and then we we validated the
resulting state chart</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
