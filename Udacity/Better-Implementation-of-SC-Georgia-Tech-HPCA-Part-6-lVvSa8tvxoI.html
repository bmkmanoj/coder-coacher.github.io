of sequential consistency in which a
core can reorder loads but this can lead
to violations of sequential consistency
so it has to also detect when sequential
consistency may be violated and fix
things this is of course easy to say but
how do we really do that
so let's look at a program where there
is a load to a and then sometime later
but not too much later a load from B so
we need to make this execute in order if
doing otherwise will violate sequential
consistency but we want to really
execute them out of order if there is no
potential for sequential consistency
violation so let's look at what happens
in the reorder buffer of a processor
that tries to execute this the reorder
buffer keeps instructions in program
order
so the first load will be known to come
ahead of the second load now if we
actually do this access first and this
second then there is no potential for
violating sequential consistency because
we are actually doing whatever the
simple implementation would do anyway so
the sequential consistency violation can
occur when we first do load be in a real
execution order and later for example
because the computation for address of a
has been delayed we do load of a now the
important thing to note is that this is
not necessarily a violation of
sequential consistency if nobody writes
either B or a during this time then the
B here and the a here will be the same
as if we reorder them back to their
original program order so we are getting
the same value of B no matter where we
load it if nobody writes anything in
fact for this to actually be a violation
of synchronization C like we can
actually get a different value for B
then we could in sequential consistency
what has to happen is that there is at
least one store to be between the time
we actually read B and the time
we should have read be according to
sequential consistency why well because
if we don't have the store here then the
value we read here is the same as the
value that we would have read here where
it would be okay to read B so now you
can see how we can detect violations of
sequential consistency when we read
something ahead of program order we need
to start monitoring the coherence
traffic produced by other processors so
if we see such a store then this load
and anything that it fed the data to
must be replayed note that this load is
replayable because in the Rob is here we
are assuming that this load still hasn't
happened which means that the commit
pointer for the Rob is somewhere here or
maybe add the load here but definitely
the load from B has not been committed
so we are capable of replaying it in the
worst case we can just cancel this load
and anything that follows and just
refresh those instructions so we know
how to undo the damage here but in order
to detect the violation now we have to
basically anything that we load out of
order we need to monitor coherence
traffic until that load becomes in order</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
