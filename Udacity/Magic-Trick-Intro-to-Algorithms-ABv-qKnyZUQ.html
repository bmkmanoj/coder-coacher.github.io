is michael Lippmann and I'm going to be
the instructor let's start off with a
little magic trick
alright here is a collection of actors
from movies this is Bruce Willis Danny
DeVito Cloris Leachman Stanley Tucci Tom
Hanks Haley Joel Osment and Robin
Williams I'm going to connect together
actors who were in movies together with
lines that represent those movies so
Bruce Willis and Tom Hanks were in a
movie together called pond fire the
vanities that seemed like it was going
to be very good but it was not Bruce
Willis and Cloris Leachman were in a
movie together called beavis and
butt-head do America also not a very
popular movie Tom Hanks and Stanley
Tucci we're in a movie called the
terminal haley joel osment and Bruce
Willis were in The Sixth Sense
they were the stars of that movie I will
not tell you the ending but Haley Joel
Osment was also in Forrest Gump with Tom
Hanks Robin Williams and Stanley Tucci
were in a movie called deconstructing
Harry Cloris Leachman at Stanley Tucci
were in a movie called gambit Danny
DeVito and Robin Williams were in death
to smoochy
alright next I'm going to connect Bruce
Willis and Danny DeVito who were in a
movie together called
I'm still here and lastly I'm going to
connect Bruce Willis and Stanley Tucci
who were in a movie called Billy
Bathgate alright now that we have the
diagram I'm going to start off with one
of the actors let's say Bruce Willis and
I'm going to move around on this
structure visiting all the movies
exactly once and so let's see how that
goes so there's lots of different
choices to start off that say I'm going
to go from Bruce Willis to Tom Hanks Tom
Hanks to Stanley Tucci Stanley Tucci
back to Bruce Willis Bruce Willis to
Cloris Leachman to Stanley Tucci again
to Robin Williams to Danny DeVito to
Bruce Willis to Haley Joel Osment and
then to Tom Hanks and now you can see
that I visited all of the movies exactly
once and I ended up at Tom Hanks alright
so let's try this again with a different
set of actors now we've got Susan
Sarandon Dustin Hoffman Julia Roberts
Kevin Bacon Robert De Niro
and Hathaway and Merrill Street and
we're going to put in some of their
movies again Robert De Niro and Dustin
Hoffman we're in a movie together called
wag the dog Robert De Niro and Meryl
Streep we're in a movie together called
Marvin's Room Dustin Hoffman and Susan
Sarandon were in a movie together called
midnight mile Dustin Hoffman and Julia
Roberts we're in a movie together called
Hook Dustin Hoffman and Kevin Bacon were
in a movie together called sleepers
Susan Sarandon and Julia Roberts were in
a movie together called step-mom Kevin
Bacon and Julia Roberts were in
Flatliners might be able to tell from
some of the movies and the actors that I
picked that I watched more movies in the
80s and I watched now Meryl Streep and
Kevin Bacon we're in a movie together
called the river wild Meryl Streep and
Anne Hathaway we're in The Devil Wears
Prada together and Anne Hathaway and
Julia Roberts were in Valentines Day
we're going to do this as a little bit
of a quiz so I'm going to mark each of
these edges as something that you need
to visit and you need to visit all of
them and I strongly suggest that you
actually check them off as you go
because it's really easy to do one twice
or forget one by accident so this is
what I want you to do I want you to go
through and start at Meryl Streep and
move along the green lines here at the
movies and each time you visit a movie
check it off as you go so the right
answer in this quiz is to have all the
edges checked off and none of them
checked off twice it's really easy to
mess that up so be very careful and then
when you're done I want you to mark the
little bubble corresponding to which
actor you end up with at the end of your
path you can follow any path that you
want you just have to make sure that you
visit each of the movies once all right
I'd like you to actually go and do this
and check off the actor that you end up
with</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
