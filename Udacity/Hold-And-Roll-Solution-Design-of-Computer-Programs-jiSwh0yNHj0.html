just broke it up into pieces so I know
what I'm talking about and then if I
hold it becomes the other players turn
the other players score score is the
same as the head was before so now
remember the second place is the score
of the player whose turn it is so that
was you previously and then the score
that I got I just add in the pending I
reap all of those and the pending gets
reset to zero when I roll again let's
figure out what's in the state if the
roll is one that's a pig out becomes the
other players turn and I only got one
lousy point pending gets reset to zero
if the roll is not a one then it's still
my turn I don't change my score so far
but I add D on to the pending and here's
just a way to map from one player to the
other the other player if it was one
becomes 0 and if it was 0 becomes one
and it's always a great idea to write
some test cases now one comment on style
right here i'm taking this state which
is a tuple that has four components and
I'm breaking it up like this into its
four components and when you have four
components that's probably ok but it's
it's getting to worry me a little bit
that maybe I won't be able to remember
which part of the state is which if I
had more than four if I had five or six
components I really start to worry about
that so there are other possibilities
where we can be more explicit about what
the state is rather than just have it be
a set of undifferentiated elements of a
tuple that we then define like this we
can define it ahead of time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
