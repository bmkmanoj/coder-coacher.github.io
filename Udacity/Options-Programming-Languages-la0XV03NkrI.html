expressions to choose either A or B
another very common choice is to choose
between a or nothing that is to have a
part of a string that's optional for
example when you're writing out numbers
it's possible to put a negative sign at
the beginning of a number but you don't
need to depends on which number you're
trying to get across here I've drawn a
finite state machine that accepts
numbers with no leading negative sign
and numbers with leading negative sign
let's see how it goes for something like
1 2 3 we start here 1 2 3 and we're in
state for which accepts for something
like negative 57 negative 57 we're in
state 3 which accepts but you may have
noticed quite a bit of duplication in
this finite state machine these two red
areas are the same it's an edge labeled
zero through nine an accepting state
with a self loof labeled zero through
nine and one of the things we really
wanted was to be concise so conceptually
it might be simpler to have an edge that
somehow consumes no input this new
finite state machine will have still
except one two three here we start in
state 1 I don't consume anything and
move to state 2 and then it's one two
three and we accept negative 57 take the
negative 57 and then we accept we have a
particular convention for indicating
that an edge accepts no input we use the
Greek letter Epsilon you can either
think of epsilon is meaning consume no
input when you go across this edge or
you can think of it as referring to the
empty string at which point you can
consume the empty string all you want
but since it's of size 0 it doesn't
affect what you're trying to recognize
this idea of using this Greek letter
this is totally arbitrary this is just
an artificial convention but it's a
commonly used one so it's worth knowing
continuing our theme that anything that
can be done in finite state machines can
be done in regular expressions and vice
versa we'll firm that up later on I'm
going to give you a new regular
expression the question mark which we
typically read as optional or the
previous thing 0 or 1 times in that way
it's a lot like plus which was the
previous thing one or more times
so I might write a regular expression
that accepts numbers that may optionally
have a leading negative sign this
negative sign may be present one time or
zero times it can be there or not we
definitely need the zero through nine
plus and the string we're looking for
this needle in is 1861 to 1941 our
Tagore and on this particular input we
will find two substrings that match 1861
matches without the leading negative
sign and hyphen 1941 matches with the
leading negative sign rabindranath
tagore is a Nobel Prize winning bengali
poet perhaps best known for his work
where the mind is without fear</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
