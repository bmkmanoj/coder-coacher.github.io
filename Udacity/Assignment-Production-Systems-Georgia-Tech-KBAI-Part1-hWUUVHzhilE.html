design an agent that can solve Ravens
progressive matrices we can think about
this kind of at two different levels at
one level we can imagine a production
system that's able to address any
incoming problem it has a set of rules
for what to look for in a new problem
and it knows how to reply when it finds
those things but on the other hand we
can also imagine production rules that
are specific to a given problem when the
agent receives a new problem it induces
some production rules that govern the
transformation between certain figures
and in transfers that to other rows and
columns so in that way it's able to use
that same kind of production system
methodology to answer these problems
even though it doesn't come into the
problem with any production rules
written in advance so inherent in this
idea though is the idea of learning from
the problem that it receives how is this
learning going to take place how is it
actually going to write these production
rules based on a new problem and what's
the benefit of doing it this way what do
we get out of actually having these
production rules that are written based
on individual problems</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
