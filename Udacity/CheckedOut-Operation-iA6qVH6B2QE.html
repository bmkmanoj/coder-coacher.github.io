if we are trying to come up with a
constraint for this operation what's its
context it is the patron class so it's
in the patron class with constraints
that talk about operations we can go a
step further and say which operation so
so we're going we're going to
essentially have patron and in this case
there's going to be double colon
separating patron from the name of the
particular operation okay and we're
allowed to go one step further and
actually have the signature there ok now
the signature was expressed within the
just the UML diagram part of things so
to fill in this part of the constraint
we're going to say context we're going
to have a patron colon colon and then
the items currently checked out and in
this case there's no arguments or at
least there's no explicit argument in
object oriented languages there's always
an implicit argument of the object
receiving the request so the patron
itself so the patron itself is an
argument and we're going to qualify with
respect to it and and so there's no
explicit argument listed in the
signature however there is a return
value given the diagram what would you
think would be the type of the return
value of this checked out operation it
would be a loanable item so ok but the
requirement says the loanable items
plural ok ok yeah so a list or some
group of vulnerable items association
becomes when you actually program it us
ok so we in this case because of it with
there's a plural in the expression of
things we know there's going to be more
than one and ocl provides us various
what it calls collection classes ways of
organizing things and it's important in
deciding exactly which collection class
to use to think about the
properties that are required so now use
the word lists and lists tends to have
an order in this case do we care about
the order not particularly out okay so
what other data structure is is a
collection class but doesn't care about
order a set or an array or so ocl does
have a set operation so in this case the
return value for this operation is a set
of loanable items okay is it okay
because when you use the word set it
makes me think that you're implying we
could only check out one of a certain
type of book which may be a requirement
but I don't think that was explicit and
requirements statement you can check out
the same like multiple copies of the
same book at you there's nothing about
either the requirements or this this ocl
that prevents you from checking out
multiple copies of the same book because
each of those is going to be a separate
loanable item ok so what it is
preventing you from doing is checking
out the same book twice at the same time
right that's what I mean right so we
can't do that even is that is that
specified in the requirements or is that
just something we're now okay so great
point and so we call one of the one of
the subtleties of the original
requirements analysis I had to do with
what happens if you check out a book
hold it over do you have money due on it
you returned it so it's not accruing any
extra okay as far as the fine is
concerned but the system has to remember
that right so in a sense that checked
out record has to still be there okay to
hold that information now what happens
if you try to check it out again okay if
we use a set here we run the risk of
clobbering that the record and and
breaking things so I think you've
pointed out a place where we have to be
very very careful about doing this right
and in this case it looks like yes we
would clobber things in that particular
situation
for operations that we're trying to
model in OC l the next question
typically is what are the preconditions
and that means the circumstances under
which it is meaningful for the operation
to execute in the case of items
currently checked out as with most
operations that provide a value without
affecting any change in state there are
no preconditions in OC l we have two
ways of dealing with that we could have
a precondition which has the value the
boolean value true which says it always
is the case that it's okay to run this
operation or we can leave out the
precondition entirely which which has
the same same implications and so for
readability purposes you may want to do
that to make they make the overall
constraint a little shorter the third
part in specifying operations is to
specify which value is returned by the
operation to compute the items that are
currently checked out we merely navigate
along the checked out association to the
corresponding loanable items so here's
what the overall constraint looks like
we have the context which had our
signature and then we had a post
condition now the postcondition lists
another ocl keyword which is result and
that stands in for or whatever it is
that's computed by that operation and
what's what needs to be computed in this
case is those links in the checked out
association which correspond to you know
items checked out by this particular
patron now we already are restricted by
our context to just the patron of
interest for the query and that patron
is then going to be a partner in certain
of the links in the association and we
want to get the partners of the other
end the loanable items that belong to
that patron so we navigate from patron
which is our context through checked out
to loanable item and
that will be the set of loanable items
that are currently associated with that
that patron and it once again leaves us
in the situation where what has checked
out mean okay it means either you
currently have them checked out and
haven't returned them or you check them
out you held them too long you return
them and the system is remembering that
you still owe something on them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
