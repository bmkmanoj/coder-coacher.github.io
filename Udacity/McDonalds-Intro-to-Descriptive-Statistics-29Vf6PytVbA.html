the McDonald's they've never gone to war
with each other no no I didn't know that
yeah because everyone's way too lazy
after they get fat China and the US
haven't gone to war because there's a
McDonald's at China and then there's
McDonald's here really no I didn't know
that through countries yeah did you know
no I didn't know that wouldn't surprise
me is that really true it's true nobody
had heard of the golden arches theory of
conflict prevention before but I put
them on the spot and asked them for a
possible explanation why do you think
that is because that good food tastes
good once you have a McDonald's in your
country your motivation just goes way
down have a McDonald you've reached a
certain status I guess and that makes
you more first-world I don't know maybe
countries that bring in McDonald's
accept Americans a little more freely
this correlation between McDonald's and
peace can lead to some interesting
policy conclusions so I asked another
question so do you think that if every
country in the world how to McDonald's
there'd be world peace absolutely not I
don't think so because that's different
different different ways they everybody
think I wish everybody agreed to do it
but I don't think so I'm skeptical that
it's true actually it's called the
golden arches theory of conflict
resolution okay
correlation does not mean causation
words of wisdom that would be nice
wouldn't it yes go to McDonald to get
that Big Mac yeah that's small on your
face you don't think about anything
McDonald's originated here right so I
mean I just don't think it's in their
best interest to be putting up
McDonald's --is in places that they're
at war with I mean that it stretches so
far there's no way to correlate the data
I think there probably is something
we're driving the console
then not having a McDonald</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
