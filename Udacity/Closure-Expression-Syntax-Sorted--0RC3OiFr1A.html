function called sort which is a part of
the sequence type protocol this function
can be called by any type that conforms
to the sequence type protocol often an
array or a dictionary the sort function
takes one argument a closure expression
indicating how the items in a collection
should be sorted in the end the function
returns a sorted array for example let's
imagine we're at a silent auction and we
have an array of bids that we'd like to
sort from lowest to highest here's our
array of bids along with an array for
the return value called ordered bids the
bids array will call the sort method and
that's where the closure expression
comes in closure expressions typically
take the form in between curly braces
first you'll see the parameters being
passed in followed by an arrow pointing
to the return type similar to what you'd
see in a function signature then the
return type is followed by the word in
and then the statements to be executed
back up here and the closure we're
passing into the sort function notice
that there is no name we skip straight
to the curly braces in between curly
braces first we write the parameters
being passed in which are intz we're
passing in two intz from the array each
time sort always takes two parameters
that match the type of the array calling
the function after the parameters we see
an arrow pointing to the return type the
return type here is a bull indicating
whether bid one should be placed before
bid two or not next comes the word in
signalling the beginning of the
executable statements and then the
executable statement in this case is
very short it's just bid 2 is greater
than bid 1 if bid 2 is greater than bid
1 then bid 1 should go first in the
sorted array if we print out the results
the ordered bids array we can see that
the bids are an order from lowest to
highest let's alter the example just a
bit and say that the auction goers put
in more exact bids they put their bids
in as doubles how would our closure
expression change in this case since the
parameters are now doubles we'll need to
change the parameter types of bid 1 and
bid 2 but notice that the return type
and the sort
stateman both remain the same let's do
one more example for good measure let's
say we're sorting an array of birth
years and we want to put the years in
reverse chronological order what should
our closure expression look like what
should be placed between curly braces
here like before we're sorting an array
events which means that the two
parameters passed into the closure
expression will also be int let's call
those parameters year 1 and year 2 next
comes an arrow pointing to the return
type and remember that sort always takes
a closure with the same return type and
that return type is a bowl next comes
the word in to signal the beginning of
the closures executable statements and
since we want the birth years in reverse
chronological order
that means the bull should return true
if your 1 is greater than year 2 and
over here in the side bar we can see our
sorted array even though in this case
the array is sorted essentially
instantaneously you can see that the
closure represents a passing of the flow
of control it's as if we're saying here
sort take this chunk of code and use it
when you need it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
