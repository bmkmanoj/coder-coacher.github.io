hard time finding a new home you see I'd
like to be in a very specific area and
it would be awesome I could tell the
site which blocks I want and which
blocks I do not want but I'm left having
to go through them one by one oh that
sounds really frustrating why don't you
try using my listing site you see in my
site you can draw the exact area that
you want to live within and only search
for listings within that area you can
leave out the shady parts in the
neighborhood really wow thanks I'll be
sure to check it out let's dive back
into the JavaScript API and learn how to
put such a dope feature into our site
remember that libraries parameter we
added earlier into our call to load the
API we're going to load the geometry
library when we load the API by using
the library's parameter yep that so a
lot like a physical library the Maps
JavaScript API libraries are full of
useful things but they're only useful
when you use them and they take up extra
space if you don't like all of your
cookbooks it would be a lot better not
to have them sitting around if you're
just going to get takeout with the Maps
API libraries you only load what you
need so we already have the geometry
library loaded which allowed us to use
that cool spherical calculation to get
the heading for our street view image
the geometry library is all about making
it easier to do complicated calculations
in the mapping space essentially it
allows you to skip the map and let
Google do the work for you when trying
to translate our 3d world into the 2d
mapping space there's also the
visualization library which it allows
you to use your data set to create heat
maps or other representations of data
concentration read through the next
section to learn more about those two
libraries</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
