common thing that everyone engages in
and what I'm talking about fantasy it
doesn't necessarily just have to be
erotic or sexual fantasy a lot of people
daydream or fantasize about multiple
things throughout the day so maybe the
perfect job that they want or maybe like
a certain house or maybe the latest you
know iPhone or whatever the situation
may be
and so it's completely natural that
people might fantasize about sex or
erotic touch or just liking someone and
being with them in fact in some recent
studies 93 percent of men and 86 percent
of women reported that they do engage in
in fantasy it can be really helpful for
individuals to be engaging in fantasy
type thoughts on their own as long as
again they've got some cognitive kind of
restructuring that they've done if they
have any walls or blockades around sex
or sexuality so that they aren't kind of
beating themself up later for
fantasizing so as long as they know that
it's okay and they're comfortable doing
that
then it's fine couples also can engage
in fantasy together so they can tell
each other their fantasies tell each
other their desires and it doesn't
necessarily mean that they have to act
on those as a couple or as individuals
fantasy is in its definition a fantasy
which often times as things that we
might not do or maybe that we have done
and we're just thinking about in
hindsight and as long as it's done in a
way that is healthy for the individual
healthy for the couple then absolutely
it's totally natural normal healthy and
nothing wrong with it but what age is it
possible for people to reach orgasm men
and women it's a great question so I
hear this question a lot you know when
when can people orgasm when can they
kind of experience sexually you know
positive feelings and so what's really
interesting is there are images of
infants in utero particularly male
infants or infants with penises we don't
really know their gender yet but there
are images of them in utero touching
their penises fondling them so
so one of the things that the texts that
look at ultrasounds in the medical field
will tell you is that oftentimes it's
it's hard to identify male infants
because their hands are usually in
between their legs so much in utero that
they never actually are able to see the
famous and so although we can't be
certain because certainly there is no
way to get inside the mind of an infant
or even really ask them any questions
there's pretty good literature to
support that both babies that happen to
be male and babies that happen to be
female are experiencing sexual feelings
orgasmic type feelings when when they're
touching their genitalia which is a
totally natural and normal thing even
for small infants and toddlers to engage
in now are we talking about you know an
orgasm where a male actually like
ejaculate swell no certainly not an
infancy that doesn't happen until males
tend to be like 12 13 years old but if
we're talking about orgasmic feelings
there's there's actually we don't really
know exactly when that starts it's it
says young as the person you know
becomes curious about their own body and
starts it's fluorine so</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
