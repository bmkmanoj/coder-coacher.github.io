at which the data arrives ready to be
processed we need to be able to accept
and store that data even when it's
coming in at a rate of terabytes per day
if we can't store it as it arrives we'll
end up discarding some of it and that's
what we want to avoid think about an
e-commerce website if we knew what
products you've looked at in the past we
could recommend similar products the
next time you visit our site if you've
spent five minutes looking at a
particular item we could maybe send you
an email informing you the product is on
sale if we know that you typically
browse our site using a first generation
iPad we could suggest the latest model
this is a huge difference to what we
could do before when we only stored the
records of the actual purchases if we
can store and process all of our web
server logs along with the purchase data
that's in our traditional data warehouse
we could give the customer a much better
shopping experience which would directly
translate into bigger profits yet
another example is a movie site like
Netflix based on what they know about
your viewing habits they can recommend
movies to you as you can see here
because of what IANS rated highly before
this movie is recommended to him and
they can even predict what rating he
would give this movie</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
