to check and see or to enumerate strings
in this language so that we can check
strings for validity so here I've
written the grammar but it's on kind of
a pencil and paper format with these
arrows and whatnot I'm going to need to
encode it so that Python can understand
it just like we had to encode the edges
in our finite state machine so that
Python could understand them so here on
the right I've written a potential
Python encoding for this grammar
expression goes to expression plus
expression the way I'm going to encode
this is if we had a goes to B C I'm
going to make that the rule a goes to B
C so we've got the left hand side and
the right hand side left hand side in
the right hand side so expression goes
to expression plus expression expression
can also go to expression minus
expression or expression in parentheses
or just number and here I'm writing all
of my terminals and non terminals as
strings just to make it quality checking
easier so then given a seed utterance
like print expression followed by
semicolon we would represent that as a
list of three strings and what I want to
do is take our grammar rules like this
one and our utterances like this one and
combine them together to get I've
replaced the expression that was already
in here using this rule I've replaced it
with expression minus expression well if
I've stored this in a Python variable
called utterance and the position I want
to change is position one that's where
I'm going to apply this rule I can get
out this core result with with this
Python that uses list selection
utterance from 0 up to but not including
pause this part here corresponds to this
part in our example the word print
something that came before the part we
were interested in the right hand side
of the rule was expression minus
expression and then the rest of the
utterance this semicolon something else
we weren't concerned with this time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
