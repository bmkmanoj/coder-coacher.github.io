height reduction quiz we had this code
and we are trying to transform it
through tree height reduction into
something that minimizes the overall
number of cycles it takes to execute
this code here the code takes six cycles
to do because each of the instructions
depends on the previous one now when
doing tree height reduction what we need
to do is really figure out what is the
expression that this is trying to
compute and then rewrite that expression
so here's what we have here we have r1
plus r2 put the result in our 10 then
subtract r3 then either for death
subtract r5 then add r6 then subtract r7
so this is what we are trying to compute
how do we compute it with tree height
reduction well the idea is to compute r1
and r2
that's what we are doing here and then
compute the rest of the things and then
add them up in a tree so here what we
need to do is we need to add up four
numbers and then subtract three numbers
from that so first we will add up the
four numbers
we already added up r1 and r2 now we're
gonna add up our 4 in our six next the
result of the two additions are gonna be
combined so we are going to add up what
we have for r1 and r2 and what we have
for our 4 in r6 so now in our 10 we have
the r1 plus r2 plus r4 plus r6 now we're
going to subtract r3 r5 and our 7 from
it if we do it one at a time that's
going to be slow so what we're going to
do is we're going to add up r3 r5 and
our 7 and then subtract that from our
our 10 that's why we have to adds here
so clearly what we are doing here is we
are simply adding up r3 r5 and then r7
is added to that so this needs to be our
11 so now our 11 has r3 plus or 5 plus R
7 and now we subtract that from
r10 and we get the final answer in our
10 now let us see how many cycles we
need to do this to do that let's draw
the dependencies here we had a
dependence again like this so each
instruction needed to be done right
after the previous one is done here
there is no dependence between these two
there is a dependence here and here so
the third instruction needs to wait for
the first two to complete there is now
no dependence here so this one can be
done right away even though it's the
fourth instruction in our code and then
there is a dependence here and then
finally there is a dependence here and
also our final our ten here needs to be
brought this way so if you look at what
can be done in the first cycle this can
be done in the first cycle and soak in
this this cannot because it has to wait
this can so this is also done in the
first cycle and then this has to wait
for that and so on so in our first cycle
we've already done three instruction
half of the instructions that we had in
the second cycle we can do this because
these two complete in the first cycle we
can do this because it only waits for
this and that's been done and finally in
the third cycle we have to do this
because it has to wait for the results
of the second cycle so we have completed
our six instructions now in three cycles
and we got an LP of two which is twice
as good as we had before the tree height
reduction</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
