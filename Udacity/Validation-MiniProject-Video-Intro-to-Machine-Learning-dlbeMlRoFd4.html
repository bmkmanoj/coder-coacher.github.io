building a supervised classification
algorithm that can tell based on our
Enron data set who at Enron was a
suspected person of interest in the
fraud case that happened when the
company went bankrupt in this mini
project you're actually going to build
your first iteration of this person of
interest identifier so the first thing
we'll be building a sort of Minimum
Viable Product we're not expecting it to
be really great we're not expecting it
to be really optimized but you'll have
something up and running in the first
part of this mini project in the second
part of the mini project we're going to
wrap this in a training testing
framework so that from this point
forward when you go in and you compute
the accuracy of your person of interest
identifier you have it all set up
properly so that it's it's computing
that accuracy on the test set like it
should be and then from this point
forward once you have this code set up
your job is just going to be then to
fill in all the features that you want
to use or do any transforms things like
that so let's get started on building
that code framework</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
