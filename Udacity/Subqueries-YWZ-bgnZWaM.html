many people when they learn SQL so far
whenever you've done a select you've
selected from either a table or a few
join two tables there's another thing
you can select from as well namely the
results of a select query this is one
form of something called a sub query or
sometimes a sub select remember back in
Lesson one when I mentioned that the
result of a query is always a table this
is why since the result of a query is a
table you can select from it join it
aggregate it and so on here's a table
that lists moose ball players and what
team they're on and the number of points
they scored in the last season and
here's a query that will find the
highest-scoring players score for each
team this uses the max aggregation
grouping by team to find the highest
score but suppose that we want to know
what the average score of a highest
score is to do this we can take this
whole query and stick it inside of
another query the outside query gives
the average of the inside queries
results the syntax of SQL requires that
we give the sub query result table a
name maxes here even though we don't
actually use that word anyplace in the
query it's just required</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
