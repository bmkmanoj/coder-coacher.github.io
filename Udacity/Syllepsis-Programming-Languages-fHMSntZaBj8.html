there's a particular form of word play
called celeb sis based on exploiting
this semantic incongruity let me give
you an example of what it looks like in
natural language and then we'll bring it
back to HTML in this fragment she made
no reply up her mind and a dash for the
door made is being applied to three
different things
replies make up a mind and make a dash
for some location and it means something
slightly different in each of these
making a reply means to speak making up
your mind means to decide something and
making a dash for the door means to run
for the exit but because we have this
one function if you'll permit me being
applied to these sort of three different
types of arguments there's an
incongruity which some may find humorous
here's perhaps my favorite example from
the same source she lowered her
standards by raising her glass her
courage her eyes and his hopes this is a
very good but very disconcerting poem
and a very lovely example of celeb --ss
lowered is being applied to standards
that means to give up your ideals or try
something worse raising her glass as if
in a toast raising her courage to muster
up her willpower raising her eyes to
look up at someone and raising his hopes
because well nothing good happens in
this bone similarly there's an error in
HTML known as mismatched tags we talked
about balance parentheses in parsing the
same number of a's followed by the same
number of B's or the same number of open
parentheses followed by the same number
of closed parentheses recall that that's
not something that we can do with
regular languages or regular expressions
but we can capture it with a
context-free grammar however we didn't
handle it in our parser so we must
handle it now this concept is not
particularly tricky but it does require
a context-free grammar so just to make
sure that we're all on the same page
there's a bit of a quiz I have written
three HTML fragments but I've left some
things blank what I would like you to do
is fill in each blank with the word
necessary for each fragment alone to be
well balanced HTML to have its
eggs match up perfectly</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
