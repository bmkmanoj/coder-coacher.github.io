of y equals negative 18 times X minus 4
times X minus 24 at this time I've
graphed a graph that looks pretty
similar to that I just change this to a
28 instead anyway I'd like you to
inspect this graph that we have now now
while you're looking at this graph I'd
like you to think back to the first
parabola we dealt with in this lesson y
equals negative x squared over 8 plus 4x
minus 14 remember this was the curve
that we were using to describe how the
ball would fly out of the slingshot and
go through the hoop it grants display
booths for this quadratic equation we
found its y-intercept its x intercepts
and its maximum as these points right
here take a second and compare these
points to this graph and then think
about how these equations might be
connected here are a few different
options for how these two equations
might be connected to one another and
I'd like you to pick all of the ones
that apply is there no connection
between them at all do their graphs to
share a few points so their graphs go
through all of the same points do they
graph the same curve or are the
equations equivalent to one another</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
