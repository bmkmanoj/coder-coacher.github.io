and we're tackling the problem of blank
tiles and you probably thought this was
coming we talked about blank tiles as we
were trying to design the program and if
you remember back to playing poker I
through the problem of Joker's at you so
blank tiles are similar to Joker's they
can be played and any letter can take
the place of the blank tile so you get
to choose which letter you want to
replace this with but we can't use
exactly the approach that we used with
Joker's of saying well let's just try
all 26 possibilities one at a time
without changing the code and then just
take the maximum play over those say
because the scoring rules are different
now suppose we wanted to play the word
sway we could use the the blank tile to
form a why but if we had a real why tile
that would be worth four points whereas
if we have a blank white Isle that's
where zero points in terms of the letter
score so we can't just replace it as is
we have to keep track of the scoring so
we have a question of how we're going to
represent the planks now I'm going to
make some of that choice for you I'm
going to say that in the hand which is a
string of seven characters the blank
tile is going to be represented by an
underscore and on the board when you
finally decide what you're going to play
let's say you decide that the blanks
going to rip you represented by a why
we're going to go ahead and represent
that as a capital letter Y because once
it's played it fully takes on the effect
of the letter it replaces so somewhere
from going to the hand to going from the
board the blank changes from underscore
to a capitalized letter but in between
it's up to you now as the program
progresses we call best play which calls
all plays and some point we're going to
call calculate score it's up to you to
decide what format and what type of data
you want to pass to each of those
functions so one possibility is you can
maintain the underscore as a
representation for a blank at some point
you might want to swap over and use the
capital letter that you've chosen to
replace it with you also have the option
of using a lower
case letter and that has the advantage
of one it tells you what letter I've
chosen but also it distinguishes the
lowercase letter which represents a
blank and would score 0 from the
uppercase letter which does not
represent a blank and would score for so
you decide which combinations of these
you want and which functions you have to
modify in order to successfully make the
best play the best choice for using a
blank or not using it if the best play
is to not use a blank in your hand to
score the maximum number of points and
here are some examples here's the
directions for what you should do assume
that all the code is is loaded and just
write the functions and maybe updates to
variables that you need and then make
sure you can pass at least these tests
and but you probably should try out some
additional tests of your own so make
sure that you haven't broken best play
and that it still gets the same result
for the test that we did before when one
letters is a blank you actually score a
little bit less because the a score is
no letter points now I've chosen to show
here the lowercase letter to indicate
where the blank is is played but your
function that returns best played
doesn't necessarily have to return it a
representation like that it could could
have returned the blank character there
or something as long as we know that the
score is correct in the play the best
play is correct when there's two blanks
we could have scored we could have
continued to create back bench with two
blanks in it but it turns out that
another play making kick and taking
advantage of some triple bonuses scores
higher</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
