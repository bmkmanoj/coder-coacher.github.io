about kind of the the basic approaches
to scaling we said the first one was
optimize the code and when we're talking
about a database we're probably not
optimizing code but this this with this
stage of thinking means you know have
the appropriate indexes you know make
sure the query is saying you know make
sure you're only querying for things
that you actually need at the queries
simple you know those types of things
we're not we're not going to do that
here because our query is actually very
simple and google app engine makes our
indices for us but this is always the
first thing you want to check if the
index app engine makes is an optimal for
the query you're running you may have to
make something by hand you know so you
should you should always start here you
know the first step is limit the work
the database needs to do in the worst
case let's assume we've already done
that because we have for ASCII Chan
something else we talked about was
adding more machines we don't really
have control over that in this
particular situation App Engine manages
that for us if you're not using App
Engine maybe you need to add more
machines maybe you need to start doing
replication or sharding or those
techniques now if you've ever tried to
do those techniques on your own you know
that they're very difficult they're very
complex and this is usually adding more
machines when you're talking about a
database is kind of the last resort for
scaling something else we talked about
was using bigger machines again we don't
have a whole lot of control over that on
App Engine I think you can upgrade
machines a little bit but you know let's
let's say we're done messing with that
or maybe we're tired of paying for
database queries and we just want to get
to the fun part the what we're gonna
spend this lecture talking about which
is cashing a very simple thing we can do
after we've optimized the database and
we don't want to fiddle with more system
ministration is cash this query you know
an ASCII Chan the front page of ASCII
Chan only changes when somebody submits
so that means it's a good opportunity to
cash what we actually store and that is
what I'm going to do right now is add a
little bit of caching to ask you Jan ok
you all remember ask your chin it's
online at ASCII Chan com you remember
how it works we can type in a title and
then we can draw some ascii art or in my
case paste it and when you submit the
art you see a listing of all the
previous arts submitted to ASCII Chan
the way this works on the code when you
do a get on ASCII Chan we call this
function called render front which is
defined here ok so let's render front
function basically what it does
it runs this data store query written in
G equal that looks up the 10 most recent
pieces of art so limit 10 that's how we
know we're looking up 10 order by
created descending so that orders them
by the time they're created this where
ancestor equals art key is a data store
technique for basically ensuring that
your query is consistent I kind of want
to talk about that in unit 3 but things
seem to be getting a little complex if
you read the data store docs you'll and
kind of search for the word consistent
you'll see what this technique is
referring to so anyway not super
important for our purposes but just so
you know why that's there it's not
required if I got rid of this at our
scale the site would be behave exactly
the same so then what we do is we
actually run that query remember this
just defines the query when you iterate
over the query or in my case turn it
into a list that's when you actually go
to the database and and get the results
back remember I turn it into a list here
so that I don't accidentally run the
query twice when I ate over it again
here and then again when we actually
render the page I just want to run the
query once so what we want to do is cash
this query because our front page isn't
going to change very often most users
come to ASCII Chan and just look at the
front page we don't need to hit the
database over and over and over again
every time a user does that that's just
going to you know cost us money waste
you know waste Google's resources and
generally just make the world a worse
place so first thing I'm going to do is
I'm going to pull out this piece of code
into its own function so it's a little
bit easier to manage okay i'm going to
call this function top arts it's not
going to take any parameters because
we're just returning we know what the
query is going to be the query is going
to be the same every time okay so all
i've done is i created this function top
arts and i copy this code actually i cut
this code from render front and moved it
into this function and then we you know
we make the query we run the query and
then we return the result and then in
render front we just call the top arts
function so everything should behave as
it did before we can go ahead and give
that a test here's our front page with
our art and if i were to reload this
page we see that nothing's changed so
nothing big there we didn't expect
anything to change and nothing good okay
so let's go back to the code and start
making our improvements now one thing
we're going to
to do is we want to have a way of
telling ourselves when we're actually
running this query so we can actually
test to make sure our code is working
now I'm not a Google App Engine Pro but
I'm going to add a little statement like
this logging dot error we're just going
to say this DB query and this will print
out in our error console the string DB
query now normally you should use
logging back the bug for this purpose
but the debug mode and App Engine is
driving me nuts right now so this will
be a little bit easier for me to
demonstrate I'm going to have to also
import the logging module for this to
work I'll go ahead and do that just
import logging so this should print in
the console every time we run a DB query
and let's see if that works so here is
ASCII Chan and I'm going to hit reload
on this page and then I'm going to go to
the terminal and we can see that I
printing error DB query that's my string
and then we can also see that the
browser fetched / which is the actual
request to ASCII Chan and also request
favicon which since I haven't created it
just 40 fours so now we have this
printing and we can see that every time
I reload the page in the browser we get
these lines again and I see the the
words DB query right before the request
what we want to do is we want to get rid
of these words without just commenting
out the logging statement okay so let's
add some caching and we're going to use
the same algorithm we used on that quiz
that you guys just implemented we're
going to create a a dictionary and we're
going to call it cash now we have to
have a key to cash I usually like to
store my keys in a variable in this case
I'm just going to call the key top this
is how we're going to store the how
we're going to reference the result of
this query in our cash and then we're
just going to change we're just going to
rewrite this function to use the caching
algorithm so if key in cash arts equals
cache key else we want to run our query
so we run our query in the else
statement and of course we want to store
the result of our query in the cache and
then we return our arts okay so pretty
simple change now we're cashing result
of this one query let's see if it works
we go to our browser I hit reload page
loads with no errors so that's good and
then I go to my console and I see that
it printed out DB query and has the
results now if i were to reload this
page again again no error and i go back
to the console and i can see that we
made a second request
it is get / but this time there's no DB
query so if I were to go to our front
page and hit reload trust me that I'm
doing it you can kind of see a blinking
a little bit over and over again and
then I go back to the console we can see
a bunch of requests but no DB queries
that's pretty cool huh so now our front
page is a lot faster let's submit a new
piece of art to ask you can hear or at
least my local ASCII Chan this is going
to be a pitcher of beer looks like it's
from hofbrauhaus I click Submit huh my
beer did not appear I still have my
original art from before what do you
think happened</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
