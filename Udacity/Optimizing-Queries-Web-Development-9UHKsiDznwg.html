about kind of the the basic approaches
to scaling we said the first one was
optimize the code and when we're talking
about database we're probably not
optimizing code but this this what this
stage of thinking means you know have
the appropriate indexes you know make
sure the query is saying you know make
sure you're only querying for things
that you actually need that the query is
simple you know those types of things
we're not we're not going to do that
here because our query is actually very
simple and Google App Engine makes our
indices for us but this is always the
first thing you want to check if the
index App Engine makes is an optimal for
the query you're running you may have to
make something by hand you know so you
should you should always start here you
know the first step is limit the work
the database needs to do in the worst
case let's assume we've already done
that because we have four ASCII Jim
something else we talked about was
adding more machines we don't really
have control over that in this
particular situation App Engine manages
that for us if you're not using App
Engine maybe you need to add more
machines maybe you need to start doing
replication or sharding or those
techniques now if you've ever tried to
do those techniques on your own you know
that they're very difficult they're very
complex and this is usually adding more
machines when we're talking about a
database is kind of the last resort for
scaling something else we talked about
was using bigger machines again we don't
have a whole lot of control over that on
App Engine I think you can upgrade
machines a little bit but you know let's
let's say we're done messing with that
or maybe we're tired of paying for
database queries and we just want to get
to the fun part the what we're gonna
spend this lecture talking about which
is caching a very simple thing we can do
after we've optimized the database and
we don't want to fiddle with more system
ministration is cache this query you
know an ASCII Chan the front page of
ASCII Chan only changes when somebody
submits so that means it's a good
opportunity to cache what we actually
store and that is what I'm gonna do
right now is add a little bit of caching
to ASCII Chan okay you all remember
ASCII Chan it's online at ASCII Chan com
you remember how it works we can type in
a title and then we can draw some ASCII
art or in my case paste it and when you
submit the art you see a listing of all
the previous arts submitted to ASCII
Chan the way this works in the code when
you do a get on ASCII Chan we call this
function called render front which is
defined here okay so let's render front
function basically what it does
it runs this data store query written
and equal that looks up the 10 most
recent pieces of art so limit 10 that's
how we know we're looking at pen order
by created descending so that orders
them by the time they're created this
where ancestor equals art key is a data
store technique for basically ensuring
that your query is consistent I kind of
wanted to talk about that in unit 3 but
things seem to be getting a little
complex if you read the data store Docs
you'll and kind of search for the word
consistent you'll see what this
technique is referring to so anyway not
super important for our purposes but
just so you know why that's there it's
not required if I got rid of this at our
scale the site would be behave exactly
the same so then what we do is we
actually run that query remember this
just defines the query when you iterate
over the query or in my case turn it
into a list that's when you actually go
to the database and and get the results
back remember I turn it into a list here
so that I don't accidentally run the
query twice when I ate over it again
here and then again when we actually
render the page I just want to run the
query once so what we want to do is
cache this query because our front page
isn't going to change very often
most users come to ASCII Chan and just
look at the front page we don't need to
hit the database over and over and over
again every time a user does that that's
just gonna you know cost us money waste
you know waste Google's resources and
generally just make the world a worse
place so first thing I'm going to do is
I'm going to pull out this piece of code
into its own function so it's a little
bit easier to manage okay I'm gonna call
this function top arts it's not gonna
take any parameters because we're just
returning we know what the query is
gonna be the query is gonna be the same
every time okay so all I've done is I
created this function top arts and I
copied this code actually I cut this
code from render front and moved it into
this function and then we you know we
make the query we run the query and then
we return the result and then in render
front we just call the top arts function
so everything should behave as it did
before we can go ahead and give that a
test here's our front page with our art
and if I were to reload this page we see
that nothing's changed
so nothing big there we didn't expect
anything to change and nothing good okay
so let's go back to the code and start
making our improvements now one thing
we're going to want to do
is we want to have a way of telling
ourselves when we're actually running
this query so we can actually test to
make sure our code is working now I'm
not a Google App Engine pro but I'm
gonna add a little statement like this
logging dot error and we're just going
to say this DB query and this will print
out in our error console the string DB
query now normally you should use
logging back the bug for this purpose
but the debug mode in App Engine is
driving me nuts right now so this will
be a little bit easier for me to
demonstrate I'm gonna have to also
import the logging module for this to
work I'll go ahead and do that just
import logging so this should print in
the console every time we run a DB query
and let's see if that works so here is
ASCII Chan and I'm gonna hit reload on
this page and then I'm gonna go to the
terminal and we can see that I printing
error DB query that's my string and then
we can also see that the browser fetch
slash which is the actual request to
ASCII Chan and also request favicon
which since I haven't created it just
404s
so now we have this printing and we can
see that every time I reload the page in
the browser we get these lines again and
I see the the words DB query right
before the request what we want to do is
we want to get rid of these words
without just commenting out the logging
statement okay so let's add some caching
and we're gonna use the same algorithm
we used in that quiz that you guys just
implemented we're gonna create a a
dictionary and we're gonna call it cash
now we have to have a key to cache I
usually like to store my keys in a
variable in this case I'm just going to
call the key top this is how we're gonna
store the how we're gonna reference the
result of this query in our cache and
then we're just gonna change we're just
going to rewrite this function to use
the caching algorithm so if key in cache
arts equals cache key else we want to
run our query so we run our query in the
else statement and of course we want to
store the result of our query in the
cache and then we return our arts okay
so pretty simple change now we're
caching the result of this one query
let's see if it works we go to our
browser I hit reload page loads with no
errors so that's good and then I go to
my console and I see that it printed out
DB query and has the results now if I
were to reload this page again again no
error and I go back to the console and I
can see that we made a second request
here
get slash but this time there's no TV
query so if I were to go to our front
page and hit reload trust me that I'm
doing it you can kind of see it blinking
a little bit over and over again and
then I go back to the console we can see
a bunch of requests but no DB queries
that's pretty cool huh so now our front
page is a lot faster let's submit a new
piece of art to ASCII Chan here or at
least my local ASCII Chan this is gonna
be a picture of beer looks like it's
from hofbrauhaus I click Submit huh my
beer did not appear I still have my
original art from before what do you
think happened</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
