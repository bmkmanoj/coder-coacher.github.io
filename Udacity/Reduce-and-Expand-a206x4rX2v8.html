the idea is at this level we have a full
resolution or whatever level and then we
want to take the next level down so
here's the way I think about it we'll
just number these 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 9
pixels across I actually don't have to
produce the pixels that would go under 2
4 6 and 8 because I'm just gonna I only
want half the number of pixels that I
had to start with so in fact what this
does is it simply says I'm gonna take
some location here I use the middle and
I'm gonna take what's called a five tap
filter and here are the filters see it's
1 16 416 6/16 4 16 1/16 and that's
that's what these numbers are 1/16 1/4
3/8 1/4 1/16
okay that's the filter that I use to get
the odd pixel here in the middle now
that's just in one scanline I'm working
with images how do I do this
okay go way back in your notes because I
know you're all taking copious notes
I almost said y'all when I say y'all
Megan's gonna throw that monitor at me
ok nothing against my friends from the
south but I come from New York went to
school in Boston if I actually said
y'all I think I'd get shot by my
relatives anyway you all have seen this
before we talked about separable filters
right so a separable filter was instead
of applying a square filter or a 2d
filter I apply one one-dimensional
filter horizontally and then often the
same one-dimensional filter vertically
so go back up and remember about
separable filters the reduce operator
uses a separable filter a five tap
separable filter first in the rows then
in the columns alright that one was
straightforward the expand operator is a
little bit trickier and you can tell
that by looking at this awful picture in
fact I'm gonna pull that awful picture
out by itself here's the deal the idea
is that on this picture only pixels that
are were real the question is how do you
make finer pixels from a coarser level
so here's
Corsa level here's the final level and
it turns out you do it two different
ways okay so we're gonna start with the
odd pixels alright so the odd pixels
occur underneath pixels that are
actually there so there are a couple of
ways of thinking about this one is we're
just gonna assume that we're gonna just
tell you what the filter is right that
it's 1/8 3/4 1/8 okay that seems a
little bit arbitrary until you realize
that's just kind of like if these were
zeros okay and I took in all the values
here and I made it the same 5 tap before
but now doubled it so 1/8 1/2 3/4 well
these would be in the same ratio of 1 4
6 4 1 as before
okay but I'm only pulling it off the odd
pixels all right and so these parts go
away and I'm only left with 1 a 3/4 1/8
by the way we're going to provide the
original Burton a Olson paper that talks
about reducing expands you'll be able to
to look at that a little bit more
carefully all right that's to reproduce
a pixel that's actually underneath one
that's their slightly trickier are the
even pixels we have a pixel here that's
underneath something that didn't
actually exist so if I still do the six
for one right one for six for one above
me okay well when I'm on one of these
even pixels
there's nothing directly above me and
there's nothing to my ends there's only
these two here that's this one and this
one so looking five above me only two of
them are really there they're equally
distant from me
what coefficients am I going to use I'm
going to use 1/2 so to produce this
finer value I take one half of that
pixel and 1/2 the other and then it
actually sort of makes sense if you
think about it if I'm blowing up a
picture so I'm gonna go from say 7
pixels to 214 I have to get space
between two pixels that were there what
value should I put in that space halfway
between the ones that were there before
okay the one that's a little trickier
understandable
get up how come I just don't leave this
original pixel alone and you can read in
the paper for the odd pixels you can
read in the paper the motivation in
terms of frequency theory in terms of
how they do that all you need to know is
that you now have a reduce operator and
an expand operator</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
