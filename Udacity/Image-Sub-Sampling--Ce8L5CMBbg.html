just show you that this kind of works
all right here's some optic flow results
taken from a computer vision class 2003
from a actually tutorial here listen on
the bottom and you can see that when you
run Lukasik annatee at the on that front
tree without pyramids you get sort of
terrible results and voila when you run
it with the pyramid you get a much
better result and our goal is to be able
to get that much better result but
before we can do this we have to talk a
little bit more about multiple scale so
we've been having all this multiple
scale stuff now this isn't gonna
surprise you that relates to some of the
aliasing stuff and frequency stuff that
we talked about oh God
sounds like fountain sounds feels like
months ago it's probably months ago I
have no idea what was anyway when we're
talking about Fourier analysis in
different scale and what we're gonna do
now is take a little detour through
multiscale and then we'll come back to
Lucas and conadi alright so we talked
about aliasing and now I want to show
you aliasing in in terms of image
subsampling okay so image subsampling is
what we talked about you just throw away
some number of pixels so here we have a
a nice I sure hope it's in public domain
picture by Van Gogh this is one where
you can see his ear so on the other side
I guess there's no ear you know about
that right I'm gonna sue we have some
experience with Van Gogh anyway okay
fine so the picture on the left is an
original picture where I've thrown away
every sample maybe you can't tell
picture in the middle I've thrown away
every other sample again both
horizontally and vertically
the picture on the right I've done it
again even I can tell you probably can
tell I can tell it's kind of looking
kind of crummy and in fact if I blow up
that picture on the right I see this
okay and what you're seeing here the the
junk that's in here is caused by this
this aliasing look just like we talked
about last time and when i zoom it back
up you can see that you've brought these
high frequencies in there and there's
all this stuff in here that just doesn't
seem like it's the blurry version of
what was in the original and that's
because it's not it's an alias tagalog
well we talked about this last time what
we have to do is we have to filter and
then subsample so what I've done now is
I've taken a small Gaussian smoothing
the original subsampled then smooth it
again it's
then smooth it again in subsample and
now when I blow it back up you'll notice
that the Gaussian sample down that
actually looks like a blurred version of
the thing on the left okay and that's
because I haven't done any aliasing so
to do this multi scale stuff the right
way I have to sort of do this blurring
and subsampling</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
