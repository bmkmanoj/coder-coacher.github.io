subtract one from both sides and get 2x
equals 3x minus 6
next we can subtract negative 2x from
both sides to keep our X variable
positive so I'll have 0 equals X minus 6
be really careful at this step you know
positive 2x and negative 2x sum to 0 so
we need to make sure we have a place
value over here
so if this left side is 0 that must mean
X would have to equal positive 6 since 6
minus 6 does make 0 we also see that by
just adding 6 to both sides so 6 is
equal to X or X is equal to 6 for the
right equation we want to distribute the
negative 1 first so we'll have 2x plus 1
equals negative 3x plus 5 I'm going to
move my X terms to one side by adding 3x
this also gives me a positive x variable
on the left so 5x plus 1 is equal to 5
and then we can subtract 1 to get 5x is
equal to 4 we divide both sides by 5 to
get X is equal to 4/5 so here's my
solution set X could equal 4/5 or X can
equal 6 either one of these would work
let's make sure we can check this first
x value by plugging it in for X 2 times
4/5 is 8 fifths and then I can just
change one to 5/5 so this makes 13 fists
on the left side notice that I still
have absolute value of the entire way
down my problem now I'm going to take
the absolute value of this number and I
get positive 13 fifths that's the
distance from zero for the right-hand
side I'll have 3 times 4/5 which is 12
fifths and then I'm gonna change
negative 5 into negative 25 fifths this
term is still really negative 5 I
subtract my fractions and I get negative
13 fifths or the absolute value of
negative 13 fifths the absolute value is
always positive so 13 fifths is equal to
13 fifths so yes this checks I can do
the same for the positive 6 I'll
substitute it in for X to check my
equation 2 times 6 is 12 plus 1 is 13
and notice I still have the absolute
value so the absolute value of positive
13 is 13 on the right hand side I have 3
times 6 which is 18 and the absolute
value of 18 minus 5 is the absolute
value of 13 and hey look at that
13 is equal to there
team that checks as well you might have
gotten stuck with the negative sign when
distributing or perhaps with this
fraction think about the types of
mistakes you might be making if you are
making an e and try and write them down
this would be a good reference for you
