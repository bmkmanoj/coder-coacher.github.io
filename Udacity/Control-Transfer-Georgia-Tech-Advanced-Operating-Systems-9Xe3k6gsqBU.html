virtualized setting happens implicitly
from the guest to the hypervisor how
when the guest operating system executes
any privileged instruction because it
thinks it can do it it'll result in a
trap and hypervisor will catch it and
then do the appropriate thing that's how
control is transferred from the guest to
the hypervisor implicitly
and in the other direction control
transfer happens as we already mentioned
via software interrupts or events from
the hypervisor to the guest in a para
virtualized setting the control transfer
happens explicitly via hyper calls from
the guest into the hypervisor I give you
the example of page table updates that
the guest operating system may want to
communicate to the hypervisor through
the API calls when it executes the API
call corresponding to that that results
in control transfer from the guest into
the hypervisor and similar to the full
virtualization case in para
virtualization in the other direction
that is going from the hypervisor to the
guest it is done through software
interrupts so that's how control
transfer is handled in both the fully
virtualized and para virtualized
environments the additional facility
that you have in a para virtualized
environment is the fact that the guest
has control via hyper calls on when
event notifications need to be delivered
in the case of full virtualization since
the operating system is unaware of the
existence of the hypervisor events are
going to be delivered as and when they
occur by the hypervisor to the guest but
in a para virtualized environment the
guest via hyper calls can indicate to
the hypervisor that leave me alone don't
send me any even notifications now or
you can say now is a good time to send
me even notification so that level of
control exists in a para virtualized
environment which doesn't exist in a
full virtualized environment so this is
sort of similar to an operating system
say bling interrupts that's exactly the
same facility that's available in a para
virtualized environment at the
granularity of the operating system the
operating system can say that I don't
want any event notifications I come ask
you when I need some event notifications</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
