program we need to complete the part
here where x and y should be random
numbers between minus 1 and 1
so we can't just call generator next
double because that gets a value between
0 and 1 and we want to value from minus
1 to 1 so here's the trick take the
value from 0 to 1 multiplied by 2 that
gives you a value from 0 to 2 and then
you subtract 1 which shifts it to the
left by 1 here is the final expression
and of course the very same expression
will work for Y now we need to find out
whether the point lies in the unit
circle you can compute the distance just
like you've done in the telescope
problem but it's actually a little easy
in this case I can take the square of
the distance and check whether that's
less equal 1 because the square root of
1 is just 1 don't worry about it if you
just use the formula it's not a math
class so any correct formula will do
let's run the program it wants the
number of tries we'll try a million and
we get a pretty respectable estimate for
pi now like I said there better ways of
computing pi but this method of using
random numbers for measuring objects is
really powerful when the object is
irregular when it's easy to find out
whether a point lies in it but when it's
hard to compute the area with
traditional means</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
