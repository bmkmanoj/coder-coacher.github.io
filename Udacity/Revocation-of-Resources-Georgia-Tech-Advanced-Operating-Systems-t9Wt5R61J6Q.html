no distractions it only has mechanisms
for securely giving resources to the
library operating system and the
resource may be a space resource memory
time resource or specific Hardware
resource like area of the graphic
display and so on therefore exokernel
needs a way of revoking or reclaiming
resources that have been allocated to a
library operating system of course
exokernel keeps the scoreboard as to
what resources have been allocated to
different library operating systems and
therefore at any point of time it can
revoke the resources that has been given
to a library operating system sort of
similar to a student working in my lab
if he or she graduates I might say well
it's time for you to return the key to
the lab and I have a way of revoking
that resource that I may have given to a
student for use in my lab similarly
exokernel has mechanisms for revoking
resources from a library operating
system so specifically for instance if
you think about the CPU exokernel has no
idea what the library operating system
is using the cpu for as opposed to spin
for instance which has an abstraction of
strand that represents the user level
that represents the library's notion of
a thread so exokernel has a revoke
mechanism for exactly this purpose of
revoking resources that have been
allocated to a library operating system
and the revoke call which is an up call
into the library operating system is
going to give this library operating
system a repossession vector saying
these are the resources I'm taking away
from you for instance it could say you
know remember I gave you these page
frames well i'm going to reclaim those
page frames and when it gives those
repossession vector to the library
operating system it is a responsibility
of the library operating system to do
what it needs to do in order to clean up
in other words the library takes
corrective action commensurate where
the repossession vector that has been
presented by exokernel 28 for example if
the exokernel tells this library that
I'm going to take away page frame number
20 and page frame number 25 from you
then the library operating system will
say Oh in that case I have to stash away
the contents of those page frames into
the disk so that's the kind of
corrective action that the library
operating system will have to take when
it is informed by exokernel that some
hardware resources that have been given
to it have been taken away by exokernel
to make the life of the library
operating system easier exokernel also
allows a library to seed it with auto
save options for resources that
exokernel wants to revoke so in other
words if exokernel decides to revoke
let's say some page frames from the
library operating system the library
could have ceded the exokernel ahead of
time that any time you want to take away
these page frames dump it into the disk
and that kind of seeding allows exocrine
all to do the work on behalf of the
library operating system so that at the
point of revocation the amount of work
that the library has to do in order to
do corrective action for the
repossession is minimal</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
