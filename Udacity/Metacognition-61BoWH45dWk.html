metacognition metacognition is thinking
about thinking or knowing what you know
it's really any thought process where
the target of the thought process is
actually inside your own brain so it
might be thinking about what you're
thinking about or knowing what knowledge
that you have now a key type of
metacognition in learning is called
self-regulated learning self-regulated
learning is the process by which a
person plans out how they're going to
learn something monitors how learning is
going evaluates it and then adjusts
accordingly self regulated learning is
really the goal that we want students to
reach we want them to become self
regulated learners because it's more
about active learning rather than
passive learning it's about driving your
own learning process as opposed to being
a passive consumer of whatever
information is presented to you now a
key part of self regulated learning is
the mindset that one has towards
learning there are lot of people out
there that think that they have a fixed
amount of intelligence and they are as
smart as they'll ever be and if they
can't do something it's because they
just aren't smart enough that's not
really an accurate way of framing
intelligence intelligence is much more
something that we can work out we can
grow through through effort and through
intensive study we can actually get
smarter effectively now I think
everybody has that one book that they
recommend that everybody read and mine
is actually on this topic Carol Dweck is
a Stanford psychologist who spent
decades working on motivation and
learning especially at the lower middle
and high school levels and what she
found was that ability does not
necessarily predict success at the next
level but the minds that the one has
towards learning and towards
intelligence is really the chief
predictor at whether or not someone will
be successful at the next level she
found that those people who recognize
that failure is just an opportunity to
learn as opposed to a referendum on
one's own intelligent ours really the
ones who succeed at the next level so I
highly recommend picking up this book
especially for both designing
educational technology and for self
improvement so in this lesson what we're
going to talk about is really how to use
technology to facilitate metacognitive
development we'll talk about how
technology can give the kind of
open-ended and self driven opportunities
to students that would be difficult in a
regular classroom typically classrooms
are driven by a lesson in a lecture and
it can be difficult to give students the
opportunity to drive what they're
learning at any given time but through
technology we can build more open-ended
environments in which the learner is
really put in the driver's seat and they
control what they learn and win and how
and learn in that process of monitoring
it and planning it and evaluating it so
we'll talk about how technology can
really facilitate metacognitive
development</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
