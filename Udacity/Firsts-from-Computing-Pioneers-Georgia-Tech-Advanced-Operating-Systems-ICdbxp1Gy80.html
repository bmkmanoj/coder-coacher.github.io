in time and look at the thought pieces
from computer visionaries in particular
I want to draw your attention to this
memorandum that was done back in 1963
that talks about intergalactic computer
networks I encourage you to do a web
search and get this document and read it
here is another one this document talks
about the first time computers talked to
one another the first computer computer
communication back in October 29 1969
now this is considered the first ever
email that was written by Ray Tomlinson
from BBN technologies back in 1971 and
with all the junk mail that is floating
around you might be wondering why email
was invented in the first place but it
is a useful tool when it is not junk
this is a log book that was maintained
by Professor Leonard Klein rock of UCLA
who is considered one of the networking
pioneers and this logbook records the
first time there was a computer to
computer communication a call was made
from UCLA the Stanford Research
Institute host-to-host communication
recorded on October 29 1969 and this is
the first ever computer to computer
communication here is another
interesting chart this chart shows all
the computers in the world in one chart
March of 1977 this is your entire
internet on one chart back in 1977 and
the model of a computer system back in
1975 was you had a mainframe computer
which consisted of a cpu memory and i/o
devices like a disk and you have cathode
ray terminals through which users can
connect to the CPU and use the CPU in a
time shared manner so this was the model
of the computer back in 19 cm
d5 note that I'm not showing any
connection to any network here the
reason I'm giving you this build up with
all the firsts in computer technology
and the model of the computer system is
because the seminal paper by jerome
Saltzer identifies terminologies you and
i know as currently issues examples
include denial of service firewalls
sandboxing objects and so on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
