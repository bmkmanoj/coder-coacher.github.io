look through some of the files that
gives us we've got a bunch of files for
setup package managers and testing up in
the directories the important ones are
public dist config and app you put your
static assets like font files and images
in here when you're ready to move your
site to the web ember can build and
bundle everything together and put it in
here configures where you'll add code
that changes the configuration of the
project or if the project needs to
change based on the environment it's in
but probably ninety nine percent of your
time will be spent in the app directory
let's go through it ember is highly
dependent on routes so rider ojs is not
hidden away in a folder will be looking
at routes and routing next here's the
apps index file we actually won't really
be touching any of this here's the
projects main setup file we also aren't
going to be doing anything in here
either templates are very important to
Emperor any HTML we write will be in
here remember when we looked at our app
in the browser and it said welcome to
ember that file is right here Styles is
for where we can put any custom CSS for
our project I said routing is important
to ember not only is there a router file
but there's also this routes directory
this is where individual route files
will live we'll be looking at this next
models is where we would put schema
files for the apps data if we want to
add additional functionality to our
templates we'd create helper files and
place them in here in ember controllers
are very similar to components and are
actually being phased out in future
versions so we won't be working with
controllers ember makes it really easy
to create our own custom HTML elements
it refers to them as components the
functionality goes in here while the
components HTML file goes in here all of
this was generated with the Ember new
command ember favors convention over
configuration meaning that ember has its
way of doing things and as long as you
do it there ember way you won't have to
worry about configuration an example of
this is where to put a file and how to
name it a component has to live in the
components directory and be named a
certain way we don't want to worry about
all of embers conventions though so
we'll just use ember CLI to generate and
maintain our files the first thing to do
with a new app is to set up routing so
let's set up some routes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
