again and let's start talking about sort
of the most important part this is the
part of the your eye the retina it's the
part of your brain that is in your eye
now here is a picture a schematic of a
retina okay and first you'll notice
there are these receptors called rods
and cones and we'll talk about those in
a minute and then those receptors
connect to these things called
horizontal and bipolar cells which take
the chemical output of the receptors and
eventually turn them into stimulation
for these ganglion cells
which are the first proper nurse
licensed a proper they're the nerve
cells that actually produce firing
spikes that were used to for nerve cells
but when you look at this you should
look at that curvature and it should
bother you a little bit right so here's
the picture of my eye okay but you see
of course my thing is is bent this way
and this thing is sort of bent that way
so actually what I need to do and I'm
really proud of this is we need to
rotate that picture so this curvature
here is like this curvature there at
which point you realize what comes up
this way the light alright the human
system has what's referred to as an
inverted retina okay and that is the
light comes in and passes through all of
this gunk it passes through there are
blood vessels in here there's nerve so
it passes right through them then it
hits your photoreceptors okay and then
any stray light keeps going sort of gets
absorbed this background layer this is
called the pigment epithelium this is
actually a very black pigment in the
back Yuri
so you might ask why would you build an
inverted retina why would you build an
inverted retina nobody asked me but
here's some some speculation there are a
couple of things the reason that the
best is what happens is is that the
light goes through here and anyone that
happens to hit the photoreceptors right
there
gets absorbed and then after that it
hits this pigment epithelium
okay and what that means is the pigment
epithelium absorbs any stray light so it
eliminates scatter within the within the
eye and that gives you a very sharp
resolution it reduces your ability to
see at night a little bit we'll talk
about the sensitivity of rods and cones
in a little bit but it gives you this
this idea that you know first the light
whatever light gets absorbed by the
detectors goes into processing and
everything else is absorbed and removed
it doesn't cause any disturbance it does
mean that there's a funny sort of thing
that goes on these structures produce
they're very they're clear because
they're made out of you know gelatinous
stuff that is biological tissue but of
course it causes little shadows right so
if you go right past the blood vessel
will be actually a little bit of a
shadow so you might ask why don't we see
these shadows why don't we see these
shadows the human eyeball is remarkable
anything that's perfectly stabilized on
your eye the brain just removes okay so
that shadow stays exactly in the same
place on the retina the brain just
removes it in fact there's some cool
tricks you can do by building little
state stabilization systems that will
keep something projected exactly the
same place on the eye and eventually you
just don't see it so anyway so that's
the inverted retina of the eye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
