what we're going to use is a
probabilistic test and that means if
some number X passes the test the
probability that X is composite is less
than some value and we're going to use
probabilities like to the negative 128
this is certainly low enough for most
uses in cryptography one way to think
about that is if the key size is 128
bits we already have that probability
that someone would randomly guess that
key correctly so the main basis of
probabilistic prime ality tests is
properties of prime numbers one useful
theorem about prime numbers is Fermat's
little theorem which states that if P is
prime if we select some number a between
1 and P and raise a to the P minus 1
power modulo P the result must always be
1 so maybe we could try lots of a's and
if this equation always holds that a to
the P minus 1 is congruent to 1 mod T
well that would mean that P is probably
prime so the problem is that there are
some composite numbers that are known as
Carmichael numbers where this test also
holds for most a values indeed it holds
for all the a values that are relatively
prime with P so unless we try all the a
numbers between 1 and P there's a high
probability that this will always hold
if we need to try them all well this
test isn't fast enough it's still going
to be exponential in the size of P the
good news is there's a faster test which
is known as the Rabin Miller test
sometimes it's known as the Miller Rabin
test it was discovered independently by
both Miller and Raven the main idea was
originally proposed by Gary Miller in
1976 he provided a deterministic test
based on the assumption that the Reimann
hypothesis was true Michael Rabin who
won the Turing award in 1976 probably
did some of his more important work
after winning the Turing award which is
quite unusual proposed this in 1980 and
that's the one that we'll talk about so
here's how this works and I'm not going
to cover the mathematics behind it but
just enough to be able to implement the
test I'm going to start with our guess
in which must be odd obviously if it's
even it's not prime and because it's odd
that means we can write it as a multiple
of two plus one so that means we can
break it in two
- to some power T times s plus one
next when to choose some random a value
in this range from 1 to n minus 1 if n
is prime we know that either a to the S
is equal to 1 mod n or we know that a to
the s times 2 to the J is equal to n
minus 1 mod n for some J and the J
values are in the range from 0 to t
minus 1 which is the power here and
that's a big advantage that we only need
to try a small number of values if we
don't find any value that satisfies this
we know it's composite so the important
property that this test has that's
different from the Fermata test is that
the probability that a composite number
passes is always less than some constant
in this case it's less than 1/4 there no
bad composite numbers like the
Carmichael numbers if we choose a
randomly for any composite number the
probability of if it has passed is is
less than 1/4</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
