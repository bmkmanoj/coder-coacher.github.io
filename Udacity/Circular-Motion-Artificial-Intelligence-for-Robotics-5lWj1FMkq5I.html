class you already programmed a particle
filter for a really simplistic robot
that was able to measure ranges to
landmarks and moved pretty much like a
trash bin now I'd like to replace it
with a more interesting robot is more
realistic in particular I like you to
use a car so here's a car a car tends to
have two fixed tires and two steerable
tires in the front suppose the location
of our car in a coordinate system is
given by its x-coordinate and
y-coordinate and I'm picking the halfway
point on the react cell as a reference
point and by its heading direction theta
so the state will be X Y and the
orientation theta then this car also has
a steering angle it's called the alpha
the question is how is the state
affected by driving a certain distance D
with a fixed steering angle assume the
initial state is X Y and theta it turns
out to answer this I also need to know
the length of the vehicle
which I will just call L for length
there is a constant throughout our
consideration this is usually called a
bicycle model obviously it suffices to
look at one pair of tires because the
other one at least an approximation
finds pretty much parallel so if you
look at the robot locally where we have
a steering angle Alfre robot length L
and we're driving the rear tire for a
distance D then the robot will turn to
the left and it's turning angle better
is proportional to the distance that the
real tire moves forward divided by the
length of the vehicle
times the tangents of the steering angle
now compute the changes of X Y and theta
in the local coordinate system we as a
turning radius R of this robot is simply
the distance we drive forward divided by
better so as well we'll be simple math
which I don't want to explain in detail
this means that the robot is turning
around at a point over here call it CX
and CY and after the turn the vehicle is
located somewhere over here in global
coordinates years the way we describe
there
see X is the x corner of the robot X
minus now equal to the left the sign of
the over orientation before motion times
radius R similarly see why is this
expression over here y plus cosine of
the orientation times R and then after
motion we can go back from CX ocy to a
new state over here simply by adding in
the turning radius better that is our
new X is CX plus sine of theta plus
better times radius and notice how this
parallels this guy over here except for
two changes where we previously
subtracted we're now adding and we're
adding better to the argument of the
sine same with Y and the orientation is
just increased by better model o to pi
now this all works if there was actually
turning if the world were to go straight
then R will become infinity by this
division over here so for small betters
in my code is smaller than 0.001 we can
approximate this all as straight motion
our new X is the old x times our driven
distance pointed in the cosine of the
heading direction similarly for y we go
in sign of a direction and the heading
direction stays the same
you could add better which is basically
zero to be slightly more precise or you
could just use theta doesn't really
matter so in this problem the assignment
I'd like you to implement this piece of
math over here in our particle filter
and to make sure we incremented it
correctly I will give you some example
data that you can check so now first
part I prepared a lot of software for
you basically copying the old particle
filter software over and removing the
motion in the measurement model for now
and in this case I just wanted you to
practice the motion model so we assume a
length of the order of 20 be initialized
server with this length parameter and
for this first iteration we assume no
steering noise and no distance noise I
set the robot to 0 0 0 in the beginning
and then I cache away a number of
motions and the way to read those is
this one word is moving right
ten in total with the steering angle of
zero then it moves another ten with the
steering angle of pi divided by six and
then it moves 20 again with the steering
angle of zero a PI over six is the left
steering so the robot foot changes
coordinates in the beginning just in the
X direction because it's facing an x
direction over here then two and left
little bit go forward and go straight
again scrolling down a little bit I also
give you the code to run the robot we've
created it over here you print the
initial coordinate and then for each of
the motions in this list over here we
apply the my robot equals my robot move
command and we print out the successor
command so if you get this right this is
the numbers I would like to see
initially the volar position is zero
zero zero that's just one over here it's
our first print command and then moves
forward in x-direction by ten
orientation stays zero so that's why
because there's no steering and now we
steer this affects X it doesn't quite
move ten it only moves 9.8 six in y
direction it moves one point four three
three and there's no orientation as
point two eight eight six and then we
move straight again and now the x
coordinate we 9:03 y coordinate becomes
seven point one two orientation point
two eight so your code should output
exactly the same value source over here
and just to give you a second test so
this is a sequence of ten motions where
the word always moves ten forwards and
over students right by an angle of 0.2
in radians and we look at the outputs
did we get the following array you can
see that the orientation starting at
zero which is the same as 2 pi decreases
all the way to five point two to six and
you can also see the robot starts
running in a circle whereas initially we
add almost 10 to the X Direction numbers
nothing to the right direction as we
come down here we subtract quite a bit
in y direction because inaudible what is
going on a circle so you should look at
these numbers over here and see if your
code matches these exact numbers that
might call it outputs</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
