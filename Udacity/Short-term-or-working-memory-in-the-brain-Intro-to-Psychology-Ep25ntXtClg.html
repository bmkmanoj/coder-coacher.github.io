happens when we're engaging in
short-term or working memory here we see
that the prefrontal cortex focuses
attention on a sensory stimuli and will
hold the information long enough for us
to solve the problem at hand then and
we'll transfer the information to the
hippocampus for memory consolidation we
also know that the encoding stage of
memory is consolidated through rehearsal
and repetition so if we repeatedly fire
the neural impulses that are necessary
to convert a short-term memory to a
long-term memory this will occur in the
hippocampus now the main reason Henry
mOLAISON rhm could no longer form
long-term memories is because a large
part of his hippocampus was removed but
as I said we know that the hippocampus
isn't the only thing that's important
for working memory we also need our
prefrontal cortex which is responsible
for our ability to maintain attention
and focus so when you're reading having
a conversation or looking at a map and
trying to figure out directions it's our
prefrontal cortex that allows us to keep
this information available do you
remember earlier in the lesson we when
we discussed the visio spatial sketchpad
and phonological loop well we see that
in each of these areas is where brain
activity occurs during each of these
processes so we know that auditory input
is processed and rehearsed in the
phonological loop from the prefrontal
cortex to the language comprehension
Center which is located to the back and
left part of the parietal lobes we call
this language comprehension Center the
Verna Keys region after the person who
discovered it you may remember this when
we talked about it in lesson three as
for visual information in the
visuospatial sketchpad it goes from the
prefrontal cortex to the temporal lobes
for spatial information and then to the
occipital lobe for visual information
now we know that our explicit memory
storage are stored in the respective
cortex in the area that it was
originally processed now other types of
memories such as implicit memories are
stored in structures of the sub cortex
specifically the striatum amygdala and
cerebellum</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
