network uses shared parameters across
space to extract patterns over an image
now you're going to do the same thing
but over time instead of space this is
the idea behind recurrent neural
networks imagine that you have a
sequence of events at each point in time
you want to make a decision about what's
happened so far in the sequence imagine
that you have a sequence of events at
each point in time you want to make a
decision about what's happened so far in
the sequence if your sequence is
reasonably stationary you can use the
same classifier at each point in time
that simplifies things a lot already but
since this is a sequence you also want
to take into account the past everything
that happened before that point when
natural thing to do here is to use the
state of the previous classifier as a
summary of what happened before
recursively now you would need a very
deep neural network to remember far in
the past imagine that this sequence
could have hundreds thousands of steps
it would basically mean to have a deep
network with hundreds or thousands of
layers but instead we're going to use
tying again and have a single model
responsible for summarizing the past and
providing that information to your
classifier what you end up with is a
network with a relatively simple
repeating pattern with part of your
classifier connecting to the input at
each time step and another part called
the recurrent connection connecting you
to the past at each step</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
