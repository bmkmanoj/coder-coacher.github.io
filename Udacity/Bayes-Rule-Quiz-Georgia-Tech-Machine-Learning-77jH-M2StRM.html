let me let me set up the the situation
for you so a man goes to see his doctor
okay because you know his back hurts or
something and she gives him oh I know
it's really sad it's his the left side
of his lower back and he's been playing
too much racquetball anyway so a man
goes to see a doctor and she gives him a
lab test now this test is pretty good
okay it returns a correct positive that
is if you have the thing that this lab
test is testing for it will say you have
it 98% of the time okay so it only gives
you a false positive 2 percent of the
time I'm at the same time it will return
a correct negative that is if you don't
have what the lab test is testing for it
will say you don't have it 97 percent of
the time so it has a false negative rate
of only 3% wait hang on so just what's
his problem
oh that's a question so the test looks
for a disease so give me a disease
spleen okay I like that so the test
looks for spleentitis now spleentitis is
such a rare disease that nobody's ever
heard of it
and it turns out that it's so rare that
only about this fraction of the
population has it okay that makes sense
so we're looking for spleentitis it's a
very rare disease but this test is
really good at determining whether you
have it or determining whether you don't
have it can I tell you that it's
spleentitis appears zero times in Google
so it really is quite rare it really is
quite rare but what does Google know
okay so you got it all Michael yeah so
it's a really rare disease and we have a
very accurate test for it good man goes
to see the doctor she gives him a lab
test it's a pretty good lab test it's
checking for spleentitis relatively rare
disease and the test comes back positive
oh yes so test is positive so here is
the quiz question should we be Ned
notifying his next of kin yes does he
have spleentitis that you said just said
he had spleentitis no I said the test
says he has spleentitis
so the test looks for spleentitis and
the test came back positive so does he
have spleentitis yes or no all right
before I try to answer that can I just
ask for clarification please
so that 98 is a percentage in 97 as a
percentage is point 0:08 all
percentage no it's not so if I wanted to
convert it to a percentage it would be
0.8% got it all right now I think I have
what I need okay all right so you think
about it go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
