correct but the strongest one of them is
so if you show just one single and P
complete problem requiring exponential
time to be solved then all np-complete
problems will require exponential time
to solve and the reason for that is that
all np-complete problems are connected
to each other using polynomial time
reductions so if one of them requires
exponential time and another one
requires polynomial time then that just
cannot be because say if this problem
here requires polynomial time then that
would mean that you can solve sat for
example in polynomial time which would
then mean that you can solve this
problem over here in polynomial time and
so on and so on all problems that are
np-complete are from a viewpoint of
polynomial or exponential time equally
hard to solve which would also mean that
the weaker statement here is true some
problems in NP are only solvable in
exponential time yes if all np-complete
problems require exponential times and
there are problems in NP which require
exponential time
finally this statement down here that is
not true all problems in NP are only
solvable in exponential time that is not
true
not all problems in NP require
exponential time so remember our picture
from before where we said that P is
basically a subset of NP so these
problems here will still be solvable in
polynomial time it doesn't matter if
there are some problems in here that
require exponential time it doesn't
affect these problems here in P</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
