simple connector the procedure called
connector provided by all all your
friendly programming languages first of
all there's a flow of control that is
controls with its with the calling
routine and then control shifts to be
with the called routine so that's a
coordination rule
there's transmission of data via the
parent parameter so that's a
communication role procedure call is so
common so pervasive a part of
programming languages that it's the
basis for all of the composite
connectors that is when we make a
complex connector out of simpler
connectors for example in the Java
method call we have the caller McCauley
yeah there's exactly one at any given
time that's exactly one caller and one
call e so we can say the fan-in is one
the fan-out is one as well sounds simple
right
but there's all kinds of variations for
example how are the parameters
transmitted
well there's call-by-reference called by
value called by name
there could be default values keyword
parameters in line parameters there's a
return value things could be provided by
invocation records by a hash table and
even the order evaluation is a variant
are the arguments which might themselves
be procedure calls method calls
evaluated left to right or right to left
or whatever some languages provide for
multiple entry points that is when you
call a method you may enter that method
in different places is the invocation
explicit as it wouldn't be in a method
call or is it implicit as it might be in
an object-oriented language in which
there's delegation and the ultimate
collie isn't known specifically by the
car usually we think of procedure calls
as synchronous but there are also
situations where procedure calls can be
asynchronous we mentioned the
possibility of different fan ins and fan
outs
okay and then there's the issue the
variation that is allowed as far as
accessibility is concerned we know for
example
programming languages allow for only
private access that is within the same
class or protected access to the method
from the particular class or its parents
or children classes and then public ask
access where any other the caller can be
any place</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
