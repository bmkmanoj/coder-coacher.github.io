most important thing to understand about
the Internet is that it is not run by
any single entity but by a collection of
thousands of autonomous systems that
share information
examples of these autonomous systems or
a SS for short include Google MIT
Georgia Tech Comcast and so forth each
of these autonomous systems is
responsible for routing traffic within
itself this is called intra-domain
routing and as you might imagine there
are some interesting algorithmic
problems here that have a shortest path
like character you can explore this
further by taking a networking class or
consulting the links in the instructor
notes inter domain routing which is
essential to connecting these often
regional guesses together gets a little
more complex because of the various
business interest among these entities
they don't share all of their routing
information with each other but they do
advertise their ability to reach public
IPs with a protocol called BGP for
border gateway protocol the essentials
of such an advertisement are the IP
address that they're advertising that
they can reach the next hop or the
address of the entry point into the
advertising a s and the a s path which
captures the sequence of a assets that a
packet along the route would need to
travel through and they asked receiving
such a message would incorporate the
information into its own routing tables
so that it knows where to forward
packets to take an example suppose
Comcast wanted to advertise my IP
address then it would send an
advertisement to his partners which
would include let's say a level 3 they s
path on the advertisement would just be
Comcast's own a s number and the next
hop would be the desired entry point or
gateway into the Comcast network one of
Comcast's partners let's say level 3
then might want to advertise my IP
address to say the Apple a s and so it
would send another BGP packet with my IP
address their gateway as the next hop
and the a s path of level 3 and then
Comcast after all this information has
been incorporated into the routing
tables all the routers in the Apple
network know how to send the data back
to my machine they have their own
internal routing before sending it to
layer 3 who does its own internal
routing before sending it to Comcast who
does then its internal round
to get the message to my house</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
