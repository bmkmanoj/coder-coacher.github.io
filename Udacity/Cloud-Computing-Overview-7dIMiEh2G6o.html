provides the following first a pool of
shared resources these can come in as
infrastructure compute storage
networking that doesn't mean that the
cloud provider like Amazon is renting
out physical machines or physical disks
but instead that it's renting out of
virtual machines that are even
potentially interconnected to form some
virtual clusters of such VMs along with
some ability to store some amount of
state in the underlying storage cloud
computing can also come in as shared
resources that are used by higher-level
software services so these are soft
resources for instance this can
correspond to certain popular services
like email or database or some
processing Kuran times so it may be
easier to just rent all of the
infrastructure along with the software
stack that's appropriately configured as
opposed to as a customer to comment and
rent actual infrastructure and then deal
with the deployment of the servers the
configuration and the management of the
service so both of these are options in
terms of what it is that cloud computing
provides as a resource these
infrastructure software resources are
all made available via some api's for
access and configuration the point is
that they need to be accessed and
manipulated as necessary remotely over
the Internet this typically includes
web-based api's also api's that are
wrapped in a libraries that can be
integrated in popular language runtimes
like Java or command-line interfaces or
other types of tools providers offer are
many different types of billing and
accounting services there is an entire
marketplace surrounding these cloud
services and cloud resources that
includes price Inc models but spot
prices or reservations for future prices
or other types of models one common
characteristic is that billing is
typically not done based on actual usage
just because the overheads that are
associated with ultra fine grained
monitoring and management tend to be
pretty high and instead billing guest
based on some discrete step function for
instance computer resources may come in
some number of pre-configured
alternatives like tiny and medium and
large and extra-large and each of these
will have a different cost so then the
user picks which one of these matches
their needs and then P is the
corresponding grade when using the VM
and all of these finally is managed by
the cloud provider via some
sophisticated software stack common
software stacks that are used in this
space include the open source open stack
and also the vmware vsphere software
stack</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
