emerged for all the expressions for the
balances after a certain number of years
was like this we take the principal the
amount initially invested multiply it by
1 plus the interest rate written as a
decimal and then take that quantity that
I've written in parentheses to a power
that's equal to the number of times
interest has been added to the account
in this case since interest is
compounded yearly that was just equal to
the number of years that have passed
let's try doing something similar but
with a different situation remember
Athena well she has three hundred
dollars to invest the interest rate on
the account she's going to put it in is
five percent per year compounded
annually how much money will she have in
the account after four years have passed
remember that pattern that we were using
before</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
