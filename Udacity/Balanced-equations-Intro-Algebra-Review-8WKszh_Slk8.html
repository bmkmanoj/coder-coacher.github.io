minus 4 equals 7 when solving an
equation the goal is to get the variable
on one side of the equation alone with a
coefficient of 1 you are not done until
your equation is in this form with the
equation of X minus 4 equals 7 we can do
this by adding 4 to both sides of the
equation and then we get X plus 0
because negative 4 plus 4 equals 0
equals 7 plus 4 so why did we add 4 to
both sides of the equation why can't we
just add it to one side that's because
an equation is perfectly balanced we can
think of equations as scales that have
to have the same value on both sides if
you perform an operation on one side but
not the other side of the equation
the equation will be out of balance and
therefore it is no longer true so if I
add 4 to one side of my equation but not
the other side my equation is no longer
in balance I have to do the same thing
to the other side to rebalance the
equation so how did I decide on 4 to add
it's because I'm trying to get X by
itself and negative 4 plus positive 4
equals 0 we can check our work here by
substituting 11 in for X in the original
equation X minus 4 equals 7 becomes 11
minus 4 equals 7 11 minus 4 is indeed
equal to 7 so we did it right let's try
another one
find X if X plus 12 equals 16 enter your
answer here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
