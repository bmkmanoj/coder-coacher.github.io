coated aperture here basically we looked
at where idea of different you know
types of kernels here a larger scale
correct scale and a smaller scale and of
course we have the coated apertures of
course also scaled down if you had an
image like this to be reconstructed on a
conventional the again Lucy Richardson
types of the convolution method you
would get a lot of ringing of course we
do it at the correct scale so the size
of the kernel matches the kind of signal
that's in the original image you'll do
much better but of course if you do it a
smaller scale you actually will add
other forms of blur of course secret is
to figure out which of these scales to
do this kind of stuff we've looked at
that concept when we looked at all the
frequency domain and fading and blending
stuff but in case of coded of course we
have an artifact that we might actually
generate something like this but we
actually do get a much better image at
the right scale and of course a little
bit of blurriness and ringing at the
scale that's smaller I do encourage you
to look at the Levine a tall paper
that'll gives you more details about
this kind of stuff and how to choose the
right scale</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
