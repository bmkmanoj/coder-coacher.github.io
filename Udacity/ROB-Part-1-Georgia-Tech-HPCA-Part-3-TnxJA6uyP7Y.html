reorder buffer to hold the results of
instructions until they're ready to
finish in program order let's see what
it looks like the reorder buffer is a
table of entries in each entry we keep
at least three fields one says what the
value produced by the instruction is
this is the value that we are not
writing to the register when the
instruction finishes it will now write
its value to the reorder buffer when it
broadcasts we need a bit here to tell us
whether we actually have a valid value
here or not because we will give a
reorder buffer entry to the instruction
before it actually writes the result and
finally in the end we have to write this
value to an actual register and for that
we need to know when we do such a write
when we move this value from the reorder
buffer to a register what register are
we going to write to this is a reorder
buffer that can hold up to 8
instructions and we keep instructions in
the reorder buffer in program order so
we need two pointers one pointer tells
us when we issue the next instruction
where does it go another one tells us
when we finally complete in program
order the next instruction which
instruction is it going to be so in this
particular reorder buffer the
instructions that are actually valid are
starting from the oldest one to the
newest one this the even newer
instructions are going to be added here
and the oldest one will complete from
here so these five instructions are
actually in program order in the reorder
buffer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
