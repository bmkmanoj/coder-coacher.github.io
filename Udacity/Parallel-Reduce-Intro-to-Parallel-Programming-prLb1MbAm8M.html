expose a little bit of parallelism and
we're going to do that by first
computing a plus B and perhaps at the
same time computing C plus D and then
add the results together now what's that
going to look like in terms of our tree
structure so now we've got cereal reduce
and parallel reduce side by side here
she'll reduce in the equation
here's parallel reduce in the equation
now what we've done to do parallel
reduce is regrouping these operations in
a different order and this exposes more
concurrency we now have the ability to
run multiple operations in parallel at
the same time now you see why
associativity was a necessary quality of
the reduction operator we can
reassociate operations to expose more
concurrency then we can run concurrent
operations in parallel to reduce the
time to solution let's see how this
works with our for element reduction
let's compare our serial reduction and
our parallel reduction both of these
have three additions both of them have
three units of work but whereas the
serial reduction has one two three steps
to complete the parallel reduction only
has one two steps to complete so
potentially we can run this with
parallel hardware and it will complete
faster if we extend this problem
to reduce a set of elements of size n
we're very interested in the work and
the step complexity as a function of n
so what's the complexity of these four
metrics so three of them are pretty
straightforward the serial
implementation here has both order of n
linear work and linear steps and the
parallel reduction also has linear work
so it's also o of n but this one's a
little bit more complicated to compute
so let's dive in and take a look at this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
