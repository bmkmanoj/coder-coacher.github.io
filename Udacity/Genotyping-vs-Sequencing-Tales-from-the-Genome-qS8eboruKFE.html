amplified so we have enough of our
sample to do something with are we ready
to go sequence it now is that what we're
gonna do so the process that your DNA
undergoes at 23andme is a little
different to sequencing it's called chip
hybridization or genotyping and so how
does this differ from sequencing what's
the difference between sequencing and
sort of which you mentioned is sort of
chip hybridization or for for genotyping
so you can think of sequencing as just
reading the genome from beginning to end
almost you want to know every single
letter and what it is with genotyping we
actually decide beforehand which parts
of the genome or which letters are
interesting to us and then we
specifically look at those letters with
the knowledge that these are the letters
that maybe cause diseases or are
associated with some trait that you have
I see so so you actually have to put a
lot of thought into it beforehand to
sort of know exactly which positions
which bases which letters you're
interested in how how many letters do
you actually um or how many bases do you
look at in an individual sample it's a
good a good about a million on the
current 23andme chip that means that
when you get your results back from us
you can download a million different
calls or base pairs from us sequencing
sounds like it gives you a lot more
information what are the prohibitive
aspects of sequencing why doesn't
23andme do sequencing
yeah sequencing is definitely the future
of this field and we we're definitely
interested in sequencing when it gets
cheap enough but the main advantage of
genotyping is cost so we know that to
get the same results that we get with
the 23andme chip we would have to charge
at least 10 times more with the
sequencing product probably a lot more
do you know typing has other advantages
as well we because you genotype using
the process of hybridization you
actually get a lot of different shots on
goal if you like you get to hybridize
different molecules many times and you
get the sum of all of those or the
average of all the
reads so you get a lot of information
compiled into one data point with
sequencing you might actually miss the
part of the genome you were interested
in and that could be a problem
I see so in a way you kind of have
higher confidence even though you have
maybe more limited information in the
end you have a higher confidence about
the actual you know letter or base
result for that position exactly and
some people describe genotyping is
almost like single base sequencing where
we're seeing we're sequencing hundreds
of thousands of molecules on each part
of the chip so there's an advantage
there that's hard to replicate the
sequencing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
