fall down in an interesting fashion as
you deviate from 10 11 12 13 14 all the
way to 0 or 20 so obviously if you get a
kerf it looks a bit like this this curve
is often called a bell curve because
it's quite feasible to think of it as a
church bell the goose gets moved left
and right and rings the bells so I did a
related experiment actually a vote a
piece of software to flip a coin a
thousand times and if he did the last
optional units on programming you wrote
a piece of software to flip a coin a
thousand times from that I looked at the
empirical frequency but is the same as
the count of heads divided by a thousand
but this one scales between zero and one
so I called this thing an experiment I
flipped the coin 2,000 times out comes a
one singular number which is the ratio
of heads to the total number of
experiments it should be 0.5 in the
ideal case but often it's a little bit
of 0.5 I repeat it there's experiment
one thousand times and that means I got
one thousand samples of this ratio over
here when I do this I get a whole bunch
of means when I run a histogram over
those I might see a curve what shape do
you think the curve has it's gonna be
like this it's gonna be like this like
this or like this or focus on 0.5 which
one do you think is it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
