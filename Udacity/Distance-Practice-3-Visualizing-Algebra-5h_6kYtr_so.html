the square root of 74 great problem
solving if you found it we'll start by
drawing a rough sketch on the points on
the coordinate plane if we want to find
this distance between the two points we
set up a right triangle in
two-dimensional space the horizontal
distance goes from x equals negative 2
to x equals positive 3 so we know that
this distance is a horizontal distance
between the values of negative 2 and
positive 3 which is a total distance of
five units for this vertical distance we
want to find the difference between the
Y values or the change in them we start
at y equals negative 3 and we climb all
the way up to y equals for this distance
so we know that this distance is 7 units
keep in mind of the distance on this
vertical axis or between the Y
coordinates is the same out here this is
a vertical distance that's the same as
this one so we'll have the change in x
squared which is 5 squared plus the
change in Y squared which is 7 squared
equals d squared R I potenuse squaring
these numbers and finding this sum will
get 74 equals d squared now we just take
the square root of both sides keeping
only the positive root so 1 D is equal
to the square root of 74 now if we try
to simplify the square root of 74 we
notice that its factors are two and 37
these are not perfect squares so we just
leave our answer as the square root of
74</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
