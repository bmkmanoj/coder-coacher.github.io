that everyone should include in their
resume but what about those of you who
are making a career change are new to
the field or want to make your
personality shine if you're making a
career change for example we recommend
that you include a summary statement
below you're heading section what is the
summary statement it is a two to three
sentence statement that functions as a
resume elevator pitch it helps to frame
your professional resumes speaks to your
passions strengths and current career if
this sounds like your background draft a
summary statement in your master resume
you can customize this later in your
one-page resume new to the field and
have limited experience be sure to
include all the projects and coursework
you've completed at Udacity even if you
didn't do this at a job these examples
will provide evidence of your work
finally want to show your personality if
you feel like your resume is lacking an
interest and you have ample space
include information about any
achievements activities organizations
and relevant hobbies this helps humanize
your resume and depending on the company
you're applying to can convey your
culture fit before moving on to the next
step fill out the section in your master
resume spreadsheet</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
