thing for last I've got a deal with leap
years and my campaign to eliminate leap
years has not been successful so we've
got to figure out a way to figure out if
it's a leap year and the rules for leap
years are pretty complicated let's see
what wikipedia has to tell us about that
this is quite interesting you can see
how accurate the solstices over time the
leap days go but the great thing here is
it actually has code and it's not Python
code but it's pretty close but this is a
very clear way that describe the
algorithm for determining whether a
year's a leap here or not if it's
divisible by 400 then it's a leap year
if it's divisible by 100 then it's not
if it was not divisible by 400
it was Davila by 4 than its leap year
otherwise it's not a leap year so let's
turn that into code I'm going to cut and
paste that so I can see if I was doing
this with a smaller font size or a
larger screen I could see that at the
same time so I wouldn't have to cut and
paste it but it's a good thing to have
as a comment anyway so all we got to do
now is turn that into Python and I could
do it in a straightforward way I'm gonna
be a little bit lazier and save some
typing by doing it in one line let me
reconsider I'm going to try to get this
right the first time please use a few
more lines of code and I will follow
what wikipedia says more carefully so if
the Year mod 400 is equal to zero we're
gonna return true it is a leap year if
the year mod 100 is equal to zero we're
gonna return false it's not a leap year
if the year mod four is equal to zero
we're gonna return true and if not but
we don't actually need the else because
we've been returning we're gonna return
false so let's test that and if I wasn't
thinking this was simple I would
probably write some special test cases
to test leap years I'm gonna do it by
hand with a few test cases now because I
think there aren't too many difficult
ones so 2,000 is divisible by 400 should
be a leap year 2100 is not divisible by
400 so should not be a leap year and
2012 should be a leap year and 2013
should not be a leap year so I think I'm
fairly confident that I got that right
so now we're gonna try to put that in
two days in months we need to change the
case for days and month when the month
is February now we need to check the
year
and if it's a leap year we return 29
otherwise return 28 and I don't need the
else here I'm gonna put the else in just
to make it look more balanced okay so
now let's run our current test make sure
we didn't break something they all
finished that's a good sign let's add
some tests that depend on leap years so
we're gonna test the next day for
February 20 if it is a leap year and we
should do some long year tests the
number of days in the leap year should
be 366 so I've got those two let's also
add the tests that we did by hand and
let's see and the tests all passed and
now we should try running it on the
tests that were provided</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
