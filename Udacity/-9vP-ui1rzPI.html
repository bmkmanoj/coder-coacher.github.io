meme of myself and let's analyze the way
this text is drawn memes tend to use
white text that is outlined in black and
this makes it easy to read the text no
matter what background it's over so in
this case the like here is on top of a
light background but we can read it
really easily because of the black
outline and then down here over my dark
shirt because the letters have white
fills inside they're easily legible
there too so this is a nice strategy for
making sure that text is always legible
the way this is accomplished is with the
mix of fill and Stroke text to the
scripts I've added this method stroke
text which is going to draw the string
hello Udacity and it's going to put it
at the point 5010 now note here that
this 50 is going to be in the case of
this text the lower left hand corner of
the text so if this were 00 we wouldn't
be able to see the text because the
lower left hand corner would be at zero
and the rest of the text would be above
the page so that's just something to
note let's go ahead and see what happens
when we call this method come over here
and hit refresh and we can see that we
now have a hello Udacity written in the
same green color that we set earlier
drawn at the position 50 10 this string
here could be any string and we can use
JavaScript to set it we could also use
fill text instead I'll go ahead save
that now we've got Phil text I'll come
over here and hit refresh and we've got
hello Udacity written in the same blue
color that we set here in addition to
letting us decide what strings to draw
on the page and where to draw them the
canvas 2d context allows us to set a lot
of other options like for instance font
size font style and line width check the
instructor notes for more information</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
