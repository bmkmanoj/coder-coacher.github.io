min-cut has of wanting to pull off these
little elements and the way it does it
is it's going to propose a cut and it
has the traditional measure of cutting a
and B but it's normalized by the
Association within a and the Association
within B and a simple way of thinking
about it is the Association is just sort
of how well connected summed over all of
the nodes within a segment how well
connected those points are so the
problem is is if you have a two segments
and one is very small it's going to have
a very small value and if that
denominator becomes a small value that
whole element becomes very large so even
though the the other element might be a
small size the fact that this one became
small will penalize that a lot so by
doing a this normalization you can end
up with a much better cut of the graph
if you just wanted to do the best end
cut normalized cut that would be
computationally prohibitive but there is
an approximate solution that exists
using what's referred to as the
generalized solving the generalized
eigenvalue problem I'll just show you a
very simple not simple I'll show you a
very high-level description of what goes
on if you want more details you can go
take a look papers or Wikipedia or
anything like that and so here's here's
how it works let's suppose we've got
some matrix W which is the adjacency
matrix so W IJ is just the adjacency
between pixel I and pixel J and then
there's a special matrix this diagonal
matrix that is just what's called the
degree of the node for every vertex how
many other vertexes is are connected to
it right and so in this case it's the
sum so that it's a diagonal matrix so
the degree of pixel I is just the sum of
all the affinities I J summed over all
the J and then what you can show is that
the normalized cut cost can be written
in using this simple expression where
this
vector Y is what's referred to as an
indicator vector so it's a vector that's
got positive ones and negative ones as
to whether remember cutting this into
two parts a and B so it's a positive one
if that point belongs to segment a and
it's a negative constant otherwise all
right so just solve even that for y is
very difficult but what you can do
instead is this is just written out here
we solve this eigenvector equation and
what that'll do is it'll solve for you
for these y's directly but these Y's
they're not going to be binary you know
minus 1 or plus 1 they're going to have
a continuous values and what you then do
is you use that vector in order to solve
for the partitioning and this is related
to spectral partitioning for those of
you familiar with those algorithms and
it's just a not an eigenvalue way of
approximating the solution to this
partitioning because the full solution
would be computationally too difficult</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
