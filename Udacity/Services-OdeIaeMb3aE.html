would put view independent logic at
first services seemed very similar two
controllers both of them provide data to
an application a major difference is
that services are not intended for just
one view a surface is not tied to a
specific controller but can be used by
any number of controllers for example
this user service has information about
the logged in user an account controller
could use the user service to supply
data to its template and there's also
the navigation controller which needs
the user information the user service
can be injected into both controllers
since it's just a source of data and
functionality in our app we might want
data from the menu items to be displayed
in other locations so let's generate a
service to detangle our menu data from
this specific controller and template
then we'll see how we can inject it into
a controller we can generate a service
with the angular generator by running yo
angular service and providing a name for
the service well this should look
familiar since it starts out exactly
like a controller we get our apps module
create a new service with a name and
then provide the function just like with
controllers when we call service on the
module this name and function are being
stored with angular's injector when a
controller Asik's forest service with
this name angular knows where it's
located in how to create it since the
food finder service will be in charge of
all menu information let's move this
data to adjacent file and convert it to
proper Jason will use the food finder
service to fetch this file let's create
a get menu function and use jQuery to
fetch the JSON file so we've extracted
the menu and set up the service now we
just need to hook the service in the
controller together the format to inject
a service into a controller looks a
little odd so let's take it step by step
first I'll highlight the entire function
then I'll copy it and delete it to
inject something into a controller we
need to pass an array of things to
inject so add an array give the names of
the services we want to inject for now
it's just the food finder service then
paste the controller back in the service
is now being injected into the
controller as an argument to use the
service though the controller needs to
store it in a variable
so I'll add a variable with the name
menu here to get the menu we need to
call food finders get menu function
since get menu uses jQuery it returns a
jQuery deferred object similar to a
promise we call then and when our data
gets returned we can set it to this
items since the this keyword is
contextually based this in here isn't
the same as this out here we'll just use
lexical scope to fix this typically the
variable vm for view model is used and
we're still showing the exact same
information but now the data is not tied
to this specific view there's no limit
to the number of services that can be
injected anything that needs to be
injected comes first in the array then
the function that's receiving everything
comes at the end and has variables for
each injected service in the same order</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
