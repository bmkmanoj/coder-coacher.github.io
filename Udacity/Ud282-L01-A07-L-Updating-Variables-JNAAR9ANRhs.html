our variable let's see how we can use it
to keep track of the number of people on
a bus say our bus starts by picking up
five more passengers as the first stop
this basically means we want to add five
to our passengers variable here one
thing we can do with variables is update
it by building on its old value this is
done by writing the variable name and
then an equals sign and then the
variable name again and then plus
whatever value we'll want to add to it
now when you look at that statement like
this it might seem weird at first
how can passengers be equal to
passengers plus five well remember that
this is not a mathematical statement
it's a computer programming statement
more like an instruction or command
we're basically telling the computer to
change the value of passengers to become
the old value plus five the way
computers translate its statements like
this is by signing from the right-hand
side of the equal sign the computer
calculates whatever this right-hand side
is which is the old value plus five and
then sets it into the left-hand side of
the equal sign that's why you should
only have one variable on the left-hand
side of the equal sign here remember
we're not giving the computer a math
puzzle to solve while giving them clear
and precise instructions that is update
passengers to become old passengers plus
five now I assume the bus continues to
go and it's supposed to drop off three
passengers in the next stop so we
basically want to subtract three from
our variable passengers here it's
exactly the same as adding to it we just
type in the variable name equals the
variable name again - whatever value
we'll want to subtract so this would
update the variable passengers setting
it to whatever old value it was minus
three brilliant so now our passengers is
updated and our bus keeps moving on say
at this stop one passenger leaves the
bus and five more hop on what would you
write here to update our passengers
variable to subtract one and add five</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
