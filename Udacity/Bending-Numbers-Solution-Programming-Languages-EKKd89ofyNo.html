to do a few optimizations the very basic
optimizations you can do our very very
simple optimizations on binary
operations on basic arithmetic and the
ones we specifically asked you to do are
these right here as well as replacing
expressions with compa with Constance
when applicable so we gave you this one
right here and then to add in the others
we just do this great big else if
statement so the first one we check that
the operation is times we check that a
is a number and it's a number equal to
one if it is well 1 times anything is
that second thing is be so we just
return b we don't have to wait and run
this through once we're interpreting
that would take more effort than we need
to and we do the same thing with the
next one if B is one and a is something
else we can just return a now we can do
the same thing with addition and 0 we
just check if the operation is equal to
plus and that a is a number and it's a
number equal to 0 then we'll return b if
b is a number equal to 0 then we return
a and finally the last one that we asked
you to implement is a number of minus
itself is 0 so that's fairly
straightforward to check if the
operation is equal to minus and then if
a equals B remember you can do that
because you can check if Python tuples
are equal to each other not just numbers
then we return a tuple of number and 0
to indicate the number 0 in our abstract
syntax tree now the constant folding is
a little bit more work but really not
too much first we check that the first
element of the tuples and be our number
then if the operation is addition if the
operation equals plus then we return
number and second element of a and be
added together so that way we don't have
to run that operation later on when we
are actually running the program
and we can do the same thing if we check
if the operation is minus then we run
then we return tupolev number and the
second element of a and B subtracted and
similarly for multiplication we can just
do the same thing for the second
elements of a and B multiplied together
and then once we have hoped that the
operations have been optimized in some
way we wrap it back up in a binary
operation in a tuple of bin up a op and
B and return that and if none of this
worked if we didn't even get a bit up to
begin with then we just return the
expression because those are all the
optimizations that we have done so let's
try that with a few of these test cases
and these are the test cases that we
provided you with so we have 0 1 &amp;amp; 2
numbers equal to 0.01 point 0 and 2.0
and a few variables that are ancient
kings and queens of persia in Macedonia
Xerxes Darius Antiochus and Musa and
then we're going to define a plus
operation just so we don't have to keep
writing this tuple out a minus operation
at times operation similarly just to
save some keystrokes and then we are
going to check whether an expression
that we've said which is x 2 and 0 is
equal to 0 that is that our optimization
actually ran and we're going to do do
the same thing with a minus operation
and a slightly more complicated
operation question 3 is minus plus 0
plus 1 plus 2 02 that was quite a big
mouthful so let's go through it just a
bit more in depth plus 2 and 0 so 2 plus
0 and then we wrap it in this call to
plus so 2 plus 0 plus 1 and we wrap it
again in a plus 0 and then we wrap all
this up and subtract two from whatever
this is so this really should just be
3-2 once you get rip a stall of the
massive amounts of parentheses so we
print out and make sure that that is
indeed equal to 1 we do the same thing
for these expressions as well so when we
run this we see that we pass all of our
test cases and this our test case is
involved a bunch of
and checking where we just made all of
these up and hand check that this is
what they were supposed to be and then
verified the optimization actually does
what we think it's going to do this
isn't necessarily how you would normally
do it but it's good enough to serve our
purposes right now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
