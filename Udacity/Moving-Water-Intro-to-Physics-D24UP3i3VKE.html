here we have the land here's the sea and
you can see that the sea levels a bit
higher than the level of the land we
have this dike preventing the sea from
overtaking the land and of course we
have this beautiful little windmill
powering this Archimedes screw now it
seems like this is going to be a very
difficult task we have a lot of water to
move to get you starting to think about
just how difficult this task would be I
want you to think about this question
what two factors contribute most to the
difficulty of this task so this windmill
has a lot of work to do what two factors
contribute most maybe the total way of
water or the total amount of water that
we have to lift maybe the cleanliness of
the water is important maybe it's the
distance which I've labeled here is d
that we have to lift the water or maybe
the temperature of the water is the most
important thing or one of the two most
important why don't you choose the best
two answers here and then we can talk
about it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
