to fix certain data points just as much
as you fix the data points originally in
our path the beginning and end point now
I want to fix you
four points these are the corner points
and our data points so in our original
data it's the one over here and one over
here and I want us to be fixed
so they can't move and the very
indicated this in the code is by giving
you a fixed array that looks like this
but each of these numbers corresponds to
exactly one data point there's as many
elements and fix as isn't path and then
when I call smooth I add fix as a
parameter so when you change the
procedure and run it I can tell you you
should be surprised by the output in the
event I ran my procedure it verbatim
copies over the initial path and at the
output we talked about this in a second
but please go ahead and change your
procedure so the output ends up to be
giving you something very much like this
the modification is simple as I go
through my data points I only apply the
update if it's not fixed so if the fixed
flag is not set and then go in here this
is all indented one compared to before
it's a single line change let me tell
you why this doesn't work consider a few
data points like these if you fix this
data point over here then this guy is
perfectly happy with this two neighbors
this is a smooth path so is this guy
over here the only a data point that's
unhappy is the one over here because
it's not part of a very smooth path but
this one is never being updated so as a
result all the other ones stay where
they are they already have the absolute
minimum for smoothness and for the data
fit no updates take change and we are we
don't have the desired result we don't
get a nice round curve the way we wish
to get it to get this we are going to
modify our rule a little bit now and
that's the interesting part for a node
like this with coordinates Xin weii we
add to it with a very small constant
gamma if it will be half or a smooth
weight smoothing constant in a minute
two times the previous guy and of course
that so clicks we have to make sure this
is V cyclic - the guy two steps away and
- oh no
why this makes sense we see when we go
into the opposite direction here we add
a small gamma 2 times this guy over here
- this guy here
- our vision data point and behind this
as a certain desire we want the vector
over here to be the same as the vector
over here this vector is this difference
over here of X I plus 1 over Y I plus 1
minus X I over Y I is this vector over
here and the vector over here is
similarily the difference of the point I
plus 2 - the same for I plus 1 if we set
these to be equal and bring my eye to
the right side then if you modify by eye
in proportion to this expression over
here we reduce the error in fact the
expression in the bracket is the same as
this one called a - this one call it B
so we're looking at the mismatch between
these two vectors and use it to adjust
the X I vector over here which with
those sequentially this one first this
one second in my code a little bit
sloppy because the first update already
influenced the second update but who
cares we're just going to add lines of
code that achieve this over here and
when you do this please make sure that
your update understands the fact that
these indices are cyclic so I did this
in my code and I'm running it an outcome
the following numbers that you can read
over here and these numbers are indeed a
cycle so if we were to plot them and
this is your original data these are the
points we hold constant then the new
data lies on over a very much like this
you can plot them unfortunately I can't
plot them in our environment here but
you could see this now we're not
shifting the racetrack inbound anymore
so please go to your code and modify the
function smooth by adding these new
constraints for the update strength I
suggest you use half of weight smooth
for each update so in total you add
another 0.1 as update strength</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
