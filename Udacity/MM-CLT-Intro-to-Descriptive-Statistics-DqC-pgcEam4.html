the two distributions the population
mean in other words the average number
of blue M&amp;amp;Ms across all of our bags was
eleven point two five the expected value
in other words the mean of all the means
we took from our 50 random samples is
eleven point zero eight notice those are
pretty close they're not exactly the
same but they're not far off the
population standard deviation for all 48
plates or bags plus three point two four
nine hi it's me again
let's recap professor Rogers and
professor Lara ways experiment and then
predict what happened before they tell
us their results so they took a bag of
M&amp;amp;Ms and they calculated the number of
blue M&amp;amp;Ms in that bag so this is the
first bag and they put it on a plate
labeled plate number one and n1
represents the number of blue M&amp;amp;Ms in
that bag or now on that plate and they
did that with a second bag and counted
the number of blue M&amp;amp;Ms and they did
that up to number 48 so they have 48
bags and they dumped each bag onto one
plate so here's our population the
number of blue M&amp;amp;Ms on each plate they
found that the mean is eleven point two
five blue M&amp;amp;Ms and the standard
deviation is three point four nine from
this population professors Laraway and
Rogers randomly selected five plates and
then they counted the number of blue
M&amp;amp;Ms divided by five and got the average
number of blue M&amp;amp;Ms and then they did
this fifty times can you believe it so
then they got fifty sample means so now
let's take a quick quiz according to the
central limit theorem approximately what
should be the mean and standard
deviation of this distribution of sample
means so write your answer here when you
calculate these remember you're
calculating the theoretical probability
which is based on using every possible
sample of size five from this population
but here they're using only 50 samples
of size five there are a lot more but we
can't expect professors Rogers and
Laraway to do that that would really
take forever so calculate the
theoretical me
and standard error based on the central
limit theorem</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
