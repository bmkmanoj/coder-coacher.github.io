entrepreneur and I am super excited
about the tech entrepreneurship
nanodegree because it teaches you how to
become an entrepreneur now what's great
about an entrepreneur and evan has
changed the world they dream they reach
for the stars and then they make it
happen they understand how to get the
world to change now to make the world a
better place and being an entrepreneur
means you can do it yourself you have no
boss just do it and every mistake is
your own mistake now I haven't always
been an entrepreneur I used to be at
Stanford teaching as a computer science
professor actually at tenure which is a
lifetime position so it was very
comfortable at a fantastic University
and at some point I got a little bored
by all this security that I had and
figured I gotta do something bigger than
that and it moved over to a search
engine company called google and I
started Google X self-driving cars
google class a google glass project loon
a whole bunch of projects these are all
crazy projects that i could do a Google
but in Udacity this is my biggest
moonshot so far so we really trying to
change the world now i'm not here to
tell you about my company I'm telling
you here to tell you make your own
company you can duplicate this if you
take this technip relationality you
learn the nuts and bolts how to be
successful and you're going to work many
many mistakes that I have to make
because it's none of you didn't exist
when I started the great thing about
this not agree is that you're going to
build your own stuff you basically build
your own mini company as part of your
training which is you're going to build
a first version of your product you
develop a monetization strategy you get
your first users or customers on board
and we even teach you how to pitch to
potential investors all the stuff we do
in real life now in your tech
entrepreneurship none of the way so
welcome to the not agree and I see you
in class</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
