conditioning is by starting with its
discovery by Ivan Pavlov who was looking
at digestion in dogs actually Pavlov
learned about classical conditioning by
accident here's what happened
Pavlov was actually a physiologist who
was interested in studying digestion and
he used dogs to do so every day he would
come in to his laboratory put a little
bit of meat powder on the dog's tongue
and the dog would automatically salivate
and Pavlov collected that salivation and
analyzed it however one day when Pavlov
came into the lab he saw that the dog
salivated automatically even though it
didn't have any meat powder Pavlov
wondered if perhaps he could be the
reason the dog was salivating and it
turns out he was correct</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
