good reasons to focus on how time scales
with input size rather than absolute
time so the first reason is if we have
an understanding of how the time depends
on the input size well then we can
predict how long it will take before we
actually execute a program if we have to
run the program to figure out how long
it takes well that's not going to be
very useful because we've actually
finished it we've got the result we want
if we only learn how long it takes on
that particular input we haven't learned
anything useful to figure out what it
will cost to run it on some other input
so we want to be able to make
predictions by understanding how the
running time depends on the actual size
of the input the second reason is also
true by understanding how time scales
with input size we get a better idea of
how the cost will change over time
Computers keep getting cheaper and
faster this was observed by Gordon Moore
in 1965 and turned into the notion that
we sometimes called Moore's law today
it's not a law in the sense of a
physical law but is the law in the sense
that the history of computing has
followed this trend where the amount of
computing power you get for the same
cost approximately doubles every 18
months so what you can get for $1000
today is half what you'll be able to get
for $1000 a year and a half from now
that's a pretty nice property to have
but it means that understanding the cost
of something today doesn't tell us very
much what we really want to understand
that is the cost in a more fundamental
way the third reason is also true that
by understanding how time scales with
input size we get a much better
fundamental understanding of our
algorithms than if we just had some
absolute time measurements for a few
different inputs the fourth answer is
not correct abstract answers can be just
as wrong as concrete answers but having
good abstract answers will allow us to
understand things much more deeply than
a few specific concrete answers we'll</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
