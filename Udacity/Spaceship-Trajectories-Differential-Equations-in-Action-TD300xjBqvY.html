try to plot the trajectory of a
spaceship by creating functions for its
acceleration and its trajectory we've
started you out with some helpful
information we've set the step size to
one second told you the mass of the
earth and given you the gravitational
constant which you might recognize as
capital G from the equations in other
videos we've also already created arrays
for you for position and velocity which
right now are filled with zeros in set
the initial position and the initial
velocity of the spacecraft now I'm going
to remind you of some information that
you've already learned that's going to
be especially helpful for this problem
we talked earlier about the equation for
the gravitational force between two
objects that's what this little G here
next to the f 44 stands for gravity this
big G in the equation is this
gravitational constant that we've given
you in the code that's multiplied by the
mass of the Earth and the mass of the
spacecraft and this is divided by the
distance between the Earth and the
spacecraft squared now this D with a hat
over it represents a unit vector that
any given vector has a unit vector
associated with it this unit vector
which is denoted by this hat over top of
it is equal to the original vector
itself divided by that vectors magnitude
so this D with a hat over it up here
shows us that the gravitational force
has this magnitude and is pointing in
this direction which is a line pointing
from the earth out to the spaceship now
if we look back at the code for a second
you'll see that this function that we're
asking you to define is actually for
acceleration not for force but we know
that force and acceleration are very
intimately related by Newton's second
law which is that force equals mass
times acceleration this means in the
case that we're considering right now we
can find the acceleration of the
spaceship by simply taking the equation
for force that we just rode out and
dividing by the mass of the spaceship
which leaves us with this expression
right here your job is to translate this
equation into an expression in Python
for acceleration and then to use that
expression along with the information
we've given you in the forward Euler
method to describe the position and
velocity of the spaceship at any given
time step</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
