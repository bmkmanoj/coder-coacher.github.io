simple version of what's called the
likelihood ratio test and here we're
basically assuming that the cost of
calling a skin pixel not skin is the
same as cost calling a not skin
pixelskin we can reap we can reweighed
these things if the costs are different
likelihood ratio test says basically
look it's just exactly what you think if
the probability that its skin given the
hue measurement is greater than the
probability that it's not skin what am I
going to do I'm gonna call it skin right
that assumes that the costs are equal so
using Bayes rule p of skin given X is
just P of x given skin times P of skin p
of not skin given x is p of x given not
skin times p of not skin so if this
quantity is greater than this whole
quantity we're going to classify excess
skin this is just a direct use of Bayes
rule and as I said before we would
change the weights on two sides of the
equation if the cost of making the
mistakes were not symmetric alright so
problem is I don't really know the prior
of being skinned right I mean I don't
know what where's the prior so the one
thing I'm gonna do is I'm gonna assume
it's a constant I'm assume it has some
number right so the prior for a whole
bunch of pixels that I'm looking at that
are maybe of people or in an office
where there are people around the
probability that something skin is some
number here it's written as Omega so if
you give me enough training data that is
you pay enough undergraduates to circle
all the skin areas in an image or you do
mechanical turk on Amazon to indicate to
have the world out there for a penny and
a half a click to say what skin and
what's not skin you could estimate the
prior that any given pixel is skin so
with this training data I can also
estimate that prior and I can measure
those likelihoods right those are like
the densities those histograms that I
built and remember I need two histograms
I need p of x given skin what are the
hues that I get on the skin and P of x
given not skin all right so with that
same training data that i use for
estimating the prior i can also estimate
my likelihoods all right which means i
can
more or less come up with a rule
basically what i'm going to do is I've
got my priors I've got my likelihood so
I can just evaluate P of X skin given X
and if it's bigger than some number some
theta okay I'm gonna classify this thing
as skin all right that's it given some
new image I want to label all my pixels
and here's a picture this is actually a
picture of Gary Brodsky and the thing on
the right is showing you the probability
of something being skinned and Gary
actually was using this to build a
perceptual user interface where you
could move your head around and the
world that you were looking at in some
virtual rendering would change as you
moved your your head and in fact here's
two more pictures showing you the
orientation right so here it's pretty
much straight up here he's he's turned
his head and all its doing is tracking
the skin pixels of his face that's all
alright and in fact Gary made use of
this in a cool little tracker remember
we talked about mean shift tracking just
recently actually just a couple lectures
ago Gary did sort of a different version
of that called cam shift which was a
maybe little easier to implement
sometimes it's pretty highly cited paper
and it was basically using these color
distributions in order to be able to
track your head and change what was
rendering in fact the picture on here
right comes from his paper where they
were using the quake engine for
controlling a first-person shooter and
if you just turned your head okay the
thing would just move with you okay and
it was just done by by tracking the skin
pixels</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
