doctors Alex and Callie the sea lion
this is Callie Callie can you wave hi
good can you wave it with the other hand
good good
here at Moss Landing marine laboratories
where we run a teaching aquarium for
students
he's salute that from all over the world
the beginning of the foundation of the
relationship that I have with Callie is
basic obedience water so I can put her
into the water when I ask hold I can ask
her to wait there patiently for me and
the reason that she's willing to do
these things is because of the
reinforcement history of operant
conditioning that I have used to form
these basic behaviors the second basic
behavior that I use all the time
is one of the basic operant training
techniques and it's called
targeting this is a nose target and
Callie is trained to put her nose to my
hand wherever I put my hand
Callie's nose is going to go back and
she stops targeting when she hears that
sound that I make which is called a
bridge a bridge is a stimulus that tells
the animal they've done something
correctly and reinforcement is coming
there's a type of secondary reinforcer a
conditioned reinforcer which helps the
animal understand the reinforcement is
on its way without having to deliver the
reinforcement at that very second Callie
is receiving a variety of different
types of reinforcers that right there is
an ice cube which she's been conditioned
to like and we've conditioned her to
like it by association with other things
that she already likes including the
fish and then there's also her
relationship with me this is tactile
reinforcement that she has to be trained
to enjoy yes don't stop one of the
things that comes from being associated
with reinforcement for a long period of
time is the relationship through
so go conditioning by associating myself
with all good experiences for her I have
a strong value to her I have more value
than the food has and we're
demonstrating that right now because the
food is over there and she and I are
right here together
that's what can be formed with a long
history of partnership yes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
