the so called harder prefetching where
the program doesn't change and the
hardware itself
either the processor or the cache is
trying to guess what will be accessed
soon there are a number of hardware
prefetcher
that work reasonably well for example
many current processors include what's
called a stream buffer prefetcher other
popular types of pre features include a
stride prefetcher and what is called a
correlating prefetcher all of these try
to guess what is going to be accessed
next based on some sort of locality
property so a stream buffer is
sequential in nature it's trying to see
whether once we access a block and then
the next block that follows it we are
likely to access the next next block and
so on so it's just trying to fetch
several blocks in advance in order to
not be too late
a stride based prefetcher is monitoring
accesses to see if memory accesses that
we are doing are at a fixed distance
from each other so if their address is
differ by the same amount it's gonna
guess that we will just continue doing
that and it starts prefetching with a
distance of D times something and it
determines how many of these in advance
such that it's just in time a
correlating prefetcher is trying to
predict sequences of accesses that are
not sequential or at the same distance
from each other the way does this is
when we see a and then be accessed it
remembers in some sort of a table that
when a comes then becomes then when C
comes it remember that after becomes C
and so on and then later on if we see a
it's gonna look here and issue a
prefetch for B if we do access B it's
gonna look here and issue a prefetch for
C and so on so it can prefetch an
arbitrary sequence of accesses as long
as that sequence repeats so it's very
good for example for link lists which
are not necessarily sequential in memory
and they're not at fixed strides but if
you access the first note that the
second
turn note and then you do that again
it's gonna prefetch correctly</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
