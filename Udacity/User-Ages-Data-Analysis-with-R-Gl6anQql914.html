let's start by using the Q plot function
we'll pass it the variable age and our
data set is pseudo Facebook so P F and
I'm gonna add some color using the color
and fill parameters running this code we
see we get our histogram now you might
have tried a variety of bin widths and
in this case I think I've been with the
one is the best so let's add that in
here I chose have been width of 1 since
1 makes sense since we're going by years
or ages this gives me a histogram of
counts of users by individual years so I
can get a finer view of the data for say
like 25 years old by setting the bin
width equal to 1 it allows us to more
easily spot unusual spikes in our data
points like here here and definitely out
here let's zoom in on this plot and take
a closer look I see the largest spikes
in the mid to late 20s and we don't have
any users were put in an age lower than
13 at the left of the histogram this
makes sense because users must be at
least 13 years old to set up a Facebook
account now there's also some unusual
spikes above a hundred but my guess is
that some users may be exaggerating
their age do you have any friends that
are 100 years or older on Facebook I
know I certainly don't and one final
comment that I want to make is that your
x-axis might look slightly different
than mine remember that we can use scale
X discrete or scale X continuous to
change this appearance so adding scale X
discrete here I can set the breaks so
that way they run from 0 to 113 and they
increment every 5 units or every 5 years
now you might be wondering why I chose
113 here and I have a simple answer for
you I just used the maximum age in our
user data set remember I can find that
out by running summary on that variable
so I can see the minimum age is 13 and
the maximum age is a hundred and
thirteen</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
