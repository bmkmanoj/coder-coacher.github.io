patterns with MapReduce we've talked
about filtering patterns summarizing
patterns and structural patterns but
what good are they well these patterns
can be thought of as sort of lenses to
try and view your problems through if
you have a big data problem and you're
trying to do some analysis that at its
heart is really about filtering about
selecting from a large data set and
getting some smaller sample of that data
set there's a good chance that you can
use this filtering pattern likewise if
the fundamental nature of your of your
problem is summarizing or going from a
structured to hierarchical sort of
database in fact these aren't all the
patterns you might want to use there's
also organizational patterns there's
patterns that deal with input and output
and there's others but getting yourself
to ask this question can use help to say
is this problem I'm dealing with
filtering or summarizing or structural
or something else that isn't simple in
fact just identifying when MapReduce is
the appropriate tool for a problem is a
large part of what it means to be a
MapReduce expert and gaining this
expertise takes practice this practice
can come naturally in a job environment
or you could choose to make it happen
deliberately by seeking out problems and
trying to solve them but if you enjoy
learning about and thinking about these
patterns you should check out that book
I mentioned earlier MapReduce design
patterns and you can learn more there
but now it's time to try implementing
some of these patterns in a sort of
novel setting</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
