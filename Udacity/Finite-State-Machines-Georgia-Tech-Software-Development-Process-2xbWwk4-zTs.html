very well known one choose finite state
machines and you might have seen them
before at a high level a state machine
is a graph in which nodes represent
states of the system for example in this
case state 1 state 2 and state 3 edges
represent transitions between states for
instance in this case we have one edge
from state 1 to state 2 and that means
that the system can go from state 1 to
state 2 and finally the labels on the
edges represent events and actions for
example what this label means is that
the system goes from state 3 to stay to
when event 5 occurs and when going from
state 3 Tuesday 2 it generates action 4
and there's richer models Richards kind
of state machines but we're just gonna
stick to these ones which are enough for
our purpose so how do we build such an
final state machine starting from a
specification the first thing we need to
do is to identify the system boundaries
and the input and output to the system
once we have done that we can identify
within the boundaries of a system the
relevant states and transitions so we
split this single state we refine it
into several states and we also identify
how the system can go from one state to
another including which inputs cause
which transition and which result in
outputs we can obtain to better
illustrate that let's look at a concrete
example</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
