the course we turn our attention to the
study of polynomial algorithms first
however a little perspective in the
beginning of the course we define the
general notion of a language then we
began to distinguish between decidable
languages and undecidable ones remember
that there were uncountably many
undecidable ones but only a countably
many decidable ones in comparison and
the decidable ones should be
infinitesimally small but I'll give them
this big circle here anyway because
they're so interesting to us in the
section of the course on complexity we
considered several subclasses of the
decidable languages P which consists of
those languages decidable in polynomial
time NP which consists of those
languages that can be verified in
polynomial time and within this we have
this little band of np-complete problems
which are the hardest problems in NP if
any one of these turned out to be
polynomial then P would expand and
swallow all of NP or equivalently we can
think of NP collapsing down into this
class P in this section we're going to
focus on this class P the set of
polynomials aidable languages the
overall tone here will hopefully feel a
little more optimistic in the previous
sections of the course many of our
results were of a negative nature no you
can't decide that language or no that
problem isn't tractable unless P is
equal to NP here the results will be
entirely positive no longer will we be
excluding problems from a good class
we'll just be showing that problems are
in this good class P yes you can do that
in polynomial time or it's even a low
order polynomial and we can solve huge
instances in practice</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
