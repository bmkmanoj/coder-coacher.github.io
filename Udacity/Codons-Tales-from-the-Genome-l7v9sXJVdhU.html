that we could pick up on from the
genetic code here the first is that some
amino acids are coded by multiple codons
and the answer to the last exercise we
sort of explored this a little bit and
see that alanine is coded by GC u GC c
GC a GC g and this happens for some of
the other amino acids as well another
feature is that some amino acids only
have one codon that codes for them for
example tryptophan just has ug g another
feature is that some codons have special
functions for example we see three
appear UAA UAG and UGA code for stop
codons there's no amino acid and it
seems to signal the stop for translation
and over here we have one codon that
seems to code for an amino acid
methionine but it's also representative
of the start it appears that there's a
start codon this Aug
because this start codon is necessary to
start protein synthesis for translation
this is the codon that tells the
ribosome where to start
alternatively these stop codons are
essentially signals that tell the
ribosome where to stop so now using the
genetic code here I want to see if you
can find the start codon the stop codon
and the codon the codes for alanine or
ala in this following mRNA sequence
there are three codons to choose from a
uggh and UGA and for each of these
options start I want you to pick one of
these three checkboxes that corresponds
with one of these codons if you have
trouble reading this genetic code right
here just look in the instructors notes
anytime you have to use the genetic code
and I'll always give it to you for any
question just look in the instructors
notes and there'll be a link right there
you can also download it keep it to
yourself you can google image search
other genetic codes if you're interested
in seeing them but go ahead and use the
information here to see if you can
answer this question and select the
correct codon for start/stop and alanine</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
