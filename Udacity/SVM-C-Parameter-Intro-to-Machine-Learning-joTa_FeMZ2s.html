is the C parameter so what does C do it
controls the trade-off between a smooth
decision boundary and one that
classifies all the training points
correctly so let's suppose that our data
looks like this and just like we saw
with gamma there's a number of different
completely valid decision boundaries
that you can draw in here you could draw
something that might be very straight
but it comes at the cost of a few points
being misclassified you could also draw
in something that's considerably more
Wiggly but where you get potentially all
of the training points correct of course
the trade-off of having something that's
very intricate very complicated like
this is the chances are it's not going
to generalize quite as well to your test
set so something that's a little bit
straighter a little bit more
straightforward may be actually the
better choice once you start looking at
the accuracy on your test set so here's
a quiz for you it's a little bit tricky
because you'll have to go to the SK
learn documentation or potentially to
play around with some code on your own
to come up with the answer and the
question is let's say you have a large
value of C does that mean you're going
to get a smooth boundary or that you'll
get more training points correct there's
going to be a trade off again to answer
this quiz you're going to want to go to
Google or potentially to the SK learn
documentation for those of you who are
more adventurous or who like to go
directly to the code to figure these
things out you can certainly play around
with some code that will help you
visualize this one way you can do that
is you can go back to the previous
lesson the naive Bayes lesson where you
were drawing some decision boundaries
that you could actually visualize in the
Udacity interpreter and instead of
running those with naive Bayes of course
you can just run them with an SVM and
play around with different values of C
and use that to answer the question if
you do that just a protip use the RBF
kernel because this is where you'll
actually see a big difference based on
the value of C that you use</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
