thanks with the what's on tap for today
well as you can see on your screen today
we are going to talk about support
vector machines and at the end of it
we're going to circle back to boosting
so that I can try to explain to you why
it doesn't seem to overfit as much as
you might think or at least not in the
ways that you might think ooh that would
be cool I was worried that that maybe
was a command what was a command the
thing that you wrote on the screen Oh to
support back man that you know reminds
me one of my favorite little things
about police that any combination of the
word police is illegal since I see so
police police police police police
police police police police police
police police police police police
police those are all legal sentences all
right well please stop oh man this is
why I hang out with you Michael okay so
today we're going to talk about support
vector machines and I'm going to do
something unexpected and I'm going to
start out the beginning of this with a
quiz yes with the quiz so here's the
quiz for you Michael I've drawn on here
some points
so I'm labeled positive and some labeled
minus representing two different classes
and you'll notice that you could draw a
line to separate them therefore they are
linearly separable exactly so the
question I have for you is simply this
which is the best line and here's how
I'm going to show me here's how you're
going to show them I'm not going to ask
you to just draw some random line
because that's too hard for us to give
feedback on so instead what I've done is
I've drawn three green dots here on the
sort of upper left and three red drops
here on the bottom right and what I want
you to do is select one of the green
dots and one of the red dots and since
you'll have two dots that will define a
line and that'll be the way you indicate
to me which of the lines is in fact the
best line the best line the best line
and I'm not going to tell you what best
means you tell me what best means when
you justify why you would choose one
over the other if I think they're all
the best I can choose any one I want
that's right okay so you got it I think
so okay go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
