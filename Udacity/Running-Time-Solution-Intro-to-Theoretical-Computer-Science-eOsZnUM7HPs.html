because it has smaller numbers so maybe
that's a bit easier to reason about now
as we grow the input size notice that
we're growing the input size linearly
and as we grow it linearly the time it
takes beta also grows of relatively
linearly so we double from 100 to 200 we
roughly double and as we triple from 100
to 300 well we get roughly triple of the
initial input size 16 is pretty close to
18 so I'm going to go ahead and say that
beta is linear now alpha just explodes
right at 100 well it doesn't take a
whole lot of time in fact it takes quite
a bit less time than gamma but at N
equals 200 alpha is already in the
hundreds of thousands and then it gets
even bigger and bigger very very quickly
so I think it's reasonable to say that
alpha has an exponential running time
now gamma might be a little trickier to
see but i think if we look at the input
sizes relative to the running times in
gamma we can see that it looks to be
polynomial now to see this let's take a
look at N squared for these input sizes
n squared for a hundred is 10 to the
fourth which is quite a bit bigger than
gammas running time n squared for 200 is
similarly much bigger than gammas
running time and on and on and n squared
is really the lowest polynomial running
time you are probably going to get that
isn't linear and it definitely dominates
gamma at least for the instances that
we're looking at so I would definitely
say that gamma is polynomial in running
time for a more visual representation of
this let's draw a few graphs let's take
a look at alpha first now alpha is still
very tiny at N equals on hunt 100 and
relative to this graph it's still very
tiny here here it's quite a bit bigger
but it's still compared to 10 to the
13th 10 to the 9th is actually pretty
small and then its way up here for N
equals 400
let's just kind of draw an approximation
to that this is not to scale but it'll
give you an idea for the shape of the
graph which is really what we're going
for for bed in gaming we really just
can't see them on this graph they're so
close to the x-axis here that they might
as well just be right on top of it so
that doesn't really help us so clearly
alpha is growing just unbelievably
faster than both beta and gamma so let's
zoom in a bit and look at this again all
right so now we're only going up to 10
to the fourth so that makes gamma fairly
easier to draw at N equals on 100 it's
still pretty small at 200 it sits closer
and at 300 it's about halfway there and
then it gets about here so let's go
ahead and draw that if we try to draw
beta we're still right about here so it
still grows much much slower than gamma
does so you can see that they're really
in different classes because they're
both just growing so much slower than
alpha is but beta similarly is growing
just so much slower than gamma is so
they're definitely in different classes
and this is kind of a visual intuitive
representation of y alpha is exponential
gamma is polynomial and beta is linear</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
