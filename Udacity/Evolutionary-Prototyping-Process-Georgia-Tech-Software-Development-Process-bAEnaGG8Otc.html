is evolutionary prototyping which works
in four main phases we start from an
initial concept then we design and
implement a prototype based on this
initial concept we refine the prototype
until it is acceptable and finally we
complete and release the prototype
therefore when developing a system using
evolutionary prototyping the system is
continually refined and rebuilt so it is
an ideal process when not all
requirements are well understood which
is a very common situation so looking at
this in a little more detail what
happens is that developers start by
developing the parts of the system that
they understand instead of working on
developing a whole system including part
that might not be very clear at that
stage the partial system is then shown
to the customer and the customer
feedback is used to drive the next
iteration in which either changes are
made to the current features or new
features are added so either the current
prototype is improved or the prototype
is extended and finally when the
customer agrees that the prototype is
good enough the developers will complete
the remaining work on the system and
release the prototype as the final
product so let's discuss as we did for
the previous process models what are the
main advantages and disadvantages of
illusionary prototyping in this case the
main advantage is the immediate feedback
developers get feedback immediately as
soon as they produce a prototype and
they show it to the customer and
therefore the risk of implementing the
wrong system is minimized the main
negative is the fact that it's difficult
to plan when using evolutionary
prototype it is difficult to plan in
advance how long the development is
going to take because we don't know how
many iterations will be needed and
another drawback is that it can easily
become an excuse to do kind of code and
fix kind of approaches in which we hack
something together fix the main issues
when the customer gives us feedback and
then continue this way until the final
product is something that is kind of
working but it's not really product of
high quality something else I want to
point out before we move to the next
software process model is that there are
many different kinds of prototyping so
evolutionary prototyping is just one of
them for example throwaway prototyping
is another kind of prototyping in which
the prototype is just used to gather
requirements but is thrown away at the
end of the requirements gathering
instead of being evolved as it happens
