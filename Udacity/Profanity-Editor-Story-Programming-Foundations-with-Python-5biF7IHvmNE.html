my boss sent out an email to everyone in
the company asking for volunteers to
help him proofread some marketing
documents since I had some time
available I'd applied by saying I can
take a shot at it or at least that is
what I wanted to say i misspelled one
keyword in that sentence and instead
wrote something really embarrassing why
do the eye and Okies have to be so close
to each other on my keyboard I was so
embarrassed I wish my spell checker
caught curse words to alert clumsy
writers like myself let's write a
program that detects curse words in a
text but before we do that let me ask
you have you ever been in a situation
like this have you ever sent or received
the message that you felt was
embarrassing if so we would love to hear
about it you can share your experience
with us on the discussion forum check
this box after you've submitted your
stories</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
