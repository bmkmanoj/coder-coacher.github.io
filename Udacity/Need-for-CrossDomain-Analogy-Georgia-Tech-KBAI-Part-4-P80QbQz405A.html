between a target problem and a source
case in different domains let us look at
another example let us suppose it is a
patient who is a tumor in his stomach
there is a physician who has a laser gun
she knows that if the laser light were
to shine on this tumor the tumor will be
killed and the patient will be cured but
a physician has a problem the laser
light is so strong that will also tell
all the healthy tissue on its way to the
tumor and thereby killing the patient
what should the physician do this is
actually a very famous problem in
cognitive science it was first used by a
psychologist called dunker around 1926
or what do you think the physician
should do in this situation take a
moment and think about it
you
we returned to the physician and the
patient example in just a minute first
let me tell you another story once there
was a kingdom ruled by a ruthless King
there was a rebel army approaching the
fortress in which the King lived but it
was a problem the king's men had mind
all the roads approaching the foot as a
result if an army was to walk up with
the roads your minds would go off and
his soldiers would be killed so what did
the army decide to do the army decided
to decompose itself into smaller groups
so that each group could come from a
different Road and reach the fort at the
same time because each group was small
enough the mines on the roads did not go
off the soldiers were able to attack
before at the same time and overthrow
the bad King now let us go back to the
problem of the physician and the patient
what do you think now has your answer to
the problem changed some of you indeed
may have change your answer because of
this story I told you about the king and
the rebel army one solution of this
problem is the definition we divide a
very intense laser beam into several
smaller less intense beams as his beams
come from different directions they do
not harm the healthy tissue however you
recently tumor at the same time and
managed to kill the tumor you will note
that this is an example of cross domain
and our lodging here the target problem
had to do with the physician and the
patient this source case had to do with
the king and the rebel army the
obviously two situations were clearly
very different in one case we had a
physician and the patient the laser beam
and the tumor and under the case we had
a king and the rebel army default and
the mines but some of the relationships
were very similar
and captured in the fourth case we had a
resource the army which was decomposed
into several small armies which was sent
to the goal location at the same time we
took this pattern we took this strategy
abstracted it out and then applied it to
the patient and physician example the
physician used the same strategy do
resource decompose it into several
smaller resources and center the goal at
the same time now you can also see why
the ant climbing a wall is similar to a
woman climbing a ladder the objects are
different and and wall woman a ladder
but the relationship is similar climbing
up and cross domain analogies then the
objects and the features and the values
of the objects can be different this
similarity is based on the relationship
it is a relationship that is important
it is a relationship that gets
transferred from the source case to the
target problem</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
