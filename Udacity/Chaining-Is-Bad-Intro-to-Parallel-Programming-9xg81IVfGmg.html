behave in a parallel setting for
construction that means we have many
items to put into the hash table one per
thread for lookup that means we have
many keys to lookup in the hash table
again one per thread and chaining has
two main disadvantages number one let's
say we're looking up many items one per
thread and we know to look up one item
we calculate the hash function for that
item that paralyzes nicely it's just a
map operation more problematic however
is searching the linked list in the
bucket so we have a number of threads
here each thread ends up looking in a
different bucket this particular bucket
has three items the bucket for thread
two has two items but the bucket for
thread one has many many many items some
threads like thread two might find their
item right away
some threads like thread one for
instance might have to visit many or
even all the items in a lengthy linked
list before finding its item because
threads within a warp run in lockstep
the runtime of a warp is completely
dependent on the slowest lookup within
the warp the other threads in the warp
have to wait until the slowest item is
found and this behavior as you might
imagine is bad</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
