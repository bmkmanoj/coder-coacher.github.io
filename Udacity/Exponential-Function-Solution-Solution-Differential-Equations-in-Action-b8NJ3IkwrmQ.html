has to be 5 look at this term if x
equals zero we have e to the power of 0
which is one to turn that into 5 this
has to be five in the other box we need
2-3 this is easy to see if you know
about the chain rule the inner
derivative provides us with that factor
of minus three which we need if you
don't know the chain rule you can argue
as follows we start with e to the power
of x the standard exponential function
next let's form e to the power of minus
X which means to flip that blue curve
along the y axis to compute e to the
minus X for a specific value of x we can
compute e to the X 4 minus that value of
x so we're mirroring the blue curve to
get the green curve this additional
factor of 3 accelerates the green curve
e to the power of minus 3x is three
times as fast if you will as e to the
power of minus X to compute e to the
power of minus 3x for this X we can
compute e to the power of minus X for
three times that X and now look at the
derivatives by going from the blue curve
the regular exponential function to the
green curve we are changing the sign of
the derivative here the derivative is
positive now it's negative all of the
time and with that additional factor of
three and the exponent you're boosting
the derivative by a factor of three
we'll get these triangles the horizontal
leg of this slope triangle is reduced by
a factor of three meaning that the slope
increases by a factor of three</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
