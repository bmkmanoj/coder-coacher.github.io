that JavaScript token in lexical
analysis now we need to know how to
handle that special JavaScript token
type when we're parsing just to review a
bit this is how we did basic HTML
parsing or a basic HTML grammar we say
it's a parsing rule with p underscore
this is the kind of thing we're trying
to parse an element and then we write
down here the rule from the grammar and
where we would normally write an arrow
they ask us to write a colon so element
can be rewritten to word and then p 0 is
the final parse tree and p1 is the child
parse tree and we build the final parse
tree out of the child parse tree growing
a bigger tree over time well actually
our handling of javascript elements is
very similar we just indicate that an
HTML element can consist of a JavaScript
token and we build up our parse tree by
noting that it's a JavaScript token and
then including the text and you see this
word here javascript in all capital
letters back here when we were lexing
the JavaScript token we said token type
is JavaScript and all capital letters
those intentionally match this is the
linkage we're making between the lexer
and the parser in fact they have to
match otherwise it won't work so let me
show you a concrete example let's say my
HTML input is hello my and then there's
some JavaScript which says document
right 99 and then lift bunnell let me
show you what the abstract syntax tree
what the parse tree will look like for
this will recall that HTML is a list of
elements and here we have four elements
1 2 3 4 the first is the word element
hello the next is the word element my
the next is the javascript element
containing only the important text not
all of this tag stuff and the last is
the word element left alone this is the
parse tree a list of HTML elements it
just so happens that none of these are
nested but they could have been if there
were some tags in here and here 99
luftballons is perhaps more commonly
known as in english as 99 red balloons
it was a protest song in german written
around 1983 here are clearly 99 entire
lunes it must be that the other 95 are
just behind this one exactly covered by
it you believe me don't you you totally
don't</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
