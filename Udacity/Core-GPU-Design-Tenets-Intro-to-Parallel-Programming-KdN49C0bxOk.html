characterize the decisions that GPU
designers have made one GPUs have lots
of simple compute units that together
can perform a large amount of
computation in general the GPU is
willing to trade off control for compute
they choose simpler control complexity
and more compute power the consequence
of this decision is that the GPU
programming model the programmers view
of the machine is perhaps more
restrictive than the CPUs two GPUs have
an explicitly parallel programming model
when we write programs for this machine
we know that we have lots of processors
and we have to program it in that way we
don't pretend that it has one processor
and rely on a magic compiler chain to
figure out how to map work on to many
processors this programming model is a
main focus of the class we'll talk a lot
more about this and three GPUs optimized
for throughput not latency they are
willing to accept increased latency of
any single individual computation in
exchange for more computation being
performed per second consequently
they're well suited for application
domains where throughput is the most
important metric</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
