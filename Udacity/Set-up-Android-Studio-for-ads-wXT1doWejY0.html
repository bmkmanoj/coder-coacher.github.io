interstitial ad in Android studio and
for this i'll be using the amazon mobile
ads API which i've downloaded from their
developer site if you still need to
download that api please refer back to
our reading node for instructions
otherwise follow along with my code and
will test our end result together so
I've opened Android studio and titled a
new project name my interstitial ad you
can name yours whatever you want but
keep in mind that it's always good to
have a clear and descriptive name then
let's create a new blank activity and
I'll name it interstitial ad activity ok
great and we can see we have a few bare
bones things in here already we have our
xml layout file here and our
interstitial ad activity the most
important method to us here is going to
be our oncreate method which sets our
view up so that we can display our
interstitial ad so I've copied this draw
file and pasted it into our project in
the Java lives full der then we need to
click it and say add is library now we
should be able to open it and we can see
all the classes and interfaces that we
have access to like add layout and
listener and also interstitial ad we
also needed to add a couple lines of
code to our androidmanifest.xml file so
let's take a look at that inside our
applications tag I've added lines that
reference Amazon's add activity package
an outside of the application tag you
can see that I've also declared the
permissions we need to use which let us
use the internet to retrieve ads I've
also added these extra ones that allow
us to get the users locational data
these can be useful if you want to
target ads to specific location so make
sure you've changed your Android
manifest and included your library and
now let's dive into our Java code to
make an interstitial ad</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
