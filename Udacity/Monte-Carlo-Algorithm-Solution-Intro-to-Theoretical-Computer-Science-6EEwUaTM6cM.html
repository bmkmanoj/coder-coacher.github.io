produces the best possible solution with
probability 1/2 and we run it a couple
of times then what happens if we run it
the first time we can be 50% sure that
we already have the best possible answer
then we run it again so the probability
in the second run is again 1/2 that we
do not get the best possible answer and
in the third run it's again 1/2 and so
on now this is the probability of
getting a suboptimal solution and of
course if we want to be 99.9% sure that
we get the best possible solution the
probability of getting a suboptimal
solution should be smaller than 0.1% and
then the problem becomes 1/2 over N and
n is the number of times that we run
this algorithm here should be smaller
than 0.001 which is the same as 0.1% and
then you can just solve for n and get
the answer and we have to run this
algorithm just ten times which is pretty
neat now of course for an np-complete
problem it's very unlikely that we get a
probability like this because as you can
see we could very very very quickly in
polynomial time get a solution that is
almost guaranteed to be optimal so what
you will find for most Monte Carlo
algorithms for challenging problems is
that the probability here
first of all becomes sometimes even
exponentially small and second that it
also depends on the input size but we'll
soon see how that works out concretely</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
