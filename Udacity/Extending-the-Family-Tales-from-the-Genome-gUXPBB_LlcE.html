was looking for a parent or sibling
through a genome match now when they be
looking for somebody who they share
fifty percent IBS with actually no
remember that an IBS score for a
parent-child relationship is already
much higher somewhere around eighty five
percent oh yeah the fifty percent number
is referring to actually the shared
segments the shared snv single
nucleotide variants between a parent and
a child so for example we would be able
to lay the chromosome side by side and
see that an apparent in a child they
shared the snv's all along the whole
length of the chromosome whereas a
sibling relationship you would share
regions of chromosomes that are shared
snv's but not the whole length of the
chromosome that's really cool but where
can I actually line these two up well
you can actually do this on the 23 Emmy
website they have an ancestry tool that
allows you to select individuals that
you've shared your genome with and you
can lay the chromosome side by side and
you can see exactly which segments you
share with another individual it's
awesome so we're not just looking at the
percent more related to somebody but
we're actually seeing what portions of
our genetic information we share with
someone exactly that's exactly what it
is now these shared regions of descent
actually represent the percentage
relation we are to each other if you
share fifty percent of these reasons
you're fifty percent related and we call
this identity by descent or IBD okay so
I get this whole parent-child relations
thing but what about beyond that what if
I share 25% IBD with someone what does
that mean well let me ask you which of
the following family relationships do
you think would share 25% relatedness
with you go ahead and check all that
