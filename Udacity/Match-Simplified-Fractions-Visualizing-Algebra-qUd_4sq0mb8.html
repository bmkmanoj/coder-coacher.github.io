3 and 9 is the same thing as 3 times 3 I
can reduce an equivalent of one 3/3
makes one so i have two thirds so let's
see two thirds that would be e alright
for four and 12 I know four goes into
four and four goes into 12 so I'm going
to have four times 1 and four times
three here I have 4/4 I know these are
factors that appear in both the
numerator and the denominator so I could
reduce these 2 1 1 times 1 is 1 1 times
3 is 3 so one-third let's see one third
would be d 4 915 i divided 9 and 15 by
three so I know nine is the same thing
as 3 times 3 15 is 3 times 5 again I
have an equivalent of 13 divided three
mix one so i'm left with three fifths
three-fifths would be answer choice see
i have three pieces out of 5 for 10 12
so i'm going to divide them both by two
I know 10 divided by two is five and 12
divided by two is six I didn't show the
work here but I was just factoring out
to over two so I get answer choice B I
have five out of six pieces for 9-12 i'm
going to write 9 as 3 times 3 and 12 s 3
times 4 again i have the 3/3 which makes
one so i get three fourths three-fourths
would be f and finally i have 8 / 24
this one might have been a little tricky
I can think of eight as 2 times 4 and 24
as six times for notice i have 4 divided
by four so i can cancel those to make
one and then i have 2 times 1 which is 2
and 6 times 1 which is 626 but i can
still simplify this fraction I know 2
can be written as 2 times 1 and 6 can be
written as 2 times 3 2/2 makes one so I
get one third hmm that seemed like a lot
of math i could have probably gotten to
this answer quicker I know my answer
choice should be d but let's see how I
could have done it faster notice how I
canceled a 4 over 4 and a 2 over 2 well
really that would've been the same thing
as 4 times 2 which is 8 and 4 times 2
which is eight I would have had an eight
in the numerator and an eighth in the
denominator let me show you what
that would look like I would have
written eight as 1 times 8 and 24 as 3
times 8 notice 8/8 makes one because
they're common factors in the numerator
and denominator and i have 1 over 3 or
one-third notice if i take out the
largest number in both the numerator and
the denominator i get to my answer more
quickly usually that's what we want to
do when we simplify that's why it's
helpful to know factors of a number</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
