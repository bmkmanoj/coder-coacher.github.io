results in our observed data what
confidence can we have the beta
parameter we captured is the true value
the answer is it turns out it depends on
how much data we have to understand why
this is let's consider the following
imagine that the graph on the left and
the right are going to show the PDF for
a random variable X let's suppose the
one on the left looks like this and the
one on the right looks like this we can
ask the question what's the probability
that the random variable X will be
greater than a value T for the graph on
the right more of the probability mass
is over on the right side so it's not
surprising that the probability that x
is greater than T is larger for the
graph on the right than the one on the
left there is an inequality called
Markov inequality which quantifies this
notion specifically Marcos and quality
says that for any random variable X the
probability that it is greater than T is
less than or equal to its expectation
divided by the number T now for the
derivation of this please see a link in
the instructors notes now this becomes
really interesting when you substitute X
with X minus mu meaning the mean value
of x that is you can think of this
quantity here on the right as exes
deviation from its mean value when you
take this and substitute it into markups
equality it then becomes something
called chebyshev's inequality
chebyshev's inequality says that the
probability that X deviates from its
mean value by an amount T is bounded by
an expression described by its variance
and T this is actually really amazing
and quantifies exactly the concept that
we've been intuitively talking about it
says the probability that X deviates
from its mean is directly related to its
variance and it's true for any random
variable at all now here's where we get
back into thinking about our beta
parameter from our exponential fit
recall that if you have a bunch of data
points x1 through xn and you suspect
that they might be fit by an exponential
distribution the maximum likelihood
estimation method says the way we get
the beta parameter for that exponential
distribution is to take the average of
the values we've collected now x bar
itself is a random variable and so we
can reason about how much does the x bar
that we
calculated deviate from the true beta
value and let's denote the actual beta
value with a beta star now to calculate
this we can just directly use
chebyshev's inequality now all we're
doing is we're substituting X bar minus
beta star with X if we do that we have
this expression the probability of X bar
minus beta star is greater than epsilon
is less than or equal to the variance of
X bar divided by epsilon squared and
that number turns out to be less than
1/4 n epsilon squared</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
