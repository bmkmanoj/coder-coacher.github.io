deal with visuospatial knowledge in fact
in your products they've already come
across some of them so imagine there is
a figure here here is a triangle with
the FX facing to the right it is another
triangle with the FX facing to the left
so in one view the AI agent can extract
propositional representations out of
figures like this and similarly
propositional representations out of
figure like this so this is the
propositional representation this is a
propositional representation and then
the AI agent can work on these
propositional representations to produce
new propositional representations so
some air agent can use a logic engine or
a production rule to say that this
particular triangle which was rotated 90
degrees has now been ordered to 270
degrees so although the input was in the
formulas figures the action here was at
the level of propositional
representations of these figures the
agent may extract bubbles two
representations like this through image
processing through image segmentation
perhaps using some techniques like
constraint propagation as well
alternatively the agent may have
analogical representations and is
analogical representations it is a
structural correspondence between the
representation and the external figure
so the external world had a triangle
like this and the analogical
representation will also have a triangle
like this notice I am using
terminological representation which is a
separate thing form analogical reasoning
we are not talking about analogical
reasoning right now we are talking about
an analogical representation and
analogical representation is one which
has some structural correspondence with
the external world that is being
represented given such an analogical
representation then I might run affine
transformations or set transformations
to get this so I may say that I got this
triangle out of that one simply by the
operation of reflection or rotation so
this propositional representations in
the previous view are a model they are
separated from divorced from the
perceptual modality these analogical
representations on the other hand of
modal representations they are very
close to the perceptual modality and
human cognition mental imagery appears
to use analogical representations
would be an equivalent theory of
computational imagery human cognition is
very good at using both propositional
representations and analogical
representations computers however we are
not yet good at using analogical
representations most computers most of
the time use only propositional
representations the same kind of
analysis may apply to other perceptual
modalities not just to visual images so
here are two measures and we can either
extract proposed representations out of
them and that analyze whose
propositional representations or we
could think directly over the
relationship we need two particular
measures there is a question for
building theories of human cognition
when you're driving a car and you listen
to a melody on your radio and you're
reminded of something reminded of a
similar melody that you had heard
earlier what exactly is happening are
you extracting a purposeful presentation
out of the melody that you just heard
and in the propositional representation
reminds you of the propositional
representation for a previously heard
melody or does the new melody somehow
directly remind you of a previously
heard melody without any intermediate
purposeful representation these are all
open issues in cognitive science as well
as an knowledge-based AI in cognitive
science it is by now significant
agreement that human cognition does use
mental imagery at least with virtual
images but we don't know how to do
mental imagery in computers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
