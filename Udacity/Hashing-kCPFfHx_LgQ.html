functions work the purpose of a hash
function is to transform some value into
one that can be stored and retrieved
easily you give it some value it
converts the value based on some formula
and spits out a coded version of the
value that's often the index in an array
let's go through an example to clarify
this process let's say you're running
some big event maybe it's for people who
like a certain type of music everybody
who wants to come to the event needs to
buy tickets in advance all of those
tickets are randomly numbered and those
numbers are embedded in barcodes on
physical tickets that people hand you
when they first arrive you need to be
able to look up ticket numbers fast when
people check in at the event storing the
ticket number in one of those incredible
hash functions sounds pretty great to
you you have all of your numbers now you
just need to come up with a hash
function to convert them to hash values
so they can be stored easily one common
pattern in hash functions is to take the
last few digits of a big number divided
by some consistent number and using the
remainder from that division to find a
place to store that number in a array in
this case the remainder turned directly
into the index of an array why does this
strategy work well if the numbers we had
assigned to each ticket where is zero to
a hundred
we could easily store it all in an array
and look them up instantly by the index
when numbers are big and random like the
ones we started with we need some way to
convert those numbers into array indices
quickly that's how the constant time
lookup works you give your number to a
hash function which spits out a hash
code that turns into the index of an
array you can go to your array and get
your original value in constant time
since an array lookup with an index
happens in constant time hmm why use the
last few digits of a big number in most
cases the last few digits are the most
random if you were assigning your
numbers in numerical order the first few
digits really wouldn't be random they're
more likely to
start with a1 a2 a3 etc then later
numbers like 7 8 or 9</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
