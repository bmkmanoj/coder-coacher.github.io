network with the costs on the edges as
shown initially each node has a single
distance vector representing the
shortest path cost to each other
incident node in the graph for example
the distance between X and X is
obviously zero and the shortest known
distance between x and y from x's
perspective is 1 the direct path
similarly the shortest known distance
between X and Z 2 X at the outset is 5
because all it knows is the direct path
note that a shorter path between X and Z
exists via Y but X simply doesn't know
about it yet now in distance vector
routing every node sends its vectors to
every other adjacent node and each node
then updates its routing table according
to the bellman-ford equation let's look
at what happens when node X learns of
y's distance vectors well in this case
the distance from X to Z will be
computed as the minimum of the sums of
all distances to Z through any
intermediate node so the cost between x
and y is 1 and the distance between y
and z as discovered by y's distance
vector is 2 therefore X can update its
shortest cost distance to Z as 3
similarly X will receive a distance
vector from z520
but of course when it uses the
bellman-ford equation to update its
distances again the distance between Z
and X will be updated from 5 to 3 we can
repeat this exercise at other nodes as
they receive distance vectors from other
nodes in the topology and quickly every
node in the network has a complete
routing table
now when costs decrease the network
converges quickly but one problem is
that when failures occur bad news can
actually travel slowly</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
