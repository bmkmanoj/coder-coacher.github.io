problem is pretty hard its exponential
in the number of features in this case N
and there's sort of two general
approaches that people have used to try
to attack this problem broadly speaking
the first is called filtering and the
second is called wrapping with the W not
an R well has an R too but it starts
with the W and they actually look pretty
similar so I drew these little cartoons
which I hope would make it easier for
you to see so filtering basically works
like this you have a set of features as
input you run them through some
algorithm that maximizes some kind of
criterion and then it outputs fewer
features and passes those to some
learning algorithm that will then use it
for classification say it could be
regression more generally but you know
without loss of generality let's assume
that we're worried about classification
problems here so you'll notice then that
the criterion of how you know whether
you're doing well or not is buried
inside the search algorithm itself by
contrast you could do what's called
wrapping and in the the wrapping
approach you take in your set of
features your in features and you run
them into this little box that basically
searches over a subset of features ask
the learning algorithm to do something
with them the learning algorithm
basically reports how well it does and
it uses that to update this new subset
of features that it might look for and
passes to the algorithm so this is
called filtering because this is a
process that filters the features before
handing it to a learning algorithm and
this is called wrapping because the
search for the features is wrapped
around whatever your learning algorithm
is you see that I think so ok so you
might ask yourself ok great so you've
got two different approaches to this
which one might you pick and
unsurprisingly there are trade-offs so
let's talk a little bit about what those
trade-offs are actually before we do
that Michael do you have any suggestions
for what would be good or bad about
filtering versus wrapping so filtering
it feels like is how we were talking
about it before this it's this idea of
whittling down to a set of fewer
features and then handing it over kind
of one thing after the other I can
advantage of that seemed like it's sort
of very flow forward right so it the
features come in the search does its
thing it hands it over every
he's got its job the disadvantage of
that though is that there isn't any
feedback so the learning algorithm can't
inform the search algorithm as to hey
you know you gave me this feature but
without that or took away that feature
but without it I'm having a lot of
trouble doing the learning maybe you
should put that one back in the second
the rapping approach I guess would allow
for that in fact that's exactly right so
as I said before in the filtering case
the criterion or criteria is built
inside the search art rhythm itself
without reference to the learner by
contrast in rapping the criteria or
criteria and if it's a single one is
actually built inside what the learner
wants it's built inside class something
like classification error or sum of
squared errors or whatever it is that
you measure your learner by so we can
write those down and stare at them for a
little while</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
