unsurprisingly I said that the two most
similar situations in my original answer
were both deeply and superficially
similar a woman climbing a stepladder is
both deeply similar into the
relationship of the same and
superficially similar and that the woman
and the latter are somewhat similar I
also said the woman climbing set of
stairs was both deep and superficially
similar we still have a woman climbing
in both and I said that a set of stairs
is somewhat superficially similar to a
ladder in that both are designed to
allow someone to ascend although some
others might say that that's not
superficially similar then I said that
the other three that involved rising in
some way were all deeply similar as well
the plane taking off into the sky the
woman climbing the corporate ladder and
the ant walking up the wall were all
deeply similar to me because all
involved this relationship of climbing I
said that the woman painting a ladder
was only superficially similar which is
why it was one of the lowest rated in
our original exercise and finally the
water bottle sitting on a desk is not a
deeply similar North superficially
similar because nothing is the same
between those two situations this is
good David once again different people
may give different answers to this
exercise why they may do so well let's
examine it next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
