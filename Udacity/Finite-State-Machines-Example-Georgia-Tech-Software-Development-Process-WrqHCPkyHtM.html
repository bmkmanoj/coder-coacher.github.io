from an informal specification and the
specification is the one shown here in
file spec dot txt this is the
specification for the maintenance
function in a specific system so what
we're doing is that we're taking the
description of the functionality of the
system and we're building a model in
this case a final state machine for it
and there is no need to look at all the
details for the specification but I want
to point out that if we look at the way
the specification is written we can
identify specific cases that we need to
take into account like here if something
happens something else will follow again
if something happens something else will
follow so we have multiple choices here
here we determine the next steps and so
on so all we have to do is to go through
this process identify these cases and
then build a machine that represents
these cases for the spec that we just
consider this is the state machine that
will result again there is no need to go
through all the details but what I want
to point out is that we have a set of
state for instance we have state 0 which
is no maintenance and if a request comes
in the system will move in the system
wait for pickup then if the pickup
actual occurs the system will move to
the repair state and so on and so forth
so this is just a more systematic
representation of what was in the
informal specification and I will argue
that this is much easier to understand
at least for somebody who has to develop
test for this system in fact what we're
going to see next that is how we can go
from that representation to a set of
test cases and the way in which we do it
is by covering the behaviors represented
by the finite state machine and we can
decide how we want to cover them for
example we might want to cover all the
states so we might want to identify
paths in this state machine they go
through all the states in the machine
like the one I just draw or this one
this one and this one so if we consider
this four test cases
we can see that all the states in my
system or at least all the states that I
have identified are colored I might want
to go a little further and decide that I
not only want to cover all of the states
but I want to cover all of the
transitions because it makes sense to
visit the state when coming from
different states and if I want to do
that and I look at the test cases that I
generated so far I can see that there is
one transition the one here that is not
covered and the same can be said for the
two transitions here so what I can
decide to do is to generate another test
case that covers those or extend an
existing one for
I could extend this test case by adding
a visit to the state before going back
to this - alternatively I could also
generate new test cases such as this one
to cover the missing transitions and
once I have these test cases I can
express them in a clearer way by simply
specifying what are the states that they
cover I'm just going to give you a
couple of examples so if we look at the
last one that I added which will be test
case number five I just need to specify
that they will go through state zero
which is this one five which is this one
six and then back to zero and I can do
the same for the other test cases so
this will be my complete set of test
cases so the bottom line here is that it
is much harder to build a set of test
cases that will cover the behavior of an
informal description but by going
through a model so by building in this
case a finite state machine for that
description we can in a much easier way
see what the behaviors of interest of
the system are and try to cover them and
there is again in the spirit of breaking
down a complex problem into smaller
steps that we can better manage which in
the end results in a more efficient and
effective testing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
