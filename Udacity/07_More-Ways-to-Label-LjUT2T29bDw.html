radio group pattern notes it is
recommended that both the radio group
and the radio button have a label that
is visible and referenced using the aria
labeled by property and use an aria
described by property to add additional
information to the radio buttons already
a group REO provides several mechanisms
for adding labels and descriptions to
elements in fact aria is the only way to
add accessible help or description text
let's take a look at the properties area
provides to enable us to create
accessible labels aria-label allows us
to specify a string directly to be used
as the accessible label one situation in
which you might use an aria-label
attribute is where you have some kind of
visual indication as to the purpose of
an element but still need to clarify
that for anyone who might not be able to
access that visual indication such as a
button which uses a graphic to indicate
its purpose this overrides any other
native labeling mechanisms such as a
label element or for example if a button
has both text content and an aria-label
only the Aria label value will be used
Aria labeled by allows us to specify an
element ID to refer to another element
in the dumb as this element label are a
label x is much like using a label
element with some key differences are
you labeled by may be used on any
element aria labeled by is much like
using a label element with some key
differences are a label by may be used
on any element not just label elements
while a label element our first of the
thing at labels the relationship is
reversed in the case of Aria labeled by
the thing which is labeled refers to the
thing which labels it since aria only
affects the accessibility tree are a
label by does not give you the nice
label cleaning behavior you get from a
label element Ariely will buy can take a
list of ID refs to compose a label out
of multiple elements the label will be
concatenated in the order the ID refs
are given and I really would buy can
refer to elements which are otherwise
hidden from assistive technology I
really would buy overrides all other
name sources for an element so for
example if something has both an aria
labeled by and an RA label
or an re labeled by and a native HTML
label the Aria label by label will
always take precedence</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
