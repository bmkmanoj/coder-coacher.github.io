handedness so let's review the answers
on the quiz the one here that's correct
I really like this because the touch
targets are nice and big and they're in
a place that's really easy to touch if
you're using a phone with one hand but
this one here on the right the touch
targets are really tiny so they're gonna
be really hard to press yeah on phones
you should try and have a 48 dip minimum
touch target and lots of padding
yeah when users are on the go it's even
harder for them to touch the precise
little areas like that yeah and these
other two are not so good because if you
look at the placement of these buttons
they're actually in an area of the
screen which is not very easy to touch
just if you don't believe me just pull
out your phone and try and touch those
areas it's not easy so that brings us to
something called the Al zone so here's
some interesting statistics 50% off
smartphone usage occurs with a single
hand so this diagram is really important
to keep in mind when you're building
applications for people to use these red
areas are the ones that you should avoid
there call the a zones what you really
want to reach for is disagreeing area
which is the tip so if you put actions
and buttons or any kind of interaction
in that area it'll make your application
much easier to use it - single hand so
take out your smartphone and see if you
can identify where the natural zones are
and where the Al zones are for you this
varies depending on what phone you have
and how big your hand is yeah exactly
and one hand use is not the only way to
hold your phone there's also two handed
use that's kind of like when I'm sending
an iamb or text to somebody right yeah
exactly and there's also what's called
cradling which is hold with one hand and
point with the other yeah I commonly do
that when I'm browsing the web yeah so
handedness and other role constraints
are all part of thinking about the user
and making your application fit in their
lives in a way that they're comfortable
performing tasks and using your
applications to achieve those tasks so
when you're building an application keep
the user in mind and make sure to make
the appropriate decisions whether
tendinous or respecting other
constraints to deliver a compelling
experience</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
