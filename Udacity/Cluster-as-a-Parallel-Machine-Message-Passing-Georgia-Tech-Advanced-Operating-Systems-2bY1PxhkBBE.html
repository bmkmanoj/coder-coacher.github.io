parallel program on other words the
application programmer is going to think
about his application and write the
program as an explicitly parallel
program and there are two styles of
writing explicitly parallel programs and
correspondingly system support for those
two styles of explicitly parallel
programs one is called message passing
style of explicitly parallel program the
runtime system is going to provide a
message passing library which has
primitives for an application thread to
do sends and receives to its peers that
are executing on other nodes of the
cluster so this message passing style of
explicitly parallel program is true to
the physical nature of the cluster the
physical nature of the cluster is the
fact that every processor has its
private memory and this memory is not
shared across all the processes so the
only way a processor can communicate
with another processor is by sending a
message through the network that this
processor can receive this processor
cannot directly reach into the memory of
this processor because that is not the
way the cluster is architected so the
message passing library is true to the
physical nature of the cluster that
there is no physically shared memory and
lots of examples of message passing
libraries that have been written to
support explicit parallel programming in
a cluster they include MPI message
passing interface MPI for short PBM CLF
from Digital Equipment Corporation so
these are all examples of message
passing libraries that have been built
with the intent of allowing application
programmer to write explicitly parallel
programs using this message passing
style and to this day many scientific
applications running on large-scale
clusters in National Labs like Lawrence
Livermore and Argonne National Labs and
so on use this style of programming
using MPI as the message passing fabric
now the only downside to the message
passing style of
programming is that it is difficult to
program using the style if you are a
programmer who written sequential
programs the transition path to writing
an explicitly parallel program is easier
if there is this notion of shared memory
because it is natural to think of shared
data structures among different threads
of an application and that's the reason
making the transition from sequential
program to parallel programming using
for instance the pthread library or an
SMP is fairly intuitive and easy pathway
on the other hand if the programmer has
to think in terms of coordinating their
activities on different processes by
explicitly sending and receiving
messages from the peers that is calling
for a fairly radical change of thinking
in terms of how to structure a program</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
