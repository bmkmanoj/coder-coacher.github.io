at the destination for Z it's the same
as the origin for y so again it's one e
and nine in so shocked this seems like a
pretty straightforward way of storing
cases but as we get a lot of different
cases this is going to get very large
very quickly and if we have a lot of
different variables then it's going to
be a lot of trouble to search there's a
good point David remember that we are
trying to store things because we want
able to retrieve things later and if I
were storage mechanism is such that it
does not allow for efficient retrieval
then it's not a very good storage
mechanism and as you correctly point or
David there's a number of entries in
please in this table and the number of
dimensions in which we are looking at
the entries also increases this is going
to become an inefficient process for
retrieval therefore let us look at a
second method called discrimination
trees which provides an alternative way
of storing these cases in a memory</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
