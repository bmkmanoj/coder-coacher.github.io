give you is something that comes from
the world of what's called drama
management and the way I'm going to
introduce this to you is I'm going to
point out what we've actually been
talking about so far so I'm cheating a
little bit for you and helping you with
what have we learned part of the lesson
so I'm going to claim that if you think
about at least the last few things about
communication and coaching particularly
on the coaching thing with human beings
we've kind of talked about three
different ways that a human can
communicate to an agent the first is
demonstrations right you show the
example of one particular drawing
through a grid world through inverse
reinforcement learning and that was a
demonstration and i can give you
multiple demonstrations we talked a
little bit about rewards and that what a
human can give you is rewards for
various things that you do and that's a
kind of reward shaping way and the last
thing we talked about was policy shaping
where what the human is communicating to
you is not demonstrations and not reward
values but actually telling you what the
correct policy thing is in response to
things that you've done and the last
policies is different from the first
demonstrations in that in the first case
you would actually demonstrate what the
right action is but here with the policy
shaping you're just giving critique that
gives information about whether a
particular policy is correct or not does
that make sense yeah that's a ching
there's these different kind of
mechanisms for giving feedback right so
I want to talk about another sort of
model and way of doing coordination this
time between a human and an agent who's
interacting with another human right so
in the cases we described before there
were two there was you know the human
there was an agent but here I'm going to
say there's a third person so I'm going
to replace the human with what I'm going
to call a player for example player of a
game like pac-man the agent which in
this case would be pac-man and a third
human I'm going to call the author so in
the world of drama manager there's this
basic idea that there are these things
like choose your own adventure stories
there's ways of seeing tasks in the
world as if they are games where there's
some author someone who designs the game
designs the system whether it be pac-man
or a story or a movie or anything that
you can imagine any sort of interaction
in the world and wants to build an agent
which is actually a
system which interferes with a third
agent so to speak which is the player
the person that's controlling what's
going on in this world so in this
pac-man example the author would be the
person that created pac-man the player
would be the person controlling pac-man
running around in this world and eating
and then the agent would be the actual
pac-man game itself and that agent might
have the ability to change the way the
ghost behave to set up another level
that has different properties or
whatever it wants and the goal of the
agent is to create an experience for the
player that is consistent with whatever
it is the author wants does that make
any sense at all a high level I mean I
don't how does the author express what
he or she want ah that's a good point so
the author wants to tell the agent
something the player is going to be
interacting with the agent and the
author never gets to play with the
player how does the author express to
the agent what it wants well that's what
I'm going to talk about but let me just
kind of give you a little preview
imagine that the author says to the
agent I want the player to be able to
win every level but only after they died
several times in that level I want the
player to feel like they have to learn
how to play better so the game has to be
hard but it can't be so hard that the
player can never win ok now I haven't
told you how to communicate that with
numbers but you can imagine that that's
an objective function it's a thing i
could write down that i keep track of
you know how quickly a player can go
through a level whether it gets better
over time I could come up with a
function that tries to capture elements
of that either directly through the
experience or by describing properties
of the game properties of the pac-man
level that need to be traded off one
another in terms of things like
difficulty good so there's lots of ways
of doing it and people have been solving
worrying about this problem for many
many years now and I want to describe a
particular mechanism that combines this
notion of demonstrations and rewards so
that you can come up with a way for this
author to convey information to the
agents so that the player has
experience that is consistent with the
author's intent okay yeah that seems to
fit with a couple of the things we've
been talking about in this lesson
excellent so let's dive in</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
