I'll open up the pirate fleet Xcode
project and then I'll launch the app and
as soon as the game launches we begin in
the guessing phase as opposed to when we
actually get a place or ships and our
minds and that's something you'll do in
code now we've kept the UI pretty simple
here at the top we have the opponent's
grid and at the bottom we have our grid
with our ships and our minds that have
already been placed now as I start
guessing I want you to think about what
objects and relationships may exist
between the scenes so I'm going to start
guessing and I have a little strategy in
mind don't try to guess every two spaces
because I feel like that'll give me a
pretty good shot at hitting a ship being
that the small ship sides to a bed of
mine hopefully I won't fall too far
behind here got one ship and it looks
like they're doing some work on my big
ships right now this here we go all
right I got the two big ships out of the
way oh there we go oh oh I think they
might all be lined up here so I have
enough time I may be able to get all of
them there we go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
