apparent once I start assigning my
centroids with these colored regions is
how all the points are going to be
associated with one of the centroids
with one of the clusters so you can see
that the blue is probably already in
reasonably good shape I would say we got
a little bit lucky and where the the
initial centroid was placed it looks
like it's pretty close to the the center
of this blob of data with the red and
the green it looks like they're sitting
kind of right on top of each other in
the same cluster so let's watch as
k-means starts to sort out this
situation and get all the clusters
properly allocated so I hit go the first
thing that it does is it tells me
explicitly which cluster each one of
these points will fall into so you see
that we have a few blue that fall into
the wrong cluster over here and then of
course the red and the green so this is
the Association step as all the points
are being associated with the nearest
centroid and the next thing that I'll do
is I'm going to update the centroid so
now this is going to move the centroids
to the the mean of all of the associated
points so in particular I expect this
green point to be pulled over to the
right by the fact that we have so many
points over here let's update now this
is starting to look much better if we
were to just leave everything as is you
can see how the clustering was before so
now all these points that used to be
green are now about to become red and
likewise with a few blue points over
here you can see how even just in one
step from this bad initial condition
we've already started to capture the
structure in the data pretty well now
I'm going to reassign the points iterate
through this again so reassign each
point to the nearest centroid and now
things are starting to look very very
consistent there's probably just one one
or two more iterations before we have
the centroids right at the middle of the
clusters so I update and reassign points
no points have changed so this is the
final clustering that would be assigned
by k-means clustering so in three or
four steps using this algorithm I
assigned every point to a cluster and it
worked in a really beautiful way for
this example</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
