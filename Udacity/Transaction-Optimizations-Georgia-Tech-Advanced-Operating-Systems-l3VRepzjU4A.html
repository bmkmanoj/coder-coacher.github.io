opportunities for the developer to give
hints to the library on optimizing the
performance of the library for the
chosen application in other words the
transaction semantics of our VM is
already a stripped-down version of the
traditional transaction semantics it
doesn't worry about nested transactions
and so on but still transaction by its
very nature requires that at commit
point you have to do a synchronous i/o
to the disk and similarly transaction by
its very nature says that it has an
all-or-nothing property so the
transaction is not going to commit that
is it is going to abort then we have to
make sure that all the changes that have
been made between begin transaction
aboard transaction or thrown away and
similarly if the transaction commits
then we have to make sure that at the
commit point all the changes that have
been made to in-memory copies or
persistent data structures are committed
to the disk that's where synchronous i/o
comes in but if the developer wants to
optimize this performance rvm gives
opportunities for such optimizations the
first opportunity is the no restore mode
in the begin transaction call the no
restore mode in begin transaction is
signaling to our VM that this
transaction that I'm starting is not
going to avoid and therefore there is no
need for you to create an in-memory undo
record for me even though I'm going to
give you a set range call don't bother
creating an undo record for the range of
addresses that i intend to modify in
this begin transaction that's what is
meant by the no restore mode so that
reduces the amount of work that RBM has
to do in doing a memory copy and the
application is going to gain because our
VM is doing less work which means the
overhead and performing a transaction is
going to be less as seen by the
application the second optimization
opportunities are no flush mode in the
end transaction as I mentioned a
transaction truly has committed only
when the changes to the critical section
between begin transaction and end
transaction have been synchronously
written out to the disk so the normal
semantics of an end transaction that is
a commit of a transaction would require
that our VM should block the process
that made that call for n transaction
until that redo record has been written
synchronously to the desk but if the
application developer is opportunistic
and believes that the chances of failure
either due to power failure or due to
his own software clashing is pretty
small he could be brave enough to say no
flush mode and what that no flash mode
is telling the RVM library is that there
is no need to do a synchronous i/o of
course I want you to write it to the
desk but don't block me in order to
write to the desk so no need to do the
synchronous flush of the redo log to the
desk and in other words what we are
getting by doing a no flush more than n
transaction is lazy persistence we know
it is going to be persisted on the disk
that is the work that our VM is going to
do but it is not doing it exactly at the
point of entrance action so the upshot
is there is a window of vulnerability n
transaction happened here and maybe by
the time our VM gets to write it out to
the disk so much time has elapsed so
this time window is the window of
vulnerability so if this axis is time
then n transaction happened here and
this is the point where the redo record
was committed to the disk so this is the
portion which we are calling as a window
of vulnerability and the app developer
is taking a chance saying that I am so
sure that no clash is going to happen in
this window I'm going to go ahead and
say no flush so in other words the
transaction is being used as an
insurance and this should remind you of
the old adage that we saw when we talked
about shared memory systems shared
memory system scale really well when you
don't share memory similarly
transactional system scale really well
perform really well when you don't use
the full semantic requirement of
transaction in particular if you can get
rid of synchronous i/o it'll make the
performance better</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
