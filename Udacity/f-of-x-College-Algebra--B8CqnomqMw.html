might write a function like this first
we named the function in this case we
named our function decrease by 3 then we
create a spot for the input which we
call X and put it in parentheses and
then we define what the output is going
to be with this return statement and
then we write the output right here X
minus 3 but as you've probably come to
realize over the course of this class
some people who do math a lot a little
bit lazier like me for one thing in math
the name of the function is not usually
nearly as inventive as it is in computer
science we can see that a programmer
would call functions something like this
decreased by 3 that really describes
what the function is doing in math
though our names for functions are
really simple in fact the most common
one is probably just the letter F what
programmers and mathematicians do in
common however is that they still use
the parentheses around what's going to
be the input for the function and of
course X does seem like a pretty great
input now the programmer has a return
statement that represents what the
output of this function is going to be
only run the program but a math we just
create an equation so if we want to
create the decrease by 3 equation in
math instead we just write f of x equals
x minus 3 the output is just that
expression that we've often seen written
to describe the dependent variable
showing how it depends on the
independent variable now the way that we
read the left hand side of this equation
right here is we say f of X now again
just like in programming the parentheses
here around the input do not mean
multiplication so the output of the
function the thing that's just equal to
X minus 3 is this f of X over here
remember we used to say that the output
was why if the input was X so we're
really doing in functions is replacing
the independent variable Y with this new
way of writing it f of X I think you'll
see over time why this is a useful way
of writing it but it doesn't make the
original way we learned any less valid
they're just different ways of
expressing pretty similar things
assuming that this is a function now
that you've seen how both computer
science and math
maddox would represent the same function
in different ways I'd like you to
translate the first function that we
talked about from Python into its
mathematical form so this is the
function that we initially called
increased by 2 I like the input to be X
and the output to be X plus 2 i'd also
like you to name the function f so just
like we did up here right the
mathematical form of the function down
