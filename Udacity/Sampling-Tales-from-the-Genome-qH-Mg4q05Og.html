his or her parents they might choose to
look by signing up for genome service
that will get their genomes information
and compared to everyone else's genome
in the system to see if there is a match
for example you'd imagine we might just
take some of the sequence from the
adopted person and compare it letter for
letter to a sequence from a random
person we could even do the comparisons
with a lot of random people but there
are three billion base pairs in every
genome six billion once you count both
copies of all your chromosomes from each
parent so doing a letter by letter
comparison of the whole thing would take
such a long time and a lot of
computational power instead the general
technique used for comparisons is
similar to that used to match DNA at
crime scenes or even a paternity test it
involves a general statistical process
known as sampling a sampling is
concerned with the selection of a subset
of individuals from within a population
des de may characteristics about the
whole population in this case instead of
looking at all three billion letters in
the human genome will select a random
subset of letters let's say a million
from one genome and compare the same
subset from one genome to another so if
we do this random sampling what do you
think are two advantages of random
sampling compared to total genome
sequencing make sure you check two of
the answers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
