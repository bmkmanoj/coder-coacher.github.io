more closely once again we have a come
across this idea earlier we did an
illogical retrieval and recording cases
by the k-nearest neighbor method within
a large equal to t1 case based reasoning
using two different methods the array
method the discrimination tree method
haydee criteria for evaluating
similarity were very clear as we
discussed earlier euclidean distance
same tags as well as placement in this
discrimination tree the question now
becomes what criteria should be used to
decide on the similarity between the
target problem and the source case given
that it comes from different domains on
surface this seems to be a little
similar between the two now the objects
is similar in all the values of features
is similar yet there is a deep
similarity there we can distinguish now
between superficial similarity between
two situations and deep similarity
between two situations superficial
similarity deals with features of
objects or counts of objects or objects
themselves deep similarity deals with
relationship between objects or
sometimes relationships between
relationships examples of this arise
from the Ravens test with which you
already familiar features here refer to
the size of this square the size of the
circle or perhaps where there is a
hollow square or a solid dot the count
refers to the number of squares or
number of circles in a particular image
obvious here refer to circles and
squares and dots let us look at
relationship between objects to
situation since it will be deeply
similar if the relationship between the
objects is similar as an example a and B
are similar in that that the dot is
outside the circle here and the square
is outside the circle here a and B are
also similar in that the dot is above
the circle here and the square as above
the circle here what about relationships
between relationships let us compare a
and B in going from A to B the dot has
disappeared and the square has come
outside the circle and become bigger now
we can compare this relationship between
a and B with some of the relationship
between a C and addie in which to some
object might be disappearing
and another object which was in the
center of the circle comes out of the
circle I am sure you have come across
problems like that on the Ravens test
this is an example of a binary
relationship a relationship between two
objects this is an example of a higher
order relationship a tertiary
relationship if you wish this is a
relationship between relationship
between objects you might even say that
these are examples of unitary
relationships these original examples of
objects and the features and counts in
general as we go from unary
relationships to binary relationships
the tertiary relationship to even higher
order relationships this similarity
becomes deeper and deeper this means
that mind decides to situations to be
more similar if the similarity is at the
level of relationship between objects
rather than simply the level of objects
of features accounts or objects</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
