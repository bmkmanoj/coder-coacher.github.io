noticed that there are different types
of exceptions but you didn't know what
they're for now we haven't formally
talked about them so let's do that now
the first time you saw an exception was
in the first course in the nanodegree
when we were building the just java
coffee ordering app now the a brand to
exception and crashed to debug the
program we opened up the Android logs to
reveal the stack trace and then
discovered an illegal state exception
was thrown when the submit order method
could not be found in the main activity
alright let's look at some documentation
about exceptions when a java method
fails or runs into an unexpected state
it can throw an exception short form an
exceptional event exceptions are
basically errors but they're also
captured or wrapped in actual instances
of the exception class which holds
information about what went wrong and
what was happening the system at the
time if you look here on the left for
example you'll also notice that there
are more specific types of exceptions
that actually extend from the exception
superclass a great example of
inheritance in use in the Java framework
in other words all of these specific
classes are subclasses of the base class
exception for example here we have an
illegal state exception or a null
pointer exception we also saw the
security exception earlier in this
lesson when the Internet permission was
missing from our tzunami app now you
could create a new exception class for
your own purposes for example we could
create an invalid earthquake exception
and define it as we normally would
create a custom class and then have that
custom class just extend from the base
exception class from there we could
customize the exception to hold say very
specific information about an invalid
earthquake scenario so as a developer
you can write a method that declares
that it will throw an exception meaning
that the code inside that method either
one generates an exception to indicate a
unique condition or two and more
commonly calls a method that throws an
exception meaning that the Android
runtime tried to execute some code but
ran into a problem and therefore gave
notice of the problem by throwing the
it's also important to note that if an
exception is thrown it also means that
the code following the line that caused
the exception won't get executed so how
do you do this in Java code there are
two distinctions that I'd like you to
pay attention to number one anywhere in
your Java code where you want to cause
or invoke an exception you use the
keyword throw like in this example here
where we want to throw an invalid
purchase exception because we detected
that something went wrong within our
complete purchase method number two and
this is much more subtle any time our
code throws an exception that isn't a
descendant of the error or runtime
exception classes we must explicitly
declare in our method signature that our
method could throw such an exception in
java programming speak this is known as
a checked exception and has the
implication that any code that calls or
users our method must handle the
exception ie call our method in a try
block this is enforced by the Java
compiler in other words whoever calls
the complete purchase method has to have
a back-up plan if the invalid purchase
exception is thrown or occurs we'll talk
about how to handle exceptions in the
next video in case you'd like to learn
more about unchecked first checked
exceptions in more detail see this
tutorial linked in the notes below this
video one more important note just
because there's a standard framework for
how to use exceptions in Java it doesn't
mean that you should throw exceptions
every time something goes wrong this is
where developer discretion comes into
play ideally if we discover a problem or
unique situation we should try and
handle it gracefully in code by just
falling back to some reasonable default
behavior for example and continuing
executing if possible we call this
failing silently however should we deem
that it be more detrimental to keep
going with an error state then we may
decide it's best to notify our calling
code of the error by throwing exception
we've seen this in play already in the
case of our tzunami app when we tried to
request earthquake data from the
internet the android framework code
through a security exception this is a
case when it's better to throw an
exception and
trash the app as opposed to continuing
without the internet permission now if
the android framework code had failed
silently then we as developers would
probably be super confused as to why we
didn't receive response from the server
in the case of the tsunami and quick
report apps we won't actually be
creating our own custom exceptions or
throwing exceptions intentionally we
will however be calling the android
framework code that does throw
exceptions and we'll need to handle
those exceptions appropriately let's
talk about that next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
