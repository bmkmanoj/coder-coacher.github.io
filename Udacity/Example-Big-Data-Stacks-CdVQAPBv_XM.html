technologies that are used in cloud
computing and also we mentioned a number
of types of functionality that cloud
computing technology needs to provide
for then let me offer our bird's eye
view off two popular stacks for for big
data that are used in cloud computing
platforms the to concrete stacks I want
to show you is the Hadoop big data stack
it's an open source stack and then also
the berkeley data analytics tagged be
des this is another open source stack
these are by the way not the only
options there are a number of both
proprietary stacks and also a number of
other open source stacks for instance
one example is the so called HPCC stack
by LexisNexis this is actually even
predates Hadoop however it wasn't
necessarily popular or widely used
outside of the LexisNexis environment
when it comes to the overall popularity
and adoption rate both in commercial and
academic settings or research settings
these two are probably the dominant
stacks out there today the Hadoop
architecture looks like this at the
bottom layer there is the data storage
layer the Hadoop file system and this
takes care of taking large amounts of
data and somehow splitting them and
replicating and making sure that the
doesn't get lost and making sure that
there are no hotspots in the system etc
then there is a processing framework
that can allow computation to operate on
such data and that deals with the
scheduling of what are the specific
notes that particular data manipulation
operations need to be scheduled ideally
the scheduling should be done in such a
way so that you don't have to constantly
move data from one node to another
depending on what is the task that needs
to process it we're really not going to
talk in more detail about the MapReduce
framework the intent of these is just as
an illustration to provide you with an
overview of the breadth of technologies
in the space there's a component HBase
and this provides a table like view of
the stored data
that is more similar to what we're
familiar with in the context of of
databases but it is not the same as the
relational database representation of
the data as were used in the SQL
environment in order to support data
processing and data query operations
like what SQL databases support there's
a language front-end hi if that will
take an SQL query and then translate it
into a number of these MapReduce
operations that will then operate on top
of the data that's stored in these HBase
tables on top of the distributed file
system or there are a number of
higher-level services that would also
provide the same kinds of things so end
users can use the our environment in
order to describe certain rules about
how data should be processed and
analyzed or can use the machine learning
algorithms one of a collection of many
that are supported supported in the
house component that's part of a Hadoop
stack and a number of other technologies
that provide more specialized types of
functionality or different kinds of
interfaces to the end users and the
lowest level however all of these end up
being a number of these more primitive
operations that can execute on top of
the distributed file system where the
data is stored and their number of
supporting services that are needed in
order to deal with locking or
coordination or to provide the streaming
of data into this distributed
environment and this is what the
berkeley bid a stack looks like there is
similarly a component that's the data
storage layer and then there is an
in-memory component that is the
in-memory file system so so that you can
avoid the caches you can run the regular
hadoop mapreduce engines on top of this
layer or you can run another type of
programming model another processing
framework called spark there are a
number of front ends for for the spark
in terms of the kinds of execution
models that are supported so whether
it's an SQL like
queries or stream processing or graph
processing or machine learning types of
operations that should be executed on
top of this processing framework another
component that's important to to mention
is this Mises component that's the
lowest level scheduling framework the
lowest level resource manager that
allows the resources to be partitioned
and then used by different types of
frameworks you may have a partition
that's a Hadoop partition a partition
that's a spark partition a partition
that's an MPI partition and using this
tag the two will be able to basically
coordinate and negotiate among them and
then you'll have elasticity across these
very different types of frameworks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
