number six on slam and we are going to
practice some more questions about the
graph slam algorithm and I will ask you
something new about how to make graph
slam more efficient towards the end of
this homework assignment first write
three questions and one new thing which
comes with additional questions in a
programming assignment so let's dive in
in this example picture a robot that
starts at initial position five this
robot which lives in 1d even though I'm
drawing this in 2d sees a landmark with
the relative measurement of two it then
moves to coordinate x1 by taking a step
of seven it now sees a different
landmark l1 with a measurement value of
four
finally it moves again with a motion -
and now it sees the same second landmark
not the original on a value of two
obviously when I walk it out and solve
this you find that the best corners over
here at 12 and 14 with Lema coordinates
are 7 and 16 but none of the numbers I
just thought you will be inserted in the
question I'm about to ask picture the
matrix Omega and the vector C I want you
to add all these constraints into Omega
with the caveat that for the initial
constraint I assume the strength is just
1 so enter it the way you used to
I also assume the motion update has a
sigma of 1 but the measurement update
the Sigma for measurements has a value
of 0.5 and remember we weigh those
updates with 1 over Sigma which in the
measurement case would therefore be 2 I
want you to fill in the values for Sigma
and foxy for this specific example I
gave you some of the Sigma values and
some of the Z values and I want you to
fill in the missing values over here you
can check whether you got them correct
by verifying that I got those numbers
correct and you can also
solve for Omega minus one times C and
out should come the red positions shown
in the diagram over here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
