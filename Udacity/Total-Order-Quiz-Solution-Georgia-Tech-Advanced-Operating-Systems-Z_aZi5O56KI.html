orders that we see in the distributed
system you can see that a happens before
B B happens before C C happens before E
and these are purely coming from the
chain of communication and local events
that are happening over here when we
come over here we also observe that F
happens before E that's because of
sequentiality of this process and
similarly we can see that in process p1
a happens before D so these are the
partial orders and we already have an
ordering for the events that follow this
chain because the logical time Stamper
is signed in this fashion and in order
to derive a total order we said we
basically will believe the events time
stamps to order them totally so we can
order these events totally a 1 B 2 C 3 e
5 we can order them totally now let's
look at the concurrent events that are
happening the concurrent events that are
happening is D over here is concurrent
with all the other events in their other
processes these concurrent with B and C
is concurrent with F any and similarly
if you look at this event F its
concurrent with all the events that are
happening in process p2 and p1 right so
this is what you see is a concurrent
events so now what we have to do is
given that the U concurrent events we
have to somehow fit them into a total
order as I said before no problem in
fitting these guys in the total order
because they already have time stamps
that distinguish them from one another
the time stamp associated is a is 1 B is
2 C is 3 E is 5 no problem with that the
real problem comes with F and D now the
sequentiality of this process is what
made the time stamp associated a to be 5
because the message that came over here
had a time stamp of 3 but we associated
a time stamp of 5 with e because the
local event preceding e has a time stamp
of 4 so we picked 5 as a time stamp to
associate with e so that the sequential
of this process p3 is respected so we've
got this and now we've got F and D and
so F obviously is gonna sneak in before
he that's that's no problem that is
coming from the sequentiality but where
will we put D do should we put the after
E or should we put D before E in the
total order this is where the breaking
the tie using process ID comes into play
because these two guys are concurrent
events in the system we're breaking the
tie using the process ID P one happens
to be less than P three and process ID
space and therefore we're going to say
that in the total order D is going to be
ahead totally ordered before e so the
final ordering that we end up with the
total order that we end up with is a B C
F and then D and then e so that's a
total order that we come up with
respecting the logical time stamp
associated with the events and breaking
the tie using the process ID</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
