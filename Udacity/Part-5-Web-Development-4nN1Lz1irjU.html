web frameworks what exactly a web
framework is what makes something a web
framework and what are some of the other
popular web frameworks for Python and
popular web frameworks in general okay
sure so a web framework is basically the
the piece of your program that is
speaking HTTP parsing URLs until you
know a path into a query and passing
that into some handler functions that
you define and so a web framework can
can do more or less things you know
that's type type of web framework we're
using in Google App Engine actually its
lineage kind of dates back to a web
framework we've built at reddit and it's
about the level of detail that I like to
work out which is I don't think we
should be implementing HTTP but it's
nice to be aware of what the headers are
of what the query parameters are having
direct control over the URLs some
frameworks you know a very popular one
on python is called Jango you know it
does a little bit more it'll add on
sessions and user handling and form
control and all sorts of stuff like that
it's not very good for this class
because I'm trying to teach you how that
stuff works now with an understanding of
how those things work that I think you
can get out of this class knowing you'll
you'll have a better understanding of
the trade-offs those frameworks make and
what they're hiding from you and what
they're exposing to you some of which is
convenient some of which is can be
tedious when you're trying to do
something custom outside of Python
really popular frameworks Ruby on Rails
is probably one of the most popular ones
we've gotten rails and Django are
actually fairly similar in that they do
a lot of stuff for you they hide a lot
of the HTTP and a lot of the you know
URL handling and parsing and all of that
stuff I don't like to work out quite
that high a level because I feel like
when you're writing web applications
HTTP is so simple you should be close to
it because then you can do some neat
stuff when you're setting your own
headers and fiddling with your own
cookies and hashing your own things so
there's lots of frameworks out there i
think google app engine is really kind
of a nice layer for teaching and it's
actually the layer that i work in or
that we use that reddit and hit mock in
terms of the design of that framework</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
