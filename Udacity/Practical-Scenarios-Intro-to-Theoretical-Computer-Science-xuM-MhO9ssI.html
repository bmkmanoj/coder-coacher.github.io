these problems a little bit more I would
like to do the same thing that we have
done here for these five problems I will
now give you a number of practical
scenarios what I would like you to tell
me is which of these problems would
probably be most useful for attempting
an NP completeness proof so again we'll
give these problems here numbers 1 2 3 &amp;amp;
4 and I will give you 6 practical
scenarios where you can then choose
which problem to match to the scenarios
so you could have a scenario in
bioinformatics but you would like to
compare DNA sequences to each other and
what you're trying to find out is how
much information they have in common you
could have a scenario where you want to
schedule computer programs what I mean
by this is you have a bunch of computer
programs you know approximately how much
time each of those programs is going to
take and you have a number of machines
and of course you want to get as much
work done as possible
within say the next hour so you have to
decide which program to run on which
machine or you could have a question
about say classrooms where you say well
how many classrooms do we actually need
for the next semester to teach all
courses so there will be certain courses
that take place at a certain time or
that cannot be scheduled together and
your question is how many different
rooms would we actually need or you
could have the scenario where two
programmers have been working on the
same programming code and one of the
programmers has made some changes and
the other one has made some changes and
now you need to get these two codes back
together again and you do that by
figuring out what they actually still
have in common
another problem could be that you have a
number of vans or delivery trucks that
you would like to fill and you want to
find out how many vans you need to
transport all of these packages here so
they have different sizes they have
different priorities and so on and
finally a scenario that is none of the
above so something else
so please match the practical scenarios
to the np-complete problem that is most
likely to occur in that scenario and I
want you to do this by entering numbers
here that correspond to these four
problems so you'll have to use some of
these problems here more than once</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
