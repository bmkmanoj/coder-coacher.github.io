frame that would give us the data to
construct this plot here's how I would
go about constructing the code first
I'll load the deep liar package and then
I'm just going to leave myself a comment
that I'm going to chain these functions
together so i'll be using this symbol
i'm going to save my data frame as PFF c
by age gender and i'm going to work from
my existing data frame and group it so
here's my first chain command and i'm
going to group by age and gender now i'm
going to summarize getting the mean
friend count the median friend count and
in the number of people in each group
now summarize will remove one layer of
grouping when it runs so it will remove
the gender layer so we need to in Group
one more time to remove the age layer
and finally are arranged my data frame
by H now it looks like that I have
everything but I actually forgot to
filter or subset the data I could use
the subset command but I'm actually
going to show you the filter command
I'll filter the data so that way i
remove any people that have a gender
marked as an a and then i just need to
remember to chain that together with the
rest of the functions alright let's run
this code and see if our data frame
looks good it looks like i actually
forgot to run my library first let me do
that we have our new data frame up here
so let's print out some of the rows to
make sure we're right I'll head out a
couple of the first rose to the console
and i can see that i have my group split
by age and gender the mean friend count
the median friend count and in the
number of groups</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
