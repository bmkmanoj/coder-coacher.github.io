going to have to use something more
complicated than that just this ranking
from zero to eight and I'm going to I'm
going to propose a couple possibilities
so one possibility would be to continue
to return integers but to use bigger
ones so let's take an example of what we
want to compare let's say we have two
hands at a four of a kind one has four
nines and a five and the other one has
four threes and a two now we want this
hand to rank higher and under the old
formulation they would both be ranked as
a 7 because 7 is the rank for four of a
kind so if we want to change that to use
a different type of result we could use
integers and we could say let's say Oh
seven oh nine oh five and seven oh three
oh two so the nine and the five to
represent that this is four of a kind of
nines with the five left over and the
three and the two to say it's four of a
kind of threes with a two left over we
could use real numbers we could say 7.0
nine oh five or 7.0 302 another
possibility is we could use tuples so we
could use seven comma nine comma five
versus seven comma three comma two a
tuple is just like a list except it's
can't be modified and it has a slightly
different set of operations associated
with it but basically it just means a
grouping of three values in this case
now what I want you to tell me is out of
these three
possibilities which one of them would
work at all and which one of them seems
best in terms of being most convenient
and easy to work with within our program</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
