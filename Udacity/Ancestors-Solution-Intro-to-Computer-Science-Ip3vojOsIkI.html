the first row by itself is not
sufficient and the reason the first rule
doesn't work is that there's no base
case we can keep producing parent of
ancestor and parent of parent of parent
of ancestor but we can never stop
because there's no rule that defines
ancestor in terms of something other
than itself the second rule is a
recursive definition that works it says
our parent is our ancestor and the
parent of an ancestor is also an
ancestor and so this will give us
exactly the set of ancestors that we
showed before that it will be the parent
the parent of the parent the parent of
the parent of the parent the parents of
the parents of the parents of the
parents and so forth covering all of our
ancestors the third choice will also
produce that same set but it has an
unnecessary rule that we only need these
two rules here we've said parent parent
of parent parent of parent of ancestor
we can still combine these rules to
produce any word that is parent of
parent of parent of any number of times
ending and parent but it's less elegant
then the second answer which only needs
two rules to produce exactly the same
set of ancestors</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
