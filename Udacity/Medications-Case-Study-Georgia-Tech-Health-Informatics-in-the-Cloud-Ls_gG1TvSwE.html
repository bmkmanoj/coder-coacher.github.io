disease patient like Marla here phils
around 50 prescriptions per year because
for most chronic diseases medications
are the main treatment misuse of
medication including in particular
duplicate medications because of poor
coordination among providers is a major
problem that accounts for nearly a third
of all hospitalizations in the u.s.
surveys by the Commonwealth Fund in 2008
and 2011 show progress here we see the
United States improving but still twenty
eight percent of patient survey report
that no provider has reviewed their
medications with them in the past year
such a review could help ensure that
patients are taking only the medications
they need and are taking them properly
one reason for the absence review is
that physicians may not even know the
medications that other physicians have
prescribed will return to it later on
but this process called medication
reconciliation is a clear opportunity
for health IT once the underlying
records are digital here's a screenshot
from an actual commercial a chai tea
shift system showing the medications in
this physicians EMR on the right and
those out in other emrs on the left the
system even highlights this medication
which the patient is taking but which
isn't in this providers iam or</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
