going to go through all of these other
four cases I leave that to you to show
that in each of these other four cases
the total work done when you really
include everything gravity pushing etc
really must be nonzero because in each
of these I said it happened at constant
speed here when the object Falls
well that's clearly not constant speed
we know it accelerates now we're getting
somewhere
this case is so special out of these
five because the motion is changing in a
very specific way when we keep track of
the total work which I'll abbreviate
with a little T down here we find that
it causes the object's kinetic energy to
change which I'll label like this this
is so important that I'm even gonna
write it work causes changes in kinetic
energy now I know we don't know what
kinetic energy is quite yet stay tuned
one second but this statement is known
as the work energy theorem and it's
vital to physics now let's talk about
what this whole energy nonsense is</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
