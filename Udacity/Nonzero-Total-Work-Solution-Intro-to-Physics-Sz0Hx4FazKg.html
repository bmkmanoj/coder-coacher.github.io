going to go through all of these other
four cases I leave that to you to show
that in each of these other four cases
the total work done when you really
include everything gravity pushing etc
really must be nonzero because in each
of these I said it happened at constant
speed here when the object falls well
that's clearly not constant speed we
know it accelerates now we're getting
somewhere this case is so special out of
these five because the motion is
changing in a very specific way when we
keep track of the total work which I'll
abbreviate with a little T down here we
find that it causes the objects kinetic
energy to change which I'll label like
this this is so important that i'm going
to write it work causes changes in
kinetic energy now i know we don't know
what kinetic energy is quite yet stay
tuned one second but this statement is
known as the work energy theorem and
it's vital to physics now let's talk
about what this whole energy nonsense is</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
