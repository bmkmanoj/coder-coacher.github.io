thousand dollars and why is fifteen
thousand dollars congrats if you got
both of these right if you didn't that's
okay to follow along with me in the
solution and then pause it when you find
a mistake then continue sobbing and see
if you can get these answers remember
mistakes are okay and this is the time
that we learn from them i'm going to
rewrite this first equation by
subtracting x from both sides to get y
is equal to 25 thousand minus x i did
this so i could use substitution I think
that's the easier choice here now I
perform the substitution then I can
distribute my 800 to both terms here's
my first term 2000 and my second term
negative eight hundred times X i
subtract my constant term to move every
constant to the right and then that
leaves me with x on the left i combine
my like terms then i divide by the
coefficient of x i get x is equal to ten
thousand or ten thousand dollars which
we invested at seven percent and
remember this is a system of equation so
we have two variables x and y well we
know if x is ten thousand dollars y must
be fifteen thousand dollars since those
who have to add up to twenty five
thousand dollars and as always we can
check our answer by plugging in x and y
into both equations will get true
