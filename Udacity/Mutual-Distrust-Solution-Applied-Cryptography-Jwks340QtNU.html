you're gonna find two keys where either
the encryption of zero with T 0 is equal
to the encryption of 1 with key 1 or the
opposite then at least half the time she
has an advantage so in this case if she
sends this as the message if Bob guesses
0 she can win by revealing K 1 if Bob
guesses 1 she can win by revealing K 0
so she's guaranteed to win if she finds
a key pair like this well then she can
do the same thing she can reveal this is
the message and then based on Bob's
guests reveal either K 1 or K 0 either
these would also allow her to cheat if
she could find a key that has this
property that for whatever key she
happened to pick encrypt 0 - the same
thing that ki encrypted 1 - well that
would allow her to cheat just as well
but this is a harder thing to do than
finding two keys that have this property
we might not know enough yet to be able
to be sure that this is harder than that
but we know it's certainly no more
difficult and this could be easier and
we'll see that in fact it is easier the
second one would also be enough but this
is a much stronger property to find a
key pair that has both of those
properties how hard this is depends on
lots of things the first thing we have
to answer a little more is what
encryption means here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
