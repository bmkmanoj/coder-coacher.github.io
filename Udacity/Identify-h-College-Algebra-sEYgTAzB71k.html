CH appear in two spots in the general
equation we have a term minus 2 HX and
also a term H squared and the age
squared is going to be a little bit
harder for us to pick out using this
equation since we have one constant term
of five over here but we have two
constant terms H squared + K here and we
can't tell which of these is
contributing how much 25 however we have
one term in the general equation that
has an X to the first and also only one
term in the particular equation that has
an X to the first so that means that we
have negative 2 HX is equal to 6x just
matching those terms up to get h by
itself we just need to divide both sides
of the equation by negative 2x our x's
will cancel out and 6 divided by
negative 2 is just negative 3 so that's
our answer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
