stays zero once it becomes zero this is
nothing but an equilibrium and there's
two more one is at 0.55 million tonnes
and the other is at one point four five
million tonnes first one is obvious but
now let's look into where these two
other equilibria come from if we reach
the equilibrium the amount has to become
constant the rate of change becomes zero
which means that the gain per time has
to balance the loss per time the loss
per time is constant but the gain per
time depends on the current amount let's
leave this type of diagram to show how
the gain depends on the amount if you
look closely you see that this has to be
a parabola if the amount of fish is zero
they're multiplying by zero here and the
gain will be zero that's no surprise and
there's no fish there is no growth so we
know this point when the amount of fish
is equal to the maximum carrying
capacity this factor becomes zero and
the product is zero again so we know
this point as a parabola is symmetric
the maximum has to occur in the middle
between the zeros so this maximum sits
at an amount of 1 times 10 to the 6 tons
you can plug this value 1 million tons
into this expression and get that the
gain here is 2 point 5 times 10 to the 5
tons per here which is a little more
than the loss which is 2 times 10 to the
5 tons per year so we have one
equilibrium here and one equilibrium
there at both of these points the gain
and the loss the gain and the loss
balance each other if you want to you
can solve this quadratic equation to
find that this equilibrium sits at 0.55
times 1 million tons and this
equilibrium sits at 1 point 4 5 times 1
million tonnes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
