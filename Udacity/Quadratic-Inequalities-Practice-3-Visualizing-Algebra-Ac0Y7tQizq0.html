to negative 3 or one-half to positive
infinity nice algebra skills if you got
these two intervals to begin to solve
this quadratic inequality we want to
subtract 3 from both sides so we have 0
on the left and the quadratic expression
on the right we can flip the entire
inequality around so we'll have 2y
squared plus 5y minus 3 is greater than
0 these two statements here are exactly
the same they're just written in the
reverse order once we have this
inequality we want to find the zeros if
we find the zeros we can set up our
number line with three intervals so
we'll factor the left-hand side of the
equation to get 2y minus 1 times y plus
3 we set each factor equal to 0 and then
we solve for the values of Y over here
and in this case why could equal one
half and in this case why could equal
negative 3 we use positive one half and
negative 3 to create the intervals on
our number line for interval one will
try the number y equals negative 5 when
we substitute negative 5 in for y we'll
get the statement 22 is greater than 0
we know this is true so this is included
for our solution set for interval to
will try the number y equals 0 when we
plug in 0 for y will be left with
negative 3 greater than 0 we know this
is not true so any of these numbers
within this region are not part of our
solution and finally for the third
interval we can try the number y equals
1 when we plug in 1 for y we'll get for
greater than 0 this is a true statement
so we can include these values as part
of our solution set we use parenthesis
at negative 3 and positive one half
since we need to be greater than zero we
can't be equal to it so our final
solution is negative infinity to
negative 3 or one-half to positive
infinity</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
