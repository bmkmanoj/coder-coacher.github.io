way to fill out the chart I'm going to
walk through a bit of a parse to show
you how it goes I've got the grammar
here in the upper right and here's my
input string and I'm going to abuse
notation of it by using this red dot
again to mean where we are so
conceptually one of the first things
will do is shift we saw the integer
token and we were expecting that because
one of our par states here was e arrow
red dot int from zero but now we want to
turn this into into an e by using this
rule in reverse and that's a bit magical
for now but we'll see why we want to do
it real shortly then we'll want to shift
over the plus it fits with our grammar
and it's the input token we saw and next
we'll want to shift over this int and
now we'll want to replace this int with
an e just like we did above so this was
another instance of magic or this third
new rule that we're going to be talking
about and then finally now we've got an
e plus e and if we look up here in our
grammar II can be rewritten as e plus e
so we use magic once again and the
process will continue each of these
times when we've taken a token or a
terminal in the input and replaced it
with a non-terminal has been an instance
of reduction and if we were to view this
in the opposite order we'd see it as a
parse tree at the end of the day I'm
going to elide a lot of details we'd end
up with this and the shrinking input as
I replace these terminals or tokens with
non terminals sort of corresponds to how
my tree edges in here same sort of
pattern I have more and more white space
on the left more and more white space on
the left so the relationship between
this magic step and parsing should be
pretty clear but I still need to tell
you how to do it how do we actually
perform reductions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
