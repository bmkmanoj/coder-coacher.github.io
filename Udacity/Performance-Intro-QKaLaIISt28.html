tests are all passing mm-hmm and the
arrow cases done the new onboarding flow
beautiful and those material will design
guidelines and then well performance
looks great I'm Lenny foam but this
older phone performance don't say that
word again what performance and now
you're back what if you say performance
three times he'll just magically appear
Ian joy no what are we doing here at
Udacity I thought we already had a
course on performance so we do and
that's why we actually don't need you it
was an accident the works just kind of
fell out of his mouth and we definitely
don't need you to go through need
absolutely no tournament you do you know
do you have a bad performing application
that you need help with I knew there was
something wrong here
well you know Chloe I know but you know
some performance stuff but maybe you can
help no no no no sorry no thank you but
you don't need your help the thing is if
we actually know what we're doing and we
don't need him to kind of jump in and
help us you guys we can go through this
ourselves
Joanna Joanna Joanna nonsense I'm here
to help why don't we go ahead and take a
look at things open up your application
on your phone and why don't you start by
telling me what you've been seeing in
some of the profiling tools that you've
been running your app in um well we have
actually haven't run any yet
like performance has been great are you
joking
is he joking did çoç are you people
punking me like are you recording it for
like a gag reel or something what's
going on here
can you just give me a minute we haven't
run any tools yet because we haven't
started working on perfect yet madam you
insult me performances is something you
just idly cast about and handle at the
end of your application oh when you
submit your app to the Play Store users
give negative feedback on it three times
more active than any other thing in your
application that they actually hate oh
that alone means that performance is
there something you cast off to the end
you bring it up to the front you should
be good at the whole life take a breath
hey breathing don't you to fall that
would be
you know terrible shame so we're
actually trying to get out here is that
we have all of these different perfect
tools that are available to help us see
it much of different problems and kind
of block us they're weird maybe there's
some issues right there's like Tracy
exactly just like Tracy oh yeah and we
actually have a whole Federation of
applications so you can also run a graph
with you thank you for jumping in your
knowledge is valuable I was talking well
we're trying to say here is there's more
than just trace you it doesn't end there
we actually have a different tool for a
bunch of different situations so maybe
you want to look at you know you're
rendering / - or maybe you want to see
how your memories being the point is
that you have a different tool for
different situations and you can
actually use several tools together to
narrow down where the real problems are
happening so you can focus your efforts
on fixing the real problem as opposed to
maybe hiding which and by the way we
talk about in great teal in our Android
performance course here at Udacity that
you can click on in the instructor notes
I know I know you made of course we all
know we got the tweet yeah I saw that to
you so coldly we really should be
testing performance before we should go
oh yeah absolutely uh some of the best
engineers I've ever worked with in my
career have all been performance minded
in fact some of the greatest companies
we have out there will actually create
unit tests entirely focused on
performance so that they can actually
find any performance regressions that
occur to the line of code that's checked
into their source tree there's some
really exciting stuff going on right now
that they're it's so exciting just like
your mad scientist lunch that you have
every month hey hey that's a little
below the belt what is your problem I am
here to help you guys summoned me here
to solve your problem that you have in
performance in your application and all
you've done is give me grief about this
what's causal I didn't summon you you
jumped in because you heard the word
performance and you care a lot which is
great except that maybe some other
people want to do their own perf work
and don't want you doing it for them
because believe it or not I know about
Android performance I'm good at Android
performance and I'm good enough to teach
other people about it okay so you think
you know what you're doing I do I do
prove it I will I'm being summoned this
isn't over
okay so now that he's gone I'll actually
walk you through the tools and you can
see what we're talking about without him
interrupting again</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
