entire common filter it goes through all
the measurement elements and it clearly
assumes there's as many measurements as
motions in the explain and it updates
the MU and Sigma using this recursive
formula over here we plug in the enth
measurement and the measurement
uncertainty it is the same with emotion
the prediction part over here it updates
the MU and Sigma recursively using the
nth motion and the motion uncertainty
and it prints all of those out so we hit
the Run button
I find that my first measurement update
gets me effectively 5.0 it's four point
nine eight and that makes sense because
we had a huge initial uncertainty and we
just above five with a relatively small
measurement uncertainty in effect the
resulting as Sigma square term is three
point nine eight which is better than
four and a thousand slightly better than
force it was slightly more certain than
the measurement itself we now apply the
motion of one we get to five point nine
our uncertainty increases by exactly two
from three point nine to five point nine
eight and then the next update comes in
at six and that gives us a measurement
of five point nine nine and our reduced
uncertainty of two point three nine and
then you go to move to the right again
by one which makes the prediction six
point nine nine uncertainty goes up we
measure seven you get to six point nine
nine almost seven and certainly goes
down we move to to the right measure
nine run to the right measure ten and
move one again the final thing is in
motion and if you look at the end result
our estimate is almost exactly 11 which
is the result of ten plus one and the
uncertainty is four point zero after the
motion and two point zero after the
measurement this code that you just
wrote implements a full common filter
for 1d so if we look at this we have an
update function that implements what
actually is a relatively simple equation
in a prediction function which is an
even simpler equation of just addition
and then we apply it to a measurement
sequence and a motion sequence with
certain uncertainties associated and
this little piece of code over here
gives you a
come and filter and 1d I find this video
mazing so let's plug in some other
values suppose you're really certain
about the initial position it's wrong
it's zero it should be five but it's
zero and now we assume a really small
uncertainty guess what's going to happen
to the final prediction as I hit the run
button we find this has an effect on the
final estimate it's not eleven it's only
ten point five in the way this takes
places initially after a first
measurement update we believe in the
position of 0 this is 1 point 2 4 to the
minus tenth but it really is small
uncertainty even smaller this one over
here we apply our motion update we have
1 we have a higher uncertainty and now
when the next measurement comes in 6 we
know more inclined to believe the
measurement because uncertainty is now
basically 2 as opposed to 0.001 so we
update our position to be 2 point 6 6 6
which is now a jump away from 1 and we
reduce our uncertainty motion comes in
three point six six uncertainty goes up
we know willing to update even more as
we see the 7 million to go to five point
one but not quite all the way because we
feel fairly confident long prior
estimate and this confidence makes it
all the way to the end when we predict
ten point five as opposed to 11 with a
visit uncertainty of three point nine
eight
so we've corrected some of it we were
able to drag it into the right direction
but not all the way because our false
initial belief have such a strong weight
in the overall equation</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
