behave in a particular way over time so
traits are connected directly to the
disposition to behave let's look at an
example here we see Miriam in barium
Miriam is usually very friendly watch
see someone cut her in the lunch line
and she was nice about it she holds the
door for people when they're walking in
someone even hits her car when they
weren't paying attention she was less
nice to the person in this situation but
tried to be understanding someone gave
her a million dollars and she was extra
nice to them now let's go to bury him
who's usually not very friendly somebody
cut him in line and he rudely makes him
know how wrong they were to cut him
someone's walking up and he doesn't hold
the door for them someone hits his car
when they weren't paying attention and
he's really really rude about it someone
gives him a million dollars and then we
see him be kind of nice to that person</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
