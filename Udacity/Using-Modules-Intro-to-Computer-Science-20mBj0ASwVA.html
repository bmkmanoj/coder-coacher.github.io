take all this code that we wrote fairly
painstakingly in the first three units
of the class and I know that now that
you're fairly experienced programmer it
doesn't seem too hard to write this code
but this code is actually very fragile
it only works on very specific ways of
encoding link targets and we could
replace that with much simpler code that
uses far fewer lines and works much
better we're doing that by importing
from bs4 which is the beautiful suit
library the beautiful soup definition
which allows us to create an object that
represents a web page here we're passing
in the contents of the page just like we
were doing and get all links and the
beautiful soup module provides
definitions that give us a very easy way
to extract all the links from a web page
in the first part of the course where we
were writing this code ourselves but we
wanted to really understand how to do
things and our goal was to learn about
programming if you're actually trying to
solve problems you're much better off
finding a module like beautiful soup
where someone's already put a lot of
effort into figuring out how to do this
in the right way and written the tool
that works much more robustly on much
more complex web pages than the code
that we wrote does so modules are real
big win and we can use this without
worrying about it polluting our
namespace because we know the only name
that we've imported here is the name
beautiful soup and we've replaced these
18 lines of code with six lines that if
you understand what the module does are
much easier to understand and much
simpler than having to understand all 18
lines and they work a lot better so
modules are huge win they make it very
easy to share code and one of the things
you should be thinking about as you
develop more programs especially if
you're developing them to actually solve
problems not just to learn about
programming if there's a module that
already exists that you can use to make
your coding much more simple</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
