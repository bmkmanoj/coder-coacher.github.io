news the bad news first is that this is
the last lesson in the course the good
news though this is gonna be the most
awesome lesson in the course
so to recap what we've learned so far in
Lesson one we talked about what is UX
and and the difference between UI and UX
unless than two we talked about the user
centric design process and got into
personas and use cases in lesson three
we talked about the mobile user and
talked about different mobile user
constraints yeah in Lesson four we're
gonna talk about not about constraints
but about the capabilities that are
unlocked by mobile and the amazing
things that you can do on Android to
blow your users minds and create amazing
five-star applications so now as Moe
everybody wants to know how do we get
closer to making five-star apps that's a
good question
first we're gonna understand the amazing
capabilities that the Android platform
has to offer then we're gonna imagine
how to use these capabilities to create
some really kick-ass features for your
apps and through all this we're gonna
learn that context is what helps us to
deliver five-star applications to our
users
so now as well what do you mean by
context so context is all about a user
and what they're doing in a physical
environment when they're interacting
with your application now before we get
into the details of what context is made
up off you're probably a weapon a
desktop developer so let's talk about
the differences between the Android
platform and web and desktop there's
some fundamental similarities between
web desktop and mobile machines I mean
after all they actually collect data
from input sources they process that
information and they produce output so
what are some of the inputs do you think
that are similar between web desktop and
Android well they both have keyboards
and you can enter information that way
and they also both have pointing devices
and they both have a network connection
yeah there are a lot of similar input
sources but the power of Android truly
lies in the input sources or sensors
that are available in Android that are
simply not available on web and desktop
one simple example is GPS so can you
name all the other input sources that
are available on Android that are not
available on web and desktop</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
