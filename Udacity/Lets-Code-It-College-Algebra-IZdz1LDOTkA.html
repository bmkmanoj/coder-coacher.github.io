general statement about what the output
based on a general input for this
function we're talking about here it
would be if the info is X and the output
have to be X plus 2 since the function
of our function is to increase all input
values by 2 so to illustrate this point
a little bit differently we're going to
do some very very basic computer
programming now don't worry if you've
never done anything like this before
this is just illustrate how simple
functions work you'll never be tested on
this or anything this is just for you to
explore and have fun and maybe even
understand things a little bit better
and what we're going to do is use one
particular programming language called
Python to create the same increase by to
function that we just did now remember
that we said in a general case of
wanting to increase by 2 we take an
input of X and then have our output be X
plus 2 so the same thing is happening up
here in these two lines of code the
letters d e f stanford to fine and
they're saying that we're going to
define or create a function which is
named increased by 2 and that function
is going to take in some input as letter
X in this case as the general case and
then that function is going to do some
stuff and then spit out this output X
plus 2 so these two lines of code are
basically creating the machine that this
function is the machine that transforms
whatever input value it gets into some
output value now please notice here that
we do have parenthesis here around the
input value this has absolutely nothing
to do with multiplication these
parenthesis just indicate this is what
we're calling the input let's try it out
let's see if this function works now
let's say that I wanted to use an input
of 7 or plug in seven in place of X in
my increase by to function what number
do you think this program is going to
spit out in the end now again you don't
need to know anything about how programs
actually work all you need to do is
think about the relationship between the
input here and the output here and see
then what the output would be if seven
is the input please put your answer in
this box over here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
