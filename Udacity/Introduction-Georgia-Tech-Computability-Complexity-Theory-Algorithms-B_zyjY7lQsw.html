Fourier transform and apply it in order
to obtain an efficient algorithm fork
involving two sequences of numbers if
you've seen the Fourier transform before
in the context of mathematics or physics
or engineering this lesson may have a
different flavor from what you are used
to we won't be using it to solve
differential equations or to
characterize the behavior of an
electrical circuit instead we'll be
focused on the much more mundane task of
multiplying polynomials and doing it
quickly this algorithmic aspect of the
Fourier transform is actually almost as
old as the Fourier transform itself
appearing in an early 19th century paper
by Gauss on interpolation the transform
itself by the way gets its paper from
jean-baptiste for EAS 1807 paper on the
propagation of heat through solids
Gauss's trick seems to have largely been
forgotten until Cooley and two key paper
published a paper on the fast Fourier
transform in 1965 to key was apparently
somewhat reluctant to publish the paper
because he thought it was a simple
observation and the how-to questions of
algorithms were still considered
second-class at the time well much has
changed since then their paper is now
one of the most cited in scientific
literature and the idea is considered
one of the most elegant in algorithm
design</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
