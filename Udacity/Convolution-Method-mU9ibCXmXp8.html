this is the mathematical formulation of
the convolution method some of you may
remember the cross-correlation method
you might actually find some
similarities and we'll compare them
side-by-side in a bit for giving you a
sense of how what are the difference
between two one thing to note in here is
we would denote this by a symbol here so
now rather than using the symbol which
was this for cross correlation we use a
star for doing convolutions again the H
kernel and F and it basically allows you
to generate an input or output G one
thing we notice is that basically in how
we use cross correlation the filter is
flipped in both dimensions so first its
flipped bottom to top that is the top
row is now at the bottom here and of
course the other flip is minutes right
to left and then we can apply cross
correlation so in essence we would have
been able to do cross correlation we're
using this formulation if you take in
the kernel and process it to have two
flips one a flip in the horizontal axis
so the top row would be switched with
the bottom and then the second flip very
will actually do a flip from the right
to left with the right row and the left
rows would be swamped so that would be a
complete flip to generate a new kernel
and if you applied this kernel in this
formulation this would become a cool
into a cross correlation method</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
