the fourth example comes along again the
red line shows that this is a negative
example of the concept because this is a
negative example we must specialize the
most general concept characterizations
available at the moment we can begin by
checking whether we need to specialize
this particular general concept but wait
this general concept characterization
already excludes this negative example
this says the energy happens when I go
to sams and this has Bob's in it so this
already excludes it I do not have to
specialize it anymore let us look at
this general model does this need to be
specialized in order to excluded yes
because of the current stage this
includes this particular example it has
cheap here this is cheap this is any
hair and this has particular elements
for them this means that this concept
characterization must be specialized in
a way it excludes this negative example
and yet the new specialization is
consistent with the most specialized
characterization at present it is
tempting to see the two pathways as
converging here because this is
identical to that but we also have this
branch hanging and this brand says that
I'm allergic to any meal at sams not
just a cheap meal so we're not done yet
at this stage there is one other element
to consider if there is a node that lies
on a pathway starting for the most
general concept characterization that is
subsumed by a node that comes from
another pathway starting from the same
journal concept characterization then I
want to prune that particular node the
reason I want to prune this notice
because this note is subsumed by this
node so this node is true I don't have
to carry this around if I am allergic to
any meal at sams I don't have to specify
that ability to achieve meet exams thus
I can prove this particular pathway and
I'm left with only this particular
pathway at this point in the processing
based on the examples that have been
encountered so far the only two
possibilities I am either allergic to
everything at sams or am allergic to
every cheap meal at times</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
