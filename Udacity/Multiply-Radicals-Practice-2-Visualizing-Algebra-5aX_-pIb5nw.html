if you found those two for the first one
we want to start by multiplying our
numbers together and our variables
together we'll have 20 times 2 which
equals 40 X to the fifth times x squared
which is X to the 7th the y squared
times y to the 4th which is y to the six
since we're under a cube root we want to
find factors that have here three times
we can split up 40 into 8 times 5 since
the cube root of 8 equals 2 we have to
leave the five inside of our cube root
since this factor doesn't appear three
times it's not a perfect cube finally we
deal with our variables by using power
divided by root 7 divided by 3 is 2
remainder 1 so we'll have x squared on
the outside and X to the one on the
inside the cube root of Y to the 6 is
just 6 divided by 3 so y squared comes
out this gives us our final result I
hope you found it for the second one we
want to start by distributing you three
root 2 to each of these radical terms
I'll have 3 root 2 times root 18 and 3
root 2 times negative 2 root 6 for the
first term will multiply these two
radicals together to get 3 route 36 for
our second term will multiply 3 times
negative 2 which equals negative 6 and
root 2 times root 6 which equals route
12 the square root of thirty-six equals
6 and then we can break down the square
root of 12 into the square root of four
times three we simplify further by
multiplying 3 times 6 which is 18 and
then we take the square root of four
which is too we multiply these two
numbers together to give us our final
answer 18-12 root 3 nice work if you
found that one as well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
