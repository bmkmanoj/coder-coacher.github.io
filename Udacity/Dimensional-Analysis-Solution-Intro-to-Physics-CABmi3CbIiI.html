figuring out what the units of energy
work well from equals MC squared I know
the energy has units of well mass times
speed speed is meters per second so
length over time and since that's
squared we can put a square on both of
these now I don't really like having
this 2 in the denominator so i'm going
to write energy has units of mass to the
one length through the 2 and T to the
negative 2 we know this whole term must
also have units of energy so I've
rewritten as H bar squared over
something with mass and length squared
because M stands for mass and X is some
distance and we know that must have
units of energy so I can move this mess
up here and this l squared up there to
tell me that H bar squared has units of
mass to the two lengths the four and T
to the negative 2 when i take the square
root these exponents i'll get reduced by
half and i have my answer 1 2 and
negative 1 if you've got that I'm very
impressed</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
