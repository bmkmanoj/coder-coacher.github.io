partition method is a specific instance
of this systematic functional testing
approach so a specific instance of the
steps that we represented here and as I
mentioned earlier on this is not the
only way in which you can generate test
cases something from a functional
specification in particular this step in
which we identify relevant inputs and
then we combine them to generate test
case specifications can also be done in
different ways and we're going to look
at one of these ways which is through
the construction of a model and the
reason why I want to talk about models
is because model-based testing is also
fairly popular in industry and fairly
used in practice in model-based testing
the way in which we go from
specifications to test cases is through
the construction of a model where a
model is an abstract representation of
the software under test also in this
case there are many possible models that
we can use and what we're going to do
we're going to focus on a specific kind
of model and I'll just point you to
additional sources of information in
case you're interested in seeing other
examples</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
