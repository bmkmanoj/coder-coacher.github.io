but there are some helpful facts that
can use to solve logarithmic equations
the first is that if a to the x equals a
to the y then we know that X must equal
Y we saw this earlier in the problem
three to the x equals twenty-seven we
rewrote 27 as three cubed and since we
have three to the x equal to 3 to the Y
we can set this exponent equal to this
one the next fact that can help us solve
equations with logarithms is that if a
to the x equals B to the X then we know
that the base a must equal the base B we
see this in a problem like this x
squared equals 5 squared well we know
since these are both squares then X must
be equal to 5 in order for this amount
on the left to be equal to this amount
on the right the last fact that we'll
use is that if log of base B of M equals
log base B of n then we know that M must
equal n since we're taking the log of
base B we know that these two numbers
must be the same in order for the
logarithms of those numbers to both be
the same as well we haven't seen an
example like this yet but we'll use this
idea in the upcoming problems</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
