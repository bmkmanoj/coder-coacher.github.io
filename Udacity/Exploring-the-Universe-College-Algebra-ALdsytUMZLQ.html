functions but now we're going to take a
short break from them to look at
representing very small and very large
numbers imagine you want to travel to
the far far reaches of the known
universe out past Mars right past Pluto
out pass through voyagers sending back
images far beyond our own galaxy past
our nearest neighbor Andromeda on and on
and on traveling over while traveling a
very long distance a distance so long
that it's hard to express with words we
could write this out as five another
five and then twenty two zeros if we
wanted to talk about it in miles in
kilometers this would be 88 and then 22
zeros or perhaps you want to examine
some bacteria how big is a tiny organism
like this if we wanted to talk about how
long the bacteria is we could write it
like this zero a decimal point then six
zeros and a five in meters apart from it
being really boring to write out all
those zeroes it's easy to make a mistake
when we write out numbers like this and
it's also hard to read we really need a
better way to write quantities like this
and guess what there is one it's called
scientific notation and as you've
already seen it's very useful especially
when we're talking about very big in
very small quantities let's get ready to
talk about it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
