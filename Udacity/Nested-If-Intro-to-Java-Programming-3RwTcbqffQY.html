returns the plural form of a word we'll
make some simplifying assumptions
because plurals in English have a lot of
rules
check out the Wikipedia article if you
don't believe me or if you just think
phonetics are interesting we're just
gonna look at regular plurals like dish
which becomes dishes or cherry which
becomes cherries or o'clock which
becomes clocks here are the rules I want
you to implement for the initial version
if you want to make a more comprehensive
version nothing stopping you but get
these ones down first if the word ends
in Y preceded by a consonant take away
the Y and add IES like in cherries if
the word ends in Y preceded by a vowel
just add s like in de which becomes days
if the word ends in O s SH or CH add es
like in dishes otherwise just add an S
you can use the is vowel and is
consonant methods that you wrote before
as well as another method that I added
the method is takes an index and a
letter to compare it to and returns true
if the letter at that index matches the
letter there's also a tester program
with a bunch of examples of correct
plural spellings of words as a bonus
what happens if you give your program a
single letter word like ah what if you
give it an empty string does it crash</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
