overflows remember we started with the
idea of buffer overflows and then I
quickly sort of narrowed on to CAC
buffer overflows or oil flows on the
stack the other variations of buffer
overflows and the number of reasons for
those so we want to talk about these
different types or variations of buffer
overflows before we actually start
talking about some defenses against
these kind of attacks that exploit
buffer overflow so the first variation
we're going to talk about is what is
called return to Lib see Lib C is the
library C library all our programs use
library functions so remember when I was
talking about buffer overflow shellcode
modifying return address our assumption
was that we're going to return address
is going to be modified to point to some
place where we are able to place the
shellcode and that could be on the stack
itself in that case you would transfer
control to the shellcode and execute it
off the stack because that's where the
code is stored the shellcode is stored
we're gonna talk about some defenses
where systems don't allow you to do that
so it's not easy to find room for your
shellcode on the stack and get it
executed so the variations of where you
should return you don't have to return
to code that you explicitly write as
shellcode but you can return to a
function in the library so the return
address is going to be modified the
return address that we had on the stack
it's going to be modified to point to a
standard library function so the
assumption here is that you'll be able
to figure out the address of the library
function and once you have that that's
what is going to overwrite so when you
do the stack buffer overflow you make
sure that library function address is
what gets returned into the return
address field on the stack frame so why
do we want to do that why do you want to
return to a library function well if you
return to the right kind of library
function and you're able to set up the
arguments for it or the parameters
before the call happens on the stack
then you can exit
a library function with arguments and
parameters of your choice so think about
the library function called system the
system call if you look at it carefully
you can ask it to execute bin CSS or
some CSS or something like that
and as a result of executing this
function call you would launch a command
shell that's what our shell code was
doing before now we can get the same
result by executing a library function
and the reason it would do that for us
is that before we make the call to it we
go to it by returning from this function
where we were able to overflow the
buffer we're gonna set the stack in such
a way that the arguments actually are
going to be such so for example I said
the system calls you to execute been
something it's going to be such that
when you hit the system library function
the library functions system it's
actually going to do what it you want it
to do in particular give you a shell
command a command shell so when that
happens you actually then going to go
execute code that you didn't have to
craft and place on the stack you just
executing a library function and you
manipulating its input by properly
crafting that input on the stack and
before you make this library function
call and then it's going to do your
bidding if you are that hacker
so in Lib C the thing to remember is
that the return address is modified to
point to a chosen library function and
we set up its input in such a way that
the execution of library function with
that input allows the attacker to sort
of gain control the same way we were
able to do before with shell code</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
