about value is really important for
in-app purchases what else can a game
developer do to improve their a net
purchases you also want to be clear
about how to use purchases in your game
lots of game is tutorials to show you
how to use new items when you show a
player how to use it in that purchase
they're much more likely to use them in
the future also make sure to have
variety in your purchases to keep people
interested and think about introducing
new items as people play the game so you
could introduce a group of items the
first day someone plays a game and then
a different group of items a week later
yep variety is a great way to keep
players interested in your item and one
place though you should avoid variety is
your price points most successful games
offer between one and five price points
for all there in app purchases this goes
back to clarity because the value for
items that each price plant has to be
very clear and too many options can get
confusing so to improve your in-app
purchases teach players how to use them
off a variety and be clear about value</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
