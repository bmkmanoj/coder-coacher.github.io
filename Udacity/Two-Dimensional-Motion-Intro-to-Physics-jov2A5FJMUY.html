two dimensional motion and this is where
things get really interesting so far
we've only talked about one-dimensional
motion and that's motion in a straight
line either purely up-and-down motion or
purely left and right motion but what
happens when you have some combination
well then we get the motion we're
familiar with this is the sort of motion
that describes a cricket ball as it
bounces towards the batsman or an arrow
as it sails towards its target or
parachutist who's just jumped out of a
plane now before we talk about our
modern-day understanding of
two-dimensional motion and in fact
Galileo's understanding let's talk about
what Aristotle thought of
two-dimensional motion in Aristotle's
mind and this is Aristotle over here of
course objects for example a ball thrown
into the sky move in a straight line
until they run out of what he called
impetus at that point the abjured
revolves straight down and land
somewhere on the ground now before you
continue why don't you try this throw a
small object like a coin or a pencil in
frontier field of view and look at what
you see it's actually really difficult
to see what's going on in fact it was
until Galileo came around that the true
path of an object in two-dimensional
motion was known that path is what's
called a parabola so we know that
two-dimensional motion is parabolic but
so what parabolic is just a word what
does it mean in fact can we use this
word to somehow describe two dimensional
motion mathematically in physics
prediction is power and what I mean by
prediction is can we develop our
understanding of motion in such a way
that we can explain and predict
mathematically how an object will move
before we actually throw that object
let's say we can and that's what we will
do in the rest of this unit</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
