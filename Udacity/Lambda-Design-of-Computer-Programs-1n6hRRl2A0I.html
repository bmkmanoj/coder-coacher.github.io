write a new one let's say u equals me
squared and we're treating these
formulas as strings now when we
substitute numbers into this we get
something like 1 2 3 equals 4 5 squared
now what happens when we call eval on
this string what a vowel has to do is it
takes its input which is a string and
then it has a process of parsing that
string into a parse tree and the parse
tree would say something like this is a
comparison and it has an operator which
is a number which is one two three and
another operand which is an expression
which has a number 45 and then the
exponentiation operator and then the
number two and python bills up a data
structure that looks something like that
there's another operation of code
generation in which Python takes this
tree and says in order to evaluate this
tree I'm going to do something like load
the number one to three and then load
the number 45 and then do an operation
on that and so on and so on and then
return the result so that's a lot of
work to build up this tree generate the
code and then finally the final
operation after we've come up with this
is to execute this code and come up with
an answer which in this case would be
false now this is a lot of work for a
valve to do and it seems like there's a
lot of duplicate work because we're
going to do this for every permutation
of the digits but each time we go
through this part of the work the
parsing is going to look exactly the
same with the exception of the specific
numbers down here at the bottom but the
rest of the parse tree is going to to
look the same and similarly this part of
the
the cogeneration will also look the same
except these numbers will differ and
we're going to have to repeat that over
and over again what we'd like is an
approach where we can only do these two
parts once and then pass in the specific
numbers and then get our final result
back but one thing i should say is that
the eval function doesn't take a
statement like this function definition
it takes an expression and furthermore
we don't really need this name f that
was kind of arbitrary we'd be fine with
having an expression that represents a
function but doesn't have a name
associated with it and then we can pass
that directly to eval and it turns out
there is a way to do that in Python
there is a keyword that creates a
function as an expression and that
keyword is lambda it's kind of a funny
keyword I would have preferred them to
use function or fun or maybe just death
and leave the name out but they chose
lambda it's based on the lambda calculus
the Greek letter lambda which is a
branch of formal mathematics defining
functions and the syntax is fairly
similar to the syntax of a definition of
a function except we leave the name out
it's an anonymous function with no name
it also turns out for some reason we
leave out the parentheses so we just say
lambda y.o.u m.e then a colon and we
leave out the return and then we just
put in the rest of the code 100 times
