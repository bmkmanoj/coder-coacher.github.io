with the most general satisfiability
problem rather we can restrict ourselves
to a simpler case where the boolean
formula has a particular structure
called conjunctive normal form or CNF
like this one here first consider the
operators the V indicates a logical or
the wedge indicates a logical and and
the bar over top of one of the variables
indicates logical not for one of these
formulas we need to define a collection
of variables XY and Z in this example
and these variables appear in the
formula as literals a literal can be
either a variable or the variables
negation for example this X or this Y
bar etc at the next higher level we have
clauses which are disjunction of
literals
you could also say logical ORS of
literals one Clause is what lies in
between a pair of parenthesis and
finally we have the formula as a whole
which is a conjunction of clauses that
is to say all the clauses get ANDed
together thus this whole formula is in
conjunctive normal form in general there
can be more than two clauses that get
ANDed together that covers the terms
we'll use for the structure of a CNF
formula as for satisfiability itself we
say that a boolean formula is
satisfiable if there is a truth
assignment for the formula a way of
assigning variables true and false such
that the formula evaluates to true the
CNF satisfiability problem is given a
CNF formula determine if that formula
has a satisfying assignment clearly this
problem is in NP since given any truth
assignment it takes time polynomial in
the number of literals to evaluate the
formula thus we've accomplished the
first part of showing that
satisfiability is np-complete the other
part showing that every problem in NP is
polynomial time reducible to it will be
considerably more difficult</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
