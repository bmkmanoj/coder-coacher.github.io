body might metabolize drugs differently
from someone else but what about all
those traits that aren't so simple they
don't just have one way or another the
complex traits like diabetes or heart
disease yeah especially for many
diseases the genetics is complex we need
to look at multiple snv's to figure out
what your risk of the diseases so for
one example we can go and take a look at
your results for coronary heart disease
okay so Matt let's go to your results
and then look under surveillance health
risks and that's where many of these
complex disease reports are that involve
multiple snv's okay look so this is my
health risk page i'm sure a lot of
people are interested in this and it
seems to list them in order of elevated
risk here first and we have a list of
them from my risk down to the average
risk here so it looks like I have
elevated risk for psoriasis Alzheimer's
chronic kidney disease multiple
sclerosis but in many case it might be
slightly higher than average but not
much higher than yeah I see here that
for example multiple sclerosis is 0
point four seven percent of the average
is like point three four right and when
especially when the average is low you
can have a higher than average and it
still can be low so let's scroll down to
coronary heart disease all right so it
actually says this is under my decreased
risk category means low in average so my
risk is 32.9 percent let's click on the
report to get the details of where that
estimate comes from okay and let's
scroll down and it says this is
information from Matthew cook and it's
under the assumption that you have
European ancestry mostly and this is for
the rage age range between age 45 and 79
so basically what's getting calculated
here is your risk of coronary heart
disease between the your ages went
between your ages of 45 and 79 so before
age 79 what is your chance of having a
coronary heart disease and it looks like
the average is 47 is actually not that
far from fifty percent so then this and
this is for men with European ancestry
it's actually quite high for the average
man the risk of coronary heart says here
that I'm actually lower than this nice
little visual to sort of represent that
out of a population of a hundred about a
third one you're you're with people with
your genetics your wrist seems to be
about one in three mm-hmm thirty-three
percent now how is this risk determined
i mean if i scroll down scroll and keep
swelling will see some details and we'll
see all these little bars each bar
refers to a different snv also each one
of these represents a different possible
change in my DNA that's right that's
right and some of them give you
protection and those are the green bars
and some increase your risk and those
are the red bars oh wow oh if I hover
over it'll do the gene and the that's
right and your genotype so essentially
the number that you report for me is
actually a combination of all that's
right together that's right you know is
we multiply across all the different
snv's to give you an overall average
risk for people who have similar
genetics to you we're going to focus a
lot more on the idea of heritability and
i love the action variation in complex
traits in lesson 9 but i'm just really
curious if we actually look at someone
else who doesn't have a european back
right let's look at Roy King can we do
yes we can so Roy actually does have
quite a bit of of European ancestry okay
but this is still assuming that this is
really focusing on his European ancestry
and give it hit so is estimate shows
somewhat higher than average a little
bit less a little less than average but
I'm not as low as your risk right and so
I'm actually curious too let's let's
change something else we're going back
to my coronary heart disease report if i
change the age range to let's say 45 to
54 so that's basically saying in that
age range age range what is your
chaverim site right that's much less
what we expect right people who are
younger have lesser risk of heart yes if
you compare that to the top age range
which is 75 79
it's going to be quite a bit higher
because a lot of your lot of your risk
for heart disease is when you're older
so it's oh wow yeah quite a bit higher
so yours is still lower than average but
it's a lot of risk for any of these
diseases is waited too late in life and
just to be clear this doesn't mean that
I'm not going to have coronary heart
disease ever this just means that my
risk for it is lower than average that's
right everyone has some risk but you can
see as you when you compare the age
range results that it's still low now
especially in the next 10 years I mean
you're still young so your risk for
having heart disease in the next 10
years is low but by the time you get
into your late 70s it starts to go up a
bit okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
