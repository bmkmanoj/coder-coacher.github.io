we've been doing algebra right here
these two symbols the square and the
triangle that we assigned to replace the
words that we had written earlier are
called variables in algebra we make a
distinction between numbers and
variables numbers are well numbers like
three million or 100,000 and variables
are generally represented by symbols or
single letters a variable doesn't have a
set value like a number does instead its
value is allowed to vary depending on
what we decide that it should equal
we'll talk more about how we make
decisions about that soon numbers will
appear either as constant terms on their
own just numbers like 3 million right
here or in terms that combine numbers
and variables like this last one on the
right when multiplied by a variable or
set of variables a number is called a
coefficient so again going back to our
variables I could have chosen any two
symbols I wanted to represent these two
quantities right here the square and the
triangle I didn't have to choose a
triangle I didn't have to choose a
square in fact picking these two
particular symbols is actually pretty
unconventional in math to give you a
preview of what you're usually going to
be seeing during this course I'll write
this equation out with more typical
notation we'll most often see the
letters x and y as our variables in
equations in algebra you can see I've
also removed the dollar signs and the
commas from the original equation down
here to make this equation look a little
bit more clean and strictly mathematical
you'll notice that I also sneakily
deleted the multiplication sign we had
in the top equation and didn't write it
down here at the bottom when we have
single terms that involve both numbers
and variables multiplied together we
don't usually write the multiplication
sign in like I did at the top as long as
we write the symbols directly next to
each other with nothing between
multiplication is assumed to be
happening between them it's like there's
an invisible multiplication sign written
right here I'm going to erase that
though to remind us that we're not
usually going to see any multiplication
signs written between numbers and
variables although people doing math
often use the variables Y and X in their
equation
I really want you to remember that this
is not necessary triangles and squares
are just as useful as X's and Y's no
matter what symbol you choose to write a
variable with the power that it has is
still the same it acts as a slot where
we can insert different numbers to make
terms and expressions take on different
values so maybe I set this first
variable equal to 3 and the second equal
to negative 1 or maybe this is negative
1/2 and this is 23 in certain situations
there will be restrictions placed on
what different variables can equal but
until we have more information about
what they equal we leave them written as
variables showing that their values are
still sort of a mystery to us</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
