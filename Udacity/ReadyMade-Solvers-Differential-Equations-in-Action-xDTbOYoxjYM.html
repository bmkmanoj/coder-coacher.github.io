cases you can of course use somebody
else's solver there's lots of ready-made
software for that first of all there's
general mathematical software
application packages which can do
differential equations but which also
can do lots of other stuff first of all
matlab and it's clones such as octave or
Scilab Wolfram Alpha if you manage your
formulate your problem in one line
mathematica and tons of others second
there's dedicated modeling and
simulation software such as simulink
which comes with matlab COMSOL
multiphysics and Wolfram system model on
and PS tool which is based on as the
name says Python and there's lots of
code libraries that you can use to build
your own application one important
library to mention here is sigh pi
integrate obviously for Python again to
create plausible motion for games
there's a number of physics engines and
finally there are cookbooks providing
snippets of code to be reused or adapted
the most prominent one of these are the
numerical recipes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
