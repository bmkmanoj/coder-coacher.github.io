notion that you could take part of one
abstract syntax tree and replace it with
something else in order to make the
program faster or use less power the
cardinal rule of optimization was you
can't change the meaning of the program
you have to respect the formal semantics
or at least that's what I've always told
you but what if we break that law what
if we want to change the meaning of a
program for example what if your program
currently has a bug and I want to change
it so that the bug isn't there what if I
want to fix your program optimize it so
that it is more correct instead of being
faster I've worked on just this sort of
research project we call it evolutionary
program repair it involves using genetic
algorithms or genetic programming
computational analogs of real-world
biological processes like crossover and
mutation we maintain a population of
candidate programs that may fix your bug
just like you can imagine a population
of animals on an island and then
survival of the fittest allows some of
them to stay and the rest to die out if
you're interested in this sort of
research I affectionately call it
building skynet because we're building a
program that builds other programs there
should be links below but one of the
things that I want you to take away is
that the concepts that we're covering in
this class notions like abstract syntax
trees or replacing one expression with
another can be used in different
contexts to great effect it just
requires creativity to know when you can
bend the rules without breaking them
that creativity is the essence of
