impression from what I just presented
there because I did this sort of odd
trick that's not really very kosher
specifically when I gave the example of
a teacher asking questions to to lead
the learner to a particular hypothesis I
allowed to teach her to ask any possible
question in the universe of possible
questions right so the teacher could
construct a question and in this
particular case that that specifically
had a yes answer for the target
hypothesis and a no answer everywhere
else and that just simply doesn't happen
in any realistic learning question so we
need to think a little bit more about
the question of what happens when the
teacher is constrained with respect to
the kinds of queries that it can suggest
so I'm gonna I'm gonna set up classic
computational learning theory hypothesis
class and we'll go through some examples
about what happens when the teacher is
constrained in this way so let's imagine
that our input space is basically K bit
inputs so x1 through XK and the
hypothesis class and literals or their
negation so here's a here's a concrete
example here's a hypothesis that is in
this set x1 and x3 and not x5 we're
gonna connect together some of these
variables not necessarily all of them
and some of them can be negated and it's
all the connectors have to be ants
all right so chars let's make sure that
that you understand this so let's let's
look at some inputs all right so let's
say our input is this x1 is 0 X 2 is 1
x3 0 X 4 is 1 X 5 is 1 what is this
formula going to evaluate in this case
ok so 0 is false and 1 is true I assume
because that's what we do in these
things X 2 and X 4 no matter I just have
to look at X 1 X 3 and X 5 so X 1 had
better be true and it isn't so I already
know the answer it's false very good all
right let's let's try a couple more of
these
ok so I would do the same thing I did
before I would look at X 1 X 3 and X 5
so in this case X 1 cleverly I've
noticed is 1 so it doesn't give me the
answer right away because you're an evil
teacher X 3 is also 1 but X 5 is 1 and
according to hypothesis it has to be 0
for this to be true so 0
I can do the same kind of thing for the
third line so x1 is true like it needs
to be but x3 is false
instead of being true so also zero and
then in the bottom let's see x1 is true
which it needs to be x3 is true which it
needs to be and x5 is false which it
needs to be so the output is one very
good all right I got it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
