people an idea of your game content but
screenshots let you show them in detail
the best screenshots show what's unique
and fun about your game here are some
good screenshots from the game temple
run the very first image is of the main
character running away from something
into a temple it shows all the main
aspects of the game a character who runs
and collects coins with a clean visual
the second image emphasis a detail the
coins that we saw in the first image and
the text helpfully explains what they do
and the third screenshot shows a special
feature and you'll notice that all of
these images have some text that helps
describe the images in general you'll
want to communicate visually but it's ok
to have some supporting text that
doesn't take away from the image after
someone looks at your screenshots if
they're still in the fence they'll read
your game description the description
should be clear and short and talk about
your games main features for example
temple runs description gives a bit of
back story about the player running away
from demon monkeys and collecting coins
and then goes on to describe how to play
the game with swipes and taps it
describes the gameplay goals and
obstacles so use your screenshots and
description wisely to describe gameplay
goals and obstacles</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
