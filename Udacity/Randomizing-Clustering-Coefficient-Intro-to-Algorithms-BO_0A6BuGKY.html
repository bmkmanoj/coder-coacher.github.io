would have realized that what you need
to do to compute an expected value the
sum over all values that it can take on
the probability of that value times the
value itself though what that amounts to
is summing over all pairs W and X that
our neighbors to V we sum whether they
kept their either connected or they're
not connected and that's represented by
the sea WX thing and we need to multiply
that by the probability that we pick
that particular W and X well all the WX
is are picked uniformly at random and
the number of different pairings of them
is the degree of V times the degree of V
minus 1/2 that's the number of different
ways you can pair up a set of size DV
the reciprocal of that is now the
probability that we pick any particular
pair but this is independent of C WX so
really we can move this out front and
just do it as 2 times the degree of 2
degree minus 1 times whether or not the
two nodes are connected and all that
summed up for all of the W and X but the
thing that I would like you to realize
is this is exactly this so the expected
value of randomly choosing a pair and
checking if they're connected is the
same as actually computing this this
particular piece of the clustering
coefficient formula and the same trick
works in terms of the number of of the
vertices so if the vertex is chosen at
random and then this quantity that is
evaluated for that vertex the expected
value of that is exactly the clustering
coefficient so what that means we can
iterate this particular expression that
I put braces around and average that and
if we do well if we did that forever if
we did that infinitely often it would be
exactly the expected value which would
be exactly the clustering coefficient
but since we can't do it forever we'll
run it for a certain amount of time and
we'll hope that it gets close let me
show you how it gets close over time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
