recursion we're given a recursive
formula for the Sterling numbers which
is s of n K equals k x s of n minus 1 k
plus s of n minus 1 k minus 1 what we
need to think about though is the base
case which isn't given so when do we
stop well if we have some objects and we
want to split them up if we have more
piles that we're going to split them in
sum pyar will be empty and that's not
allowed so that means that if we have
more piles and piles is the K and object
is the N if we have more piles and
objects we want to return 0 we can't do
it so that's one case if we look at our
formula we need to stop in other cases
as well we can't just return 0 all the
time because then I'll sum will be 20 so
what happens when these two values are
the same well if the two values are the
same if N equals k then how many ways
are there of spitting up the objects
into that the same number of piles as
there are objects well it's just one way
the other case we need to consider or we
can consider is if K is one what if we
want to split the objects up into one
pile well there's only one way to do
that so we can return one there as well
so now to look at the code and i'm just
going to code those two conditions if we
have fewer objects than piles then there
are no ways to arrange the objects if we
have the same number of objects as piles
or if we have just one pile then there's
one way to do that and if we're in
neither of those cases then we're going
to return the formula that we were given
the recursive formula and that completes
the Sterling number part of the question
for the bell numbers we just need to sum
the Sterling numbers
for k equals 1 up to n as stated so we
need a variable to keep track of the
total that we're going to return and
then we need to step through the values
of K from 1 up to n so 4k in the range 1
up to n plus 1 don't forget the plus one
on the end because rain stops one before
second input number and then we just
need to add the Sterling number n K and
finally we need to return the total</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
