CPU scheduling and exokernel in order to
facilitate this course service maintains
a linear vector of time slots so time is
divided into these epochs T 1 T 2 T 3
and so on
and every time quantum has a begin and
end and these time Quantum's represents
the time that is allocated to the
library operating systems that live on
top of exokernel and the time quantum is
bound by the beginning markers for each
library operating system each library
operating system gets to mark its time
quantum at startup in this linear vector
of time slots so for instance OS one may
say that I get this time slot I get this
time slot maybe some of the time start
and so on and similarly os/2 marks its
spots in this linear vector of time
slots so CPU scheduling in exokernel is
essentially looking at this linear
vector of time slots and asking the
question in this time quantum which is
the library operating system that should
be running on the processor and there is
a start time for the time quantum than
the end time for the time quantum and
let's say OS 1 is now running on the CPU
when the timer interrupts goes off at
this end point control is transferred by
exokernel to the library operating
system to do any saving that it has to
do of the context and the time that is
allowed for a library operating system
to do the saving and restoring of
context at the point of a context which
is bounded and if an operating system
misbehaves let's say that OS one when
exokernel says it's time for you to save
your context and give back the processor
to me so that I can schedule it for some
other operating system and let's say OS
1 takes more time than it is allowed to
at the point of this context which in
that case what will happen is exokernel
remember that OS 1 misbehaved
take time off of OS 1 the next time it
is scheduled so there's a penalty
associated with exceeding the time
quantum the time quantum is bound during
this time quantum OS 1 has complete
control of the processor and exokernel
is not going to get in the middle of it
unless a process that is running on
behalf of OS 1 incurs a page fault in
that case exokernel has to come in the
middle in order to feel that page fault
and pass it up to the operating system
and otherwise during this time quantum
the operating system is entirely at
liberty to use the processor for running
whatever processes it wants to at the
end of the time quantum the timer
interrupt goes off exokernel feels it
and kicks it up to this operating system
and tells the operating system to clean
up its act save any context at once so
that the CPU can be reallocated to the
next library operating system and that's
where the time is bounded as to how much
time the library operating system can
take in order to do that saving of the
context</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
