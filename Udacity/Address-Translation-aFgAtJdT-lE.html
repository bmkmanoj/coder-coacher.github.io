abstraction is a layer of indirection
without this layer of indirection two
processes couldn't use the same address
for a variable because then they would
end up overriding each other this would
make life very difficult for programmers
and compilers so we play one of the
classic computer science tricks and
introduce a layer of indirection inside
the operating system each process has
something called a page table that acts
like a phone directory or a dictionary
giving for each virtual address the
physical address that it corresponds to
usually this will be a place in memory
but when space and main memory is low it
might also be part of the disk called
swap in many systems and when a program
is first starting up we usually don't
load the whole application into memory
first thing but rather leave part of the
program that might not always be needed
on the disk this indirection allows us
to accomplish several things first it
allows us to have an address space that
is bigger than physical main memory this
is convenient when main memory itself
isn't big enough and we need to use the
disk or when we want to map other
storage devices and treat them like
memory second it provides protection
between processes as mentioned earlier
without indirection the applications
might find themselves overriding each
other's data with the operating system
properly managing the page tables
however these two virtual addresses can
be pointed to different physical
addresses thirdly it can allow for
sharing even different virtual addresses
can be made to refer to the same
physical address again just by properly
maintaining the page tables lastly I
should point out that because kernel
addresses are the same for each process
they get their own page table that is
shared among the processes this is
called the global page table</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
