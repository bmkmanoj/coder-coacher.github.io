machine it accepts both one or more
letters like word wor d and also one or
more digits one two three in fact
there's a sense in which it accepts
either A through Z plus or 0 through 9
plus note it's to accepting states such
power can we do the same thing with
regular expressions it turns out we can
with a new regular expression operator a
new bit of syntax and regular
expressions that I'm going to teach you
this vertical bar means I match either
the thing on the left or the thing on
the right it's formerly called
disjunction sometimes but we can just
read it as or match a through z plus or
0 through 9 plus for example let's say
we want to find all matches of lowercase
a through z plus or 0 through 9 plus in
gathi 1749 will get both eartha in 1749
we don't get the capital G because we
asked for lower case letters over here
one of growth as most famous works is
Faust in which an old man makes a
literal deal with the devil in an
incredible surprise move it does not go
particularly well and in fact the phrase
Faustian bargain has entered the modern
English lexicon meaning a deal that you
really don't want to make or where
you're giving up too much to get
something while we're here our old
friend regular expression 0 through two
is really just 012 so i could write out
a through z as 26 different choices but
that's not very concise</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
