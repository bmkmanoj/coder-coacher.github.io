ops were not talking with each other
early in the development process ending
up with incompatible environments is a
pretty bad result from that suppose the
dev knew what ops knows that the
production system has to all work
together as an integrated unit that can
be tested and scaled it can't be patched
together from pieces the last minute
before launch and suppose that ops knew
who had ever knows that the system under
development needs to change rapidly the
technology is involved just aren't going
to be the same forever with that kind of
shared knowledge dev and ops could work
together to come up with a common
deployment environment that would work
well both in development and in
production that would deploy well onto
servers at scale how also letting
developers make all of the changes that
they need to build new features this is
just one example of how technical change
can be made in response to the social
and organizational challenges of DevOps
there are different ways to implement
this particular change but first let's
take a look at the situation in which
this problem arises</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
