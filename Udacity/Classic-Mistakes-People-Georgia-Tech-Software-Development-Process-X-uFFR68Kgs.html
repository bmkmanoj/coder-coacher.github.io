lesson and in this part I want to talk
about well-known ineffective development
practices these practices when followed
tend to lead to predictably bad results
so let's look at some examples of these
classic mistakes and we're gonna start
with mistakes involving people and
notice that there is a long list so I'm
going to discuss just a few of those
mistakes and I'm gonna point you to more
information on this topic in the class
notes and some of these mistakes are
actually kind of entertaining so I'll
recommend that you look at the class
notes and going more depth in this list
so the first people mistake I wanna
mention is the one that I define heroics
and this refers to too much emphasis on
can-do attitudes so this idea that one
person by themself or by yourself can do
everything and can make the difference
in the whole project and unfortunately
this encourages extreme risk-taking and
discourages cooperation which is plain
bad for the project for example in my
force people not to report schedule
slips he might force people to take on
too much responsibility and normally and
I saw it happen many times the final
result is failure so what you want when
you're developing a larger project is
actually to apply it soft and
engineering principles have teams of
teamwork and have cooperation among the
different team members without pointing
too much on single individuals another
classic mistake is not to create the
right working environment we all like to
work in nice environments and there is
strong evidence that the working
environments can play a big role in
productivity there is evidence that
productivity increases when the
workplace is nice quiet warm and
welcoming finally some of the most
important people related mistakes are
due to poor people management for
example lack of leadership or leadership
that is exercised that using the wrong
means in the wrong way which can lead to
very unhappy personal and therefore low
productivity or even people leaving
teams another classic example of poor
management is adding people to a project
that is behind schedule which never
works
why doesn't work because these new
people need to be brought up to speed
and that causes further delays rather
than improving the situation with the
project schedule</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
