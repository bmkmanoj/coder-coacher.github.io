matrix vector multiply example it's not
safe to make the innermost loop a par
for loop first observe that all
iterations J write to the same location
Y sub I this situation is called a data
race so more precisely a data race is at
least one read and at least one write
that can happen at the same memory
location at the same time so let's take
two iterations J just as an example
let's assume that I is equal to 1 and
let's look at J equals 5 and J equals
100 and furthermore suppose that Y sub 1
has the initial value of 0 now suppose I
start executing the two statements
simultaneously and let's say I evaluate
this multiplication and this
multiplication at the same time as well
it may be hypothetically I get the
values 72 and minus 100 now suppose I
simultaneously read Y sub 1 then both
statements will get the value 0 when
they read Y sub 1 now suppose that J
equals 5 executes its write first then Y
sub 1 will get the value of 72 but in
the meantime that J equals 100 statement
is operating with the stale value of y
so when we do this sum we'll get minus
100 and when we do the write will
overwrite the value of 72 instead of
accumulating it this is clearly an error
now data race that leads to an error is
called a race condition so when you're
designing parallel algorithms you need
to be careful to avoid race conditions
as a heuristic it's often helpful to
avoid data races as well but an
important point is that a data race does
not always lead to a race condition
you'll see some examples of that
throughout the course</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
