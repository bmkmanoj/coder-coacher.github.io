general method people use principal
components all the time and the face
recognition method is just what we use
to introduce it although I will say it's
become very well known because not just
because that well it worked and caught
sort of caught people by surprise but
just it had this very clean
interpretation in fact now people you'll
hear instead of eigenfaces you'll hear
about I ghen gates right so you you take
measurements of people walking you try
to find a principal component analysis
project them down and do it there Rin
body shapes which is terrifying to think
about but basically the idea if I've you
know people vary in different shapes and
I should be able to take a small number
of variations and say I can fit you buy
just a small number of control knobs if
you're doing computer graphics animation
and you want to be able to control
different shapes of people to build
different characters you want to be able
to just turn a small number of knobs and
have people change their overall build
their height things like that and you
can use this principle component
analysis or more sophisticated versions
of it to do that the method that I've
shown you here also is a linear method
right all these things are orthogonal
and I can compute the coefficients by
just taking the dot product and that's a
nice property to have it makes things
easy to do but it's also a liability if
I have a just say a three-dimensional
space suppose I have points that
actually just lie along a curve ok so
they're all on a single curve which
means if you just told me the value
along that curve that would represent
the point completely assuming I knew the
curve but it's not a line it's a curve
ok so it bends so there are non linear
methods of doing principal component
analysis that allow you to capture sort
of nonlinear lower dimensional manifold
we won't talk about it here but in fact
that there's ones called nonlinear
colonel pca but for now all you need to
know about is what we talked about here
linear orthogonal decomposition of
principal components</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
