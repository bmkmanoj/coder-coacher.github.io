introduce a few additional coverage
criteria using a slightly more complex
example but still a pretty simple one
final showing here is a program that
reads two real numbers x and y and then
if X is equal to zero or Y is greater
than zero it computes Y as Y divided by
X otherwise it computes X as y plus 2
then you write the value of x the value
of y and it terminates
let's also introduce a CFG for that
program as you can see the CFG
represents the statements in the code
and the control flow and in this case I
made explicit over the branches what are
the conditions under which those
branches are taken to make it simpler to
look at the example let's assume that we
have two tests for this code that are
shown here for the first one the inputs
are 5 and 5 for the second one 5 and
minus 5 if we consider branch coverage
for this code and we consider the two
test cases for the first one this
condition is true because X is it not
equal to 0 but Y is greater than 0 and
therefore we will follow this true
branch for the second one the condition
is false because X is not equal to 0 and
Y is not greater than 0 therefore the
negation of it is true and we will
follow this branch in other words these
two test cases achieve 100% branch
coverage on this code if we look at the
code though we can see that there is the
possibility of making this code fail
consider this statement if X is equal to
0 we could have division by 0 however
these two test cases despite the fact
that they achieve 100% branch coverage
will not rebuild this problem so how can
we be more follow I'll let you think
about it for a second so think about how
can we test more thoroughly in a more
complete way this code so in a way that
goes beyond branch coverage and the
answer is that we can make each
condition true and false instead of just
considering the whole predicate here and
that's exactly what is required by the
next criteria that we're going to
consider which is condition coverage
we're going to define it as usual in
terms of test requirements and coverage
measure in this case the test
requirements for condition coverage are
the individual conditions in the program
so we want each condition in the program
to be both true and false for some
execution so the way in which we can
measure that is by measuring the number
of conditions that were both true and
false when we execute our tests over the
total number of conditions and that
gives us the
edge of coverage that we achieved for
condition coverage again if you want to
look at this criteria in the form of a
question the question will be has each
boolean sub expression which means every
condition in every predicate evaluated
both to true and false when we run our
tests</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
