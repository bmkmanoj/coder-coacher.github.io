the pseudocode that we have for mimic
and see if we can plug in some of the
stuff that we we just talked about just
as a way of refreshing so as you recall
the goal is to generate samples from
some pea soup theta sub T of X so in
this case we're just going to estimate
that by finding the best dependency tree
we can that is the best PI function okay
so we're going to be starting with some
dependency tree and we're going to
generate sample from that and we know
how to generate samples from that given
a dependency tree like say this we
simply start at a node generate
according to its unconditional
distribution and then generate samples
from each according to its conditional
distribution convinced parent so first
we generate a sample from here then we
generate one from here then from here
then from here and then from here now
where do we get these conditional
probability tables Michael that's a good
question I think it's pretty direct from
the mutual information exactly in order
to compute the mutual information that
is in order to compute the entropies we
have to know the probabilities so we
generate all of these samples and that
tells us now for every single feature X
of I how often that was say taking on a
value of 1 or taking on a value for 0 if
we assume everything's binary so that
means we have unconditional probability
distributions or at least estimates of
unconditional property distributions for
every single one of our features yes yep
and at the same time because we have
these samples we know for every pair of
features the probability that one took
on a value given a value for the other
so we already have the conditional
probability tables for each of those as
well so just the act of generating these
samples and building that mutual
information graph gives us all the
conditional and unconditional
probability tables that we need and so
given that we can generate samples and
time linear in the number of features
and we're done so this part is easy by
the way you asked me a question before I
just want to make it clear that we come
back with an undirected graph and you
can pick any single node as the root and
that will induce a specific directed
tree and it actually just follows from
the chain rule I'll leave that as an
exercise to the viewer but there you go
so now we know how to generate samples
from some tree that we have we generate
a bunch of these samples
we find the best once retaining only
those samples and now we know how to
estimate the next one by simply doing
the maximum spanning tree overall the
mutual information and then we just
repeat and we keep doing that and there
you go a particular version of mimic
with dependency trees got it cool right
so again just to really drive this point
home you don't have to use dependency
trees you can use unconditional
probability distributions which are also
very easy to sample from and very easy
to estimate you could come up with more
complicated things if you wanted to try
to find the best Bayesian network you
can do all of these other kinds of
things and that'll work just fine
dependency trees though are very
powerful because they do allow you to
capture these relationships that is to
say they give you a probability
distribution that has structure that we
were looking for while not having to pay
an exponential cost for doing the
estimation</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
