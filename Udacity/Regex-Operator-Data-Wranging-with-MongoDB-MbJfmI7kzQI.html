valued fields using the greater than and
less than operators returning to our
consideration of queries matching string
fields there are more complicated sorts
of queries that you might want to
perform on strings than just equality
and inequality for example we often want
to look for patterns and strings MongoDB
supports querying for string patterns
using the regex operator regex is based
on a regular expression library in
particular the perl compatible regular
expression library for more information
i'd encourage you to just google for
this so the regex operator allows us to
do regular expression queries in MongoDB
let's look at some examples now in this
collection city documents contain a
model field or at least some of them do
so as an example of doing regex queries
in MongoDB let's take a look at some of
the words these mottos contain this is a
very simple regular expression in fact
we don't even need reg X to do this one
so if I do the query this way I should
match only documents where friendship is
the entire string of the motto and here
we go friendship okay so now let's begin
to expand this regular expression what
I'm going to do first is introduce a
very simple change now we're looking for
all mottos that contain the word
friendship and friendship can be either
capitalized or not and so here we have
four where before we simply had one
document okay so now let's expand this a
little bit more and if you're regex
skills are a little rusty please see the
instructor notes for documentation and
pointers to some tutorials so let's
expand this to include another word okay
so this regular expression will identify
all documents containing a motto with
either the word friendship or the word
pride and either word can be capitalized
let's take a look at the actual models
themselves and again I'm going to use a
projection to make it a little bit
easier to see the mottos okay and we can
see that each one of these has either
the word pride or the word friendship in
it and capitalization doesn't matter
okay so that's about all the farther I
want to go with regex queries in this
example
point here is that MongoDB supports Pro
compatible regular expressions so you
have a lot of power and what types of
queries you can do involving string
valued fields</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
