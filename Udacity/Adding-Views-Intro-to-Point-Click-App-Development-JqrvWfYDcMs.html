dashboard thing you've got our nice
pretty visualize data awesome I suspect
that there is a way in Salesforce to
kind of get this functionality you know
filtering data things like that but in
the app itself and like I could imagine
maybe there's someone at the festival
whose whose job is to organize the
electronic music bands or the bossa nova
bands for you and that person might want
to just look at bands of a specific
genre yeah is there a way to filter data
like that yeah so that's actually a
pretty easy functionality to create
let's take a look here so what we're
looking at right now is a list view of
just the recent bands that's what comes
up by default and if you click that Go
button it's going to take us to the all
list view so that's showing us all the
bands completely but like you saw from a
little pick list the only option we have
is all so in order to create a view to
sort by genre we'd have to create a new
view so click that create a new view
link and so this is going to create a
list view of any filter that we define
actually we can do it bossa nova bands
that's a small list so filtered by owner
I'll bands we want all bands and then we
want to choose that genre field and then
equals whatever and so you can make
these pretty complicated with filters on
like dates and like this date but also
this name and this genre and get really
specific like if we have multiple
festivals it could even be genres but
only at a certain festival okay and so
I'm going to let's say in a show the
band name and I'm going to show the
manager phone number and maybe I want to
know their twitter handle so I can tweet
them and all my PR stuff yeah as I like
invisible to all users it's safe anyway
it is said there are only three bossa
nova bad sir this managers does not have
a lot of work to do but that's okay so I
really like where we're going with this
you know you can really visualize our
data and get a feel of what it would be
like to use the app
the day of yeah so I want to think more
about that because I mean having this
visualization is nice but it's actually
it's not that clear to me what I would
actually be doing on the actual day of
the festival right and you know we
haven't completely added functionality
into it yet even right now it's just
static data and it's showing us
information but it's a little bit of
calculation based off the formulas that
we've made but we haven't added too much
human interaction pieces to it you know
that actually streamline processes okay
so can we do that yeah let's do that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
