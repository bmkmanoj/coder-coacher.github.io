looking to create what's great about
this view is that it uses mostly UI
elements we've seen before in order to
prevent the number of complex layouts
from growing explosively we're going to
take advantage of three Android layout
features the first one we've seen before
the only difference between a forecast
list item on the phone and on the tablet
is padding in margins around the list
items fortunately it's easy to add this
to the forecast list we can use
dimensions to give the same layout more
space in tablet layouts in forecast list
item layout we can add a padding
dimension to the outer layout we use
padding here instead of margin because
we just want the contents inset if we
used margin the rows selector wouldn't
be drawn across the entire list item we
also use a different dimension for the
space between the two temperatures note
that we use both right and then to make
sure this layout is ready for
right-to-left mirroring so then in our
resources file we create a dimension
that updates the extra padding and the
space between the two temperatures and
that layout is updated i'm using SW 600d
p dash port which means that these
changes will only be applied on portrait
orientation with devices then if two
sides with at least a width of 600 DP
the second thing we take advantage of
his layout reuse using the include tag
we can see that our portrait and
landscape detail fragment use the same
views the fragment detail view contains
these included layouts already note that
we can assign new layout parameters when
we include the layout we're not using
this in sunshine but we can avoid adding
an extra container when we include the
layout by using the merge tag in the
layout to be included finally we're
going to continue to make use of refs
rest allow us to make aliases for
resources as you can see in tablet
landscape mode the detail view should
point to a vertical version of the view
we're going to create a ref that points
to fragment details start and make sure
that it points the correct detail
fragment for all configurations this
will come in handy the next lecture</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
