problem of you know how do you evaluate
the level of security that comes with
the system no one more concern about
this then for example the Defense
Department they have a lot of sensitive
data so they actually address this
problem of how do you do security
evaluation how do you stablish how
trustworthy or level of assurance level
of trust that you can associate with a
given system and they actually came up
with a trusted computer system
evaluation criteria this is work that
goes back to actually the eighties and
this is called the orange book or thisi
sac requirements trusted computer
systems evaluation criteria what you see
here is actually it doesn't show the
color actually it is orange copy the
cover page of that report one of the
people who are involved is designing
that Roger shell who signed it and my
copy so I just provided you a picture of
that so the question is if you are sort
of tasked with this develop a is set of
evaluation criteria that we can use to
assess the trustworthiness or security
of a system what would be those criteria
I think some of the discussions we have
had for example about functionality and
how well it's done and so on should
actually factor into these requirements
that that we're going to have so the
orange book that I mentioned sort of
captured the evaluation criteria and
came up with so the way to place a
system in a division and within a
division a certain class so the four
divisions were d c b and a the less than
he really refers to the least
trustworthy and we'll see why he was the
less trustworthy and a was the highest
level of trust and within that for
example we Division C had C 1 and C 2 so
C one doesn't do certain things that C 2
does for it to be more trustworthy okay
so this ordering that we have is going
from least trustworthy to the highest
level of trust b1 b2 b3 means three
classes within the division B well D
really didn't have to do anything
if you didn't do think about your old
ms-dos if I didn't isolate the trusted
computing base from untrusted code
basically untrusted code could hook
operating system functions in whatever
way there's no protection against
tampering bypassing it and things like
that
Davidson see one of the things it has to
do is do authentication and access
control okay access control it only has
to do discretionary access control but
of course to do access control it also
has to do authentication and if it does
that then it addresses a bunch of other
things I'm just sort of giving you quick
highlights here but of course you know
TCP isolation and stuff like that has to
be here too so that places you in in
division see if you implemented
mandatory access control for example BLP
like model where that'll move you up to
the division b and you could verify use
formal verification techniques
specification or verification if you
went that far then that's what will be
needed for you to get into division a
most systems that we use that the
security features that they provide
commercial systems that are widely
deployed they're basically in the C
division and C 1 C 2 or whether they
move up to to get B 1 of course they had
to do mandatory access control so we
said as the Linux for example does
implement Mac so C 1 and C 2 actually
depends on what functionality so here is
sort of shouldn't be confused by the
fact that this we're talking about
functionality with discretionary and
mandatory access control this is
actually how well isn't it verified so
what effort you put into making sure
that there are no problems so it's how
well you you know code reviews you do
you testing pen testing based on all
these you know D how auditing support
and audit logs and things like that you
will have different classes but the main
idea here is that most systems that we
use widely these days they're basically
division see some implement Mac features
and
they get into this division B that v1
that I have if you want to move up to B
to for example what you may have to do
is you have to whatever security model
that your system is you know underlies
your system you have to have a proof of
correctness for that model or you also
have to have a spec for the TCB it
doesn't have to be formally done but you
have to have a narrative specification
of the TCB and what it does of course if
you want to move up to b3 or evan we
said that's formal verification that you
have to do and I mean that the TCB is
implemented correctly and things like
that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
