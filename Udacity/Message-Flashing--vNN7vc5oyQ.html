incorporate feedback throughout the user
experience if a user doesn't get enough
feedback they'll probably end up hating
the application we should add a feature
that explicitly notifies the user that
the system has responded to their input
Flass provides a really simple way to
give feedback to a user message flashing
is a feature that will prompt a message
to a user immediately after a certain
action has taken place and then
disappear the next time the page is
requested we can use our templates to
reveal a flash message wherever and
however we want from within the
application to get started let's import
Flash from our flask module flashing
works in flask by using a concept called
sessions this course doesn't go to in
depth with sessions but just know that
sessions are way a server can store
information across multiple web pages to
create a more personalized user
experience in the bottom of our project
pie file let's first add a secret key
which flask will use to create sessions
for our users normally this should be a
very secure password if our application
was live on the Internet
but for development purposes let's just
set our key to super secret key to flash
a message within our application we
simply use the flash function like this
to get a hold of all of the flash
messages we can use get underscore flash
underscore messages which will also work
from within our templates so from within
my new menu item method I will create a
flash message right after I call session
commit I will add the message new menu
item created within the parenthesis now
in my new menu item HTML template I will
add the following code if you're not
familiar with this with construct in
Python don't worry it's just a block
that does some automatic cleanup when
the block is exited that we don't really
have to concern ourselves with if you're
curious about the width method in Python
I will provide some resources in the
instructor notes the get flash messages
is returning an array of messages that
is gonna get stored in this variable
called messages we then loop through the
array of messages if it's non-empty and
print it out to our HTML document inside
an unordered list now when I save my
code and try making a new item
I'm flash with a confirmation message on
my main menu screen</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
