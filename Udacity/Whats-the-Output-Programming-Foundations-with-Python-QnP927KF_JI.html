and now I will start the define class
child now I know class child inherits
from class parent and the way to
indicate that in Python is to say this
the syntax here means that class child
will now inherit or reuse everything
that is publicly available in class
parent now things will get really
interesting when we begin to define the
init method or the constructor for this
class so we know that class child has
three variables last name and eye color
that are inherited from class parent and
this other variable called number of
toys so in addition to the keyword self
I will receive those values as arguments
right here in the init function where
they are now to initialize the variables
I am inheriting from class parent
variables like last name and eye color
I will actually reuse class parents init
method this is how to do it
the last instance variable number of
toys will be initialized next okay
finally I will add a print statement to
the very beginning of the init method
alright now that we have defined our
class child the next thing to do is to
create an instance of this class child I
will call it appropriately enough Miley
Cyrus and here I will provide it the
three necessary arguments and then I
will print out two things her last name
and the number of toys also so I can
focus on these print statements in my
output I will comment out the previous
instance for now there let me save this
file now before I run this program I
want you to think about what the output
of this program will be so here is the
code one more time here is class parent
and here is class child and here we are
creating an instance of class child and
we named it Miley Cyrus so what do you
think will be printed when I run this
piece of code enter your responses in
this box</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
