engaging well we can usually look at how
popular the game is by finding out if
the game is downloaded a lot and if the
reviews are good for example here we can
see game apps in the amazon appstore and
we can see the number of reviews in the
star rating from one to five stars and
this gives us a good idea of how
engaging our game is if the game has a
Radian close to five stars it's probably
pretty fun and if it's lower then maybe
there's something the users don't like
about it we can also look at how long
and how often players use our game and
measure engagement here are some terms
we use to measure it session count
session length and retention session
count is the number of times an app is
launched so anytime a player opens the
app whether that's once a week or ten
times a day the session count goes up
and if we look at the average session
counts for a player over a day we can
get a pretty good idea of how addicting
our game is but some games are designed
for longer sessions instead of multiple
short sessions so the session length is
also important session length is the
amount of time that the app is in use
for a particular session so whether
that's a few minutes or going on and on
two lengths of hours and again for this
to be a useful metric we would usually
look at the average the average session
length across users to see how long a
typical user plays once they open the
app and we also look at retention which
is a measure of how many users continue
to play your game as time goes on
usually game retention is measured a day
after your game is first launched and
downloaded a week after and the month
after just to see how many of your
original players you keep over time say
you want to measure retention over a
week for the game Fruit Ninja that means
you want to see how many people who
start at the beginning of the week are
still around at the end of the week
during the week some of these early
users will leave fruit ninja and new
owns will
but we don't want to take into account
the new ones we just want to see who
started at the beginning of the week and
stayed throughout the whole week to
calculate this you need to look at the
users at the end of the week minus any
of the newcomers who joined in the
middle of the week all divided by the
number of users that started at the
beginning of the week then multiply all
this by 100 to get a percentage and this
is going to be your attention for the
week so let's look at some numbers for
fruit ninja let's say we had 400 people
download the game at the start of the
week and there's 700 total by the end of
the week that looks pretty good but we
also know that 500 of these people are
new they joined in the middle of the
week and they aren't part of our 400
original starting players so let's
calculate the retention first we have
700 from the end of the week minus the
500 new players that join midweek so our
only accounting for our original 400 to
see who stuck around all divided by our
400 original players then x 100 to get a
percentage this is going to be 200 over
400 or half times one hundred percent
which is going to give us fifty percent
retention over this week which is pretty
good ideally we'd want a hundred percent
retention which means everyone who
downloads your game keeps playing it and
never quits but no game has perfect
retention and even really great games
have around fifty percent retention
after just the first day that means that
half the players leave during the first
24 hours of playing this seems like a
lot of people leaving but it's
considered pretty good retention
especially if your game is good at
getting new players over time it won't
matter that a lot of older ones leave
lots of developers use a 40 2010 rule as
a guideline for good retention over a
day a week and a month so after a game
is downloaded by a bunch of people we
have a hundred percent of people forty
percent of those users stick around
after the first day twenty percent of
those stay for a week
and only ten percent stay for a whole
month and even longer usually if you
have retention at these time points a
day a week or a month that's higher
that's great if it's any lower that's
considered bad retention</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
