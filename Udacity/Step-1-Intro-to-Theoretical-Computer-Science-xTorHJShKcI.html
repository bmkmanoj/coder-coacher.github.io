tour can be stated as a decision problem
we still need to show that that problem
is in NP and for shortest tour this is
well it's not really that difficult but
it's actually a little bit of a hassle
so let's do another quiz here why is
shortest tour in NP so basically the
question is if we have non determinism
why can short this tour then be solved
in polynomial time is it because we can
use non determinism to guess which
vertices to put into the shortest tour
is it because once a shortest tour has
been guessed using non determinism the
length of that torque can be checked in
polynomial time is it because non
determinism can guess a shortest tour
and by that I mean that we can use the
if-better function to guess the tour
here so you would have something like
this if better visit vertex a else visit
another vertex next or do we even have
to show this because actually it's quite
obvious so more than one can be correct
and please tell me which ones are</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
