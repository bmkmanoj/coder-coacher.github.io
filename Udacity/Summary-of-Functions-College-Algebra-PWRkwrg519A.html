function Maps each element of its domain
to exactly one element of its range and
a function also can be seen as a
relation between a set of inputs and set
of outputs however none of the other
three choices are true let's look at the
first one if we had checked this one off
we will be arguing that a function Maps
each element of the domain to at least
one element of the range now think back
to that soda machine example the soda
machine operated like a function because
for any amount of money you put in
there's only one option for the amount
of soda that you could get out functions
work like beautiful machines in the same
way they're deterministic a single input
can only lead to one single output so
the second one must be right instead of
the first one now we know that this last
choice isn't true because there are some
equations with two variables that aren't
functions and we haven't delved super
deep into this but you already know that
there has to be a special relationship
between those two variables namely this
one that the independent variable can
only map-21 value of the dependent
variable and not all equations the two
variables do that for example we might
have x equals y squared which is a
horizontal parabola or we might have x
squared plus y squared equals 4 which
gives us a circle neither of these pass
the vertical line test which we talked
about before so they're not functions
and they don't pass the vertical line
test because they don't meet this
criterion and finally if we said that
functions must have a defined value for
any real numbers input then we will be
seeing that the domain of every single
function has to be all the real numbers
and that's just not the case we talked
about two different major types of
domain restrictions that prevent certain
real numbers from being within the
domains of certain functions will talk
about even more of these cases later on
you just have to wait a couple of weeks
or some really really exciting stuff I
know the past couple of lessons have
required a pretty major paradigm shift
in terms of the way that we think about
the relationship with variables to one
another and what equations really are
but I hope that you found our work with
functions interesting and I think that
will prove more and more helpful as we
continue to use the function paradigm in
our problem solving especially in our
setting up of equations great job</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
