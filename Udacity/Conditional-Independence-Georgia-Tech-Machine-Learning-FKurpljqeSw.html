definition first hit me so conditional
independence is this idea that goes like
this we're gonna say that some variable
that makes up the Joint Distribution is
conditionally independent of some other
variable Y given Z if it's the case that
the probability distribution governing
ax so the probabilities associated with
the values in this variable X is
independent of the value of Y given the
value of Z if I tell you what Z is then
you can figure out what the probability
of x is without having to look at Y so
that is if it's the case that for all
possible values little X little Y and
little Z for the variables big X big Y
and B Z if it's the case that the
probability that big X the random
variable big X takes on the value little
X given that Big Y takes on the value
little Y and Big Z takes on the value
little Z equals the probability that big
X takes on a value x given Big Z takes
on the value of Z if those are equal for
all possible ways of filling in the
values of the variables then we say that
X is conditionally independent of Y
given Z right so you see we dropped Y
from the right-hand side of the
probability expression ok so it's sort
of less things that we have to worry
about if it's the case that we really
didn't need it in the first place if you
were fair enough so that's pretty
similar to normal independence
okay so what's normal independence so
normal independence you say the
probability of x and y is equal to the
probability of x times the probability
of Y that's right which means if we
think about the chain rule we also know
that the probability of X and y is equal
to the probability of X given Y times
the probability of Y so that means that
the probability of x given Y is equal to
the probability of X for all values of x
and y so this is actually implying
so then probably if it equals that oh
that means that px x py equals px given
Y times P Y we cancel those we get PX
equals
ok so that's what you wanted to say
right so it since what independence
means right is that the Joint
Distribution between two variables is
equal to the product of their marginal
that's just you know comes from basic
probability theory and so if you think
about what that means from the chain
rule point of view it's like saying the
probability of X given Y
is equal to the probability of X so it
looks just like the equation you wrote
down for conditional independence right
the only thing that we added is this
notion that it might be the case that we
don't have such a strong property as
this where it's always the case that you
can write the probability of X given Y
just with the probability of X but in
the context of some of knowing some
value Z it might be true and that's what
conditional independence gives us as
long as there is some Z that we can
stick in here that gives us that
property that's great we can essentially
ignore Y when we're talking about the
probability of X ok that's pretty cool
that seems more powerful or something
yeah and in fact remember you mentioned
the word factoring you can see here that
we're writing down a probability as the
product of two other things we're
factoring that probability distribution
that's what independence lists let's do
and conditional independence lets us do
it in in more general circumstances so
let's apply this concept back to what we
were just talking about before ok</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
