doing it looks like when we submit the
first time we lock the record yep so
nobody else can play with it no one else
can modify it until it's either Brandon
fully approved or rejected make sense
okay and we can do looks like we can add
other actions there right okay so let's
think about this what are we going to
want to do here okay so in this case
when a new set time is created and you
know we've added a band and a stage we
probably want to change the field once
it's been set into in review set the
status of it from New to in review okay
so let's do it yeah field update change
status to in review is that okay yep and
the field to update status very cool so
specify a new field value in review and
then safe okay that makes sense so now
that we have it changing that status
field it'll notify everyone hey this is
why the records locked it's in review
the next piece would be waiting for
whoever was approving it to actually say
they will approve it or not and train so
there's going to be a related lists on
the record where they can do it from
there like straight from the records of
a manager could the manager could
approve yes or no okay or if we had that
email template setup they could also
approve ya from the union yes cool okay
an approval step so this is just
somebody saying this is the part of the
process where somebody says looks good
yeah so this is talking to whoever needs
to approve it and see how it says step
one you could add a bunch of approvers
if you really wanted to okay but we
don't so now we can do final approval
elections right all right um so it looks
like by default it locks the record yep
and we want to I guess change the status
again to confirmed yeah sounds good all
right we did that okay and then we have
rejection actions and recall actions
would sound similar to me but I guess
there's a distinction so I would say I
mean we'd probably want to keep using
that status field to delineate we're in
the process it is yeah with final
rejection I would say that would
probably be canceled because we're like
no we don't want the sunny
more but recall maybe we send it back to
New that makes sense okay all right
we've got our actions all figured out
based on what the approval says yep so
what should we do next test it out
sounds good</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
