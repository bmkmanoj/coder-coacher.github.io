resource it tells us user ID what access
that user has and the next user ID what
access that user has and some number of
entries like that and by the way access
control entries or aces is what they're
called so what should a cultura nob ject
Oh be stored so first of all this has to
be stored in the trusted part of the
system it has to be stored in the
operating system with the trusted
computing base because it actually
determines who can access a resource
that needs to be protected if it's not
in the trusted part then some untrusted
code or application potentially can
change it but very exactly does it go in
that system so we know that it is a list
of these access control entries and this
is for a given object or a resource such
a list this an ACL exists for each
resource so we have resource R is going
to have an ACL R one natural place for
us to store this ACL is where other
information about the resource or the
object is stored so the other
information typically what we call is
metadata about that resource so if the
resource was a file for example metadata
might say the size of the file where on
disk it may be stored who the owner is
and things like that we can store the
ACL along with that other metadata that
you have so we're gonna do an example
for Linux like system of UNIX systems
how file system access control is
implemented and we're going to see that
ACL information actually gets stored
same place where metadata about a file
is stored in the operating system we
said Merida has one some other
information where ACL is going to be
stored as well so then the question is
how do we use this information so
remember for an object resource if
somebody is going to use it the object
or resource has to be activated so it's
ready for use the metadata has to be
acquired something has to be set up in
the operating system and once that is
done then the request is going to come
so at that time we have to perform a
check access control check to decide if
the request should be granted so how do
we perform
that access control check let's say it's
coming from alice the request source is
we know is Alice's UID and the request
is for vial foo we're going to go to the
metadata for file foo where we also
going to find Akal for file foo and once
we have that Akal we basically have to
traverse it looking for an access
control entry for Alice and then see if
the access rights in that ace grant
permission to this object to Alice in
the manners or what kind of request is
being made so for example it's read of a
file and as the read access write exist
in the ACL or the ace that we have in
the ACL for user Alice so traversal
basically says when a request comes from
a given user we have to go down the list
to see if an S exists for the source of
the request and if it does does it
include permissions consistent with the
nature of the request and if that's the
case then we can grant access if we
can't find such an ace or the access
right doesn't exist so there is an
access ace that says you can read what
the request is for right then also we're
going to deny it so now we understand
how ACLs can be used</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
