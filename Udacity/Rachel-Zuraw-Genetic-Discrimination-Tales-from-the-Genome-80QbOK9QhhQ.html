normally site and say this is scary we
need to do something about this this is
a moral imperative what is what is
behind that aside from the movie gattaca
which i think is behind a lot of it it's
very scary movie it is you seen it
lately gina was conceived of and passed
because people people are very concerned
that opportunities will be for stalled
based on a possibility of some genetic
issue that could befall them later on in
life that they're being you know
prejudged pre penalized based on
something that might not happen so Gina
or the Genetic Information
non-discrimination Act was passed in
1995 and what did it do gina was
actually signed into law in 2008 it was
a very long process so it the fight to
create Gina first began in 1995 you know
a bunch of the bills that eventually
became Gina started circulating through
the government back in 95 and probably
being talked of even earlier well Gina's
general goal is to prevent
discrimination by employers with 15 or
more employees or by insurers based on
an individual's genetic information or
family medical history so they included
family medical history in part because
you know not everyone has had their
genome sequenced but the idea is there
are a lot of this breaks down into a lot
of different provisions of course a lot
of different individual granular
protections that the insurer cannot
raise premiums based on the fact that
say my aunt had breast cancer I may or
may not carry one of the Baraka gene
variants that would increase my likely
risk of receiving breast cancer I cannot
be charged under Gina a higher premium
for that likewise
your insurer or your employer cannot
require that you undergo any type of
genetic testing to assess your risk for
developing any condition your it permits
of course in health a health care
provider to recommend genetic testing
for various purposes but even then an
insurer or an employer can only collect
the bare minimum of information that
they need to have for coverage decisions
basically they cannot collect and store
additional information regarding your
genetic makeup predispositions do you
feel the concern about genetic
discrimination is valid absolutely I
mean you can all too easily imagine an
employer you know saying you know let's
let's not say breast cancer let's say
someone has a you know they've had their
genome they've had their genome coded
and they show a likelihood it shows that
you know they will almost certainly
develop Huntington's say and an employer
who wants to make a long-term investment
an employee if they have access to that
information they're allowed to make
decisions based on it might say you know
we'd really rather have some what will
have a longer working life with us
likewise and ensure i mean insurers make
their money based on having the maximum
number of basically healthy people
paying into the insurance pool which
then right goes to pay for the less
healthy people it is in the insurer's
best interest to keep as many people who
are going to develop serious conditions
out of that pool as possible so yeah I
think that's a completely rational
concern that people have that led to
Gina I think it's one of the few
occasions when as you said they sort of
got out ahead of the possibility of
experiencing this type of discrimination</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
