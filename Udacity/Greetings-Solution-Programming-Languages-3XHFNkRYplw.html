remember the rules for function calls
you take the function body and you
evaluate it in the new argument so the
body of say hello is print greeting plus
person and we already know from seeing
it in the interpreter what it's going to
print out it's going to print out hello
from you p Gracie currently I don't see
Gracie anywhere in this environment that
suggests that we are definitely going to
need to add it another way to get to
that is to remember the other rules for
constructing environments we definitely
want to make space for the formal
parameters person and put in the value
of the actual argument Gracie so now
when we go to evaluate greeting we don't
see it here but we'll go one up and get
hello from you p and we'll try to find
person we see it right here we get
Gracie will compose them together and
print out exactly the same behavior we
saw in the interpreter this quiz was
pretty tricky this notion of nested
procedures does not come up very often
in Python but if we want a complete
interpreter one that understands all the
nuances of a language then we have to
handle this it's kind of like the
subjunctive in a lot of romance
languages doesn't come up very often in
English may come up more often than
you'd think in other places</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
