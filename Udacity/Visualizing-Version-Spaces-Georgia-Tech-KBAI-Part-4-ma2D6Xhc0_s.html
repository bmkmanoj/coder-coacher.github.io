difference between the incremental
concept learning we've talked about in
the past and version spaces in terms of
a bit of a visualization we can imagine
a spectrum that runs from a very
specific model of a concept to a very
general model of a concept and we can
imagine that this circle represents
where our model currently is if we
receive a new positive example that's
not currently subsumed by our concept
we're going to generalize it a bit to
move it to the right if we receive a
negative example that is currently
included in our concept we're going to
move it to the left and specialize as
more and more examples come in we start
to see that our concept keeps moving
around until eventually it lands
somewhere that might represent a good
model of that concept so right here
we've landed on a model right here it's
on the more specific end of the spectrum
so based on our examples we decide that
this is actually a pretty narrowly
applicable concept the general visual
here though is that we had ones concept
they were moving back and forth along
the spectrum from specific to general
based on our new examples with version
spaces though what we do is we start
with both a specific model and a general
model so we take our dog example if
we've only ever encountered one dog we
might have a very specific model that
says that any black four-legged furry
animal named buddy is a dog we also
might have an extremely general model
that just says any non-human animal is a
dog so we have kind of the extremes of
specificity and generality just like
with incremental concept learning before
we then start to get examples when we
get a positive example we're going to
generalize our specific model so let's
say now the child witness is a dog it's
a little bit bigger and is blonde and
has the name Scout now they're going to
generalize their specific model a bit so
then maybe the child sees a cat and is
told that the cat is not actually an
example of a dog so they specify their
general model maybe to leave out animals
with pointy ears just like before more
and more examples keep coming in but
this time with each new example removing
one concept or the other eventually what
we see is that the model that was
initially very specific and the model
that was initially very general have
converged so not only has this helped us
get to a understanding of the concept
but it's also figured out at what level
of abstraction we ought to understand
the concept notice that they would use
it to a model to refer to a concept in
fact use it on concept models almost
interchangeably this is actually quite
common for certain kinds of concepts we
have discussed earlier prototypical
concepts when we were discussing
classification but prototypical concepts
concepts are like models what is a model
a model is a representation of the world
such that there is a one-to-one
correspondence between what is being
represented the world and the
representation itself as an example in
the world of those blocks that made
arches I can actually make an arch in
the world and then I can build a
representation of that particular arch
that's a model of the world so the
concept of an arch and the model of an
arch in this particular case can be used
interchangeably</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
