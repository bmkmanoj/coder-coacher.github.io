that not just a single right answer
because you can build many test cases
that will satisfy this test
specification so for example we could
pick value 3 for a in value 9 for B
those satisfy the specification because
a plus B is equal to 12 and therefore is
greater than 0 and therefore this is the
test case that implements this test
specification and in terms of results
what we expect to see is in the case of
a result greater than 0 the color should
be red in the output value should be 12
analogously for this test specification
we just need to pick two inputs such
that the sum of the two inputs is less
than zero so for example we could pick
minus 5 and minus 8 the output color in
this case is going to be blue and the
output value is going to be minus 13 so
what we just saw is basically how we can
go from a piece of code to a set of
requirements which are the interesting
aspects of the code that we want to
exercise how we can satisfy the
requirements by finding the right test
specifications and then how we can
instantiate these test specifications
into actual test cases and this is what
we will do in general when doing white
box testing and we'll do it in slightly
different way depending on the specific
criteria that we are considering</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
