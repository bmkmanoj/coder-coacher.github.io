a relatively new trend as a vision it
existed for a very long time the oldest
description by John McCarthy predates
the technology by almost half a century
and it appeared in 61 he said the
following if computers of the kind I
have advocated become the computers of
the future then computing may someday be
organized as a public utility just as
the telephone system is a public utility
the computer utility could become the
basis of a new and important future if
we look at this statement it describes a
vision where computing is a utility just
like other utilities if we need more
electricity we just turn the switch on
we don't worry about where the
electricity actually comes from based on
this vision cloud computing should turn
the IT resource into a fungible utility
where we don't care about what type of
CPUs or disk ultimately used or where
they are virtualization technology is
one enabler in the process certainly
unfortunately there are still
limitations before this vision of just
seamless computing utility can be
realized for instance even with
virtualization there's still some
hardware dependencies that simply cannot
be masked so if software expects a
certain type of hardware platform to
execute then we cannot just have it run
on another type of resource then there
is the API walking and where if we're
using a particular cloud provider then
we're expected to continue using those
api's there isn't a uniform standard
across across cloud providers and then
unlike with some of these other
utilities were simply bringing data this
resource the electricity in in the case
cloud computing we're putting data
potentially core business services out
in the cloud so some of the privacy and
security concerns become much more
important clearly latency is an issue
given that there is an actual geographic
distance related to our accesses to a
remote cloth</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
