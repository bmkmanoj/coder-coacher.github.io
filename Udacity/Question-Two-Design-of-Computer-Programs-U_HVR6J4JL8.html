Lucca Giacomo and look wants to know
when the work of the compiler is really
really heavy and you have a really long
regular expression is there any way of
dumping out the final set of these
low-level machine instructions mm-hmm so
they can be called later yeah okay
that's a great question a couple answers
to that one is that within the regular
expression module the re module in
Python there is a compile statement that
takes a string in and returns a compiled
version of that regular expression and
so you can if you're running a program
once you can compile that regular
expression once at the very top of your
program and then use the compiled
expression each done now if you do that
explicitly then you're all set if you
don't the regular treshon module does
most of the work for you because what it
does is it keeps a little catch it does
something like memo eyes and keeps the
last few regular expressions that's done
and said I've seen this string before I
know what it compiles to I'll just fetch
that compiled object does that
automatically so that's within one run
of your program now another thing to
think about is between runs of your
program what if you've compiled
everything and then you don't want to
have the startup time of compiling it
over again there's another module called
pickle and you know what our pickles
their ways of storing cucumbers for a
long time so that they don't get rotten
so that's what the pickle module does it
takes an object that exists within the
running Python interpreter and writes it
out to disk in a form that can be read
back yet okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
