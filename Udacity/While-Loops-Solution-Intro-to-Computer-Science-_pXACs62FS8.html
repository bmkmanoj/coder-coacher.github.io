numbers from 1 to 10 and if we follow
through the code we can see why so
initially the value of I is 0 the test
says well I is not equal to 10 so 0 is
not equal to 10 so we go through the
block and the block adds 1 to I so that
will change the value of I now I refers
to 1 and then the next statement prints
the value of I the value of I now is 1
so it will print 1 and then because it's
the while we go back we do the test
again I'm not going to step through
every time so we keep doing this as I
gets bigger we're going to keep going
eventually let's say I is 9 and by the
time I is 9 well after I was 9 we print
9 so we've printed the numbers from 1
through 9 at this point I is still not
equal to 10 so we still go through the
loop body now we add 1 to I that will
make the value of I 10 then we do the
print so that will print out 10 then we
go back to the while test now the value
of I is 10 so I not equal to 10 10 not
equal to 10 is false because 10 does
equal 10 that means we're done with a
while loop and we're going to continue
there's nothing to continue with so
we're done so the net result of the code
is printing the numbers from 1 to 10 and
that's all that happens so now the test
is false we don't execute the block
anymore we would continue with the next
statement there isn't one so we're done
and what the code did was print out the
numbers from 1 to 10</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
