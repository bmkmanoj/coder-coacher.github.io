how if we encounter a problem that is
np-complete we can often using very
advanced algorithms still hope to find a
solution for those problems at least in
practice because you learned about
techniques such as intelligent search
trees and pre-processing now in this
unit we're going to investigate
something different so consider a
challenging problem such as measuring
the length of an elephant now doing that
exactly it's actually not that easy
because the elephant might be moving and
it might not like the ruler down here so
finding an exact solution such as the
elephant has a length of 5.10 7 meters
might actually be quite difficult thing
to do on the other hand if you allow for
a bit of sloppiness and say well let's
just estimate it at about 5 meters then
you can get a solution much faster what
we're going to look at in this unit is
if sloppiness are at least allowing for
a bit of leeway can actually help us
solve np-complete problems more
efficiently and what I mean by
sloppiness is the following let's say we
wanted to solve shortest tour what we
always asked was very demanding ly what
is the shortest tour no excuses no
leeway no sloppiness what is the
shortest tour and but what happened now
if we didn't ask what is the shortest
tour but rather asked the following what
is a pretty short tour so for example
20% within the optimum then we become
less demanding on what the algorithm is
supposed to produce and now of course
the question is will this allow us to
construct faster algorithms now before
we dive into this I would like you to
quickly think about this approach for a
bit in which scenarios might a sloppy or
not exact solution be acceptable so what
I would like you to think about for a
little bit is in what scenarios
approximation to the best possible
solutions would be acceptable so
approximation is the more formal term
for sloppiness and of course just to be
precise in this unit we're going to be
dealing with optimization problems you
can also talk about approximations to
decision problems but that's a bit of a
different scenario and actually we'll
get into that when we talk about
randomization but this is not part of
this unit here so would we be content
with approximations if the stakes are
low so we're solving an approximation
problem where nothing
is really critical I mean you might
spend a little bit more money but it's
not going to mess up research or
anything like that would it be
acceptable if the algorithm kind of
sounds good we do not have a provable
guarantee but it still appears to yield
good solutions and make sense in general
and what using an approximation be
acceptable if we find that exact
solutions are simply out of the question
we're using the best search tree we're
using pre-processing but still our
instances are so large and they behave
so badly that we just cannot find an
exact solution</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
