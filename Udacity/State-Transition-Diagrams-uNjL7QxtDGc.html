diagrams they're essentially represent
graphical representations of a finite
state machines in these diagrams we have
an indication of a node typically with
an oval or some kind of rectangle we
have arcs directed arcs connecting the
nodes indicating that there's a state
transition the arcs can be labelled the
arcs can be labeled with an action and a
transition typically the actions can be
can be optional usually but not always
the transitions are not optional okay if
you recall your finite state machines
from theory there are these epsilon
transitions we'll see in fact that the
garage door opener has one of these but
they're not they're not all that typical
note that the layout of the nodes where
we place them in the diagram doesn't
have any semantic import so you are free
to make the diagram lay it out in a way
that conveys what you consider to be the
important behavioral aspects of the
system in terms of how these diagrams
work you can think of yourself as at any
point in time being in a specific state
okay kind of waiting there until an
event happens when the event happens the
outgoing arcs are examined to determine
whether any of them are labeled with the
corresponding event and if so a
transition is made between the current
state and the state at the end of that
transition and in so doing the action if
any on that transition arc is is
executed</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
