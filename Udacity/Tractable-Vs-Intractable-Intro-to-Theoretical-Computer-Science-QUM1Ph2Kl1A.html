of polynomial running time being
associated with tractability and
exponential running time being
associated with intractability can lead
to some borderline cases where you would
probably argue so for example if you had
an algorithm that had polynomial running
time of O of n to the power of 10 and
you had an exponential running time
algorithm with running time one point
zero one to the power of n then actually
it would be very hard to decide which
which one of these algorithms to take it
would kind of depend on additional
information so what other constant
factors here and what is what is the
size of n as I mentioned before this
hardly occurs in practice and this
hardly occurs in practice as well so
tractable problems are usually really
tractable and intractable problems tend
to be intractable in general but in
later units we'll actually see how you
can deal with exponential running times
so the question we're now dealing with
is both for Alice's problem and Bob's
problem
are they intractable or can we find a
polynomial time algorithm that would
show us that these problems are
tractable so so far Alice and Bob really
don't have a good idea on how to tackle
that problem so that's why they actually
decide to get together and discuss with
each other the problems that they are
trying to solve and to that meeting they
also invite a friend of theirs and that
friend of theirs is Carol because as
they have learned carol is also working
on a problem that so far she has only
found an exponential time algorithm for</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
