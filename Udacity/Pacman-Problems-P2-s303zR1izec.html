to take what are the things you would
tell me to do there's like eating the
dots yeah I like that so that that seems
like a reasonable thing to do u dot I
guess the little dots versus the big
dots that they might be two different
things because I want to eat it big dot
if I want to turn the tables on the
ghosts and pursue them right okay so
i'll just call the little dot dot okay
and then I feel like it's really
important to have a have a strategy for
escaping from the ghosts or pursuing the
ghost depending on the mode okay so yeah
so you might want to eat a ghost and you
might want to avoid it goes anything
else I mean I guess we could come up
with more detailed strategy ideas but
but those are those feel like the basic
things yeah I think that pretty much
covers it and if you were when we go
back and we listened to the recording
later Michael I think you'll find that
this is almost exactly what you said
when you explained how the game work you
said you need to eat the little dots oh
and you also have to eat the big dots
eventually because you need to clear
them you you if the ghost touch you then
you die so we need to avoid the ghost
but if you eat the big dots then you can
actually the ghosts and that's pretty
much how you describe the game I see so
the way that I kind of thought about the
game to convey it to people is it this
sort of high level that kind of makes
sense with respect to options as well
right which is what I also think was
true in the other good world now we
could look at this and we say well these
are options and and maybe we can learn
these options or they're given to us
somebody could code them up for us I
don't know I want to point out a couple
of things about these options so and
this is going to bring us back to your
excellent analogy about programming and
about computing which is if we think of
these things as functions or procedures
to execute which i think is a perfectly
reasonable thing to do I want to point
out that what we get from functions
procedures is not just the ability to
reason at a high level but we also get
something called separate something
called separation of concerns which
allows us to only think about parts of
the world so for example if you want me
to multiply two numbers I only have to
worry about those two numbers I don't
have to worry about you know
the state of the stack or whatever else
is going on in this program I just need
to worry about the two numbers you're
asking me to multiply so there's a
similar kind of gain and abstraction
that you get here by picking options
carefully so to illustrate this I'm
going to ask you to do one more thing I
want you to tell me what are the states
of this world what are the features that
make up the states in pac-man ok so
there's well it's definitely different
if there's any dots left versus there's
no dots left right so important
distinction so the dots and where they
are on the screen matter so oh you you
want ok so not an abstraction of the
state you actually want literally the
things that make up the state oh well
which I claim as an abstraction of the
state almost by definition so I'm I
think what you said before works in
either case right so they're dots their
dots on the screen I need to know where
all the dots are and so there's some set
of features that make up the state that
tell me where thoughts are right ok so
and then there's where the packman is
the location of the little dots location
of the big dots location of the pac-man
location of the ghosts and I guess the
walls aren't really part of the state in
the sense that they don't really change
though i guess if we were talking about
multiple levels of the game we might
have to also say where the walls are
true i'm going to claim that um you
don't have to do that because it's all
going to be taken care of about you
could and there's nothing wrong with it
but it's actually all gonna be taken
care by the transition function right
there's you can't inner wall so you
can't from a state go into where wall
happens to be ok and oh oh whether the
ghosts are in I want I don't know what
to call it but power pellet mode whether
the ghosts are fleeing from us or
whether they're attacking us right so we
talk about scared go scared whether the
coats are scared I see they always look
a little scared with the bulgy eyes
right uh not when they're coming after
you they don't but when they start
blinking purple and they're running away
from you and screaming aah then they
seem a little scared too maybe it's just
my pressure magnet anyway so here's a
bunch of features and you know the
details here you know matter and
implementation but I think for we're
talking about don't write we talk about
where the dots are doesn't have to be
where the
sorry could be where the closest dot is
to you or where the farthest not is to
your could be every single dot and
whether it's on or off same true for the
big dots pac-man I mean you have to know
where pac-man is you need to know where
ghosts or maybe just need to care about
where the closest ghost is whatever I
mean it does matter whether they're
scared or not in the same way that we
don't have to keep track of the walls or
other things that we might not have to
keep track of but whatever it is we're
going to do in the detail I think to
solve the game I think your reasoning is
right you need to know where the dots
are of various flavors we need to know
where the ghosts and where we are and we
need to know whether we can eat the
ghost or not and these features however
they're exactly expressed are important
for solving and planning in the game now
here's the observation I'm going to make
just like when i asked you to multiply
two numbers I don't need to know
everything else that's going on your
program I suspect that is the case that
even though I need all of these features
to effectively and efficiently solve a
pacman board my options do not
necessarily need to know all of these
things so for example if you told me to
avoid the ghost ask yourself whether it
matters whether the ghosts are scared or
not interesting ok yeah I guess if I'm
if I am avoiding the ghosts well
actually etch it changes their behavior
so it made it may depend on that sure
right so I think we should delve into
this little more deeply and the way I
want to do that is with a quiz</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
