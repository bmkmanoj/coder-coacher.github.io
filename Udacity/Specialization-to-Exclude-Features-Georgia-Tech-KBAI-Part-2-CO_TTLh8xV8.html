bit further imagine that the teacher
gives this as its herd example to the AI
program this time again you have three
bricks but the two vertical bricks are
touching each other so here is a
representation of this input example
three bricks the two vertical bricks are
supporting this brick at the top however
the two bricks are touching each other
recall this is the current concept
definition that the AI program has there
are the must support links here and here
is a representation of the new example
and the AI program knows that this is a
negative example how my taa program
refine or specialized this particular
current definition so that this negative
example is excluded well the air program
may say that the current definition can
be revised in such a way that for these
two bricks where one is left of the
other one these two bricks cannot touch
each other this particular symbol means
not so it is saying that this brick does
not touch that one and we have bad
direction links because this one cannot
touch the other one and that one cannot
touch this one this is called the 4-bit
link heuristic so here some particular
link in this particular case touches is
being forbidden</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
