prediction we're going to have a table
that we will call a branch history table
or BHT we will take the PC of the
instruction grab the least significant
bits and that's what we index into this
table with so it's the same as when
indexing into the BTB but the entry here
is much smaller
the simplest predictor will simply have
a 1 bit here that tells us if this is a
not a taken branch meaning it's a non
branch or a not taken branch or when
it's 1 it says that this is a taken
branch if we get a 0 from here we just
increment the PC if we get a 1 we use
the BTB to tell us where to go just like
we were updating the BTB we can update
this once we resolve the branch if we
resolve to a taken branch then we put a
1 here and we write the destination
address into the BTB if we get a 0 if we
decide that the branch is not-taken or
that the instruction is not a branch
then we put a 0 here and we don't update
the BTB so that we can use the BTB
only for target addresses that we really
really need the BTB for because an entry
here can be only a single bit this table
can be quite large so we can have lots
of instructions have entries here
avoiding conflicts between instructions
that commonly execute while still
reserving the small BTB which has much
fewer entries only for branches in that
