and Carol are both very very happy not
because they've actually solved that
problem but now they know at least they
can collaborate they've basically
doubled their chances so if any one of
them finds a good algorithm for their
problem they all know they have a good
polynomial time algorithm for both of
their problems Alice also arrives to the
meeting and of course Alice is very
excited to hear about the discovery that
Bob and Carol have made so Alice of
course is hoping that maybe she can also
find a connection of her problem to Bob
and Carols problem or at least that they
can help her find a good algorithm for a
problem by brainstorming Alice explains
her problem using the graph terminology
as well so Alice's problem as you will
remember is to find a set of vertices so
that all of the edges are covered in a
network here for example if you take
these three then each edge has at least
one endpoint in the set of green
vertices here so the input for Alice's
problem is again a graph with n vertices
and the output is the smallest set of
vertices such that all edges are covered
and of course you know what I mean by
covered by covered I mean that each Edge
has at least one endpoint in that set of
vertices so again we should give that
problem a name to refer to it so just as
bob was working on clique and carol was
working on independent set we have Alice
working on her problem and since she is
using the vertices to cover the edges
will call her problem vertex cover</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
