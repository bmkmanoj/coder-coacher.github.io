to notice this these types of
transformations can be combined to
achieve a transformation we are taking
single image and then of course use that
to generate a translated image this has
been translated then of course I rotate
this image by amount theta and then of
course I actually add to it things like
sheer so in essence this basically shows
that to get these set of parameters here
which basically now show translation
this is where this comes in this kind of
rotates the image theta that we looked
at and this of course also shares it by
a certain amount and shares it in this
amount again noted by these ratios here
so of course X Y W here can be combined
into this and we can simplify this by
looking at that basically now there are
nine parameters here in this matrix and
if we knew these and combinations of
these of course noting here that these
combinations can be done a priority and
saved up and apply to an image whenever
we want now one thing I mean may want to
talk about right here is most the time
this I value would be one because
remember the current condition we had
with our WS w always wants to come out
to be a w on both sides and that would
be the case here so most of the time
we're looking for these eight parameters
okay so let's look at what that means</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
