great if our viewcontroller where the
recording happens was called something
other than just view controller in
writing your app there are times when
you might want to rename your classes
and it takes just a minute let me show
you to rename our view controller we're
going to do three steps we want to
change the name of the view controller
to record sounds view controller first
in the project navigator select the view
controller dot Swift file and single
click change the name to record sounds
view controller open the class we just
rename and change the name in the
comments and in the class declaration to
record sounds view controller you can
press command s to save this file one
last step we have to tell the main that
storyboard that the view controller for
this view is no longer called view
controller dot Swift but it's now called
record sounds view controller open the
main that storyboards file and select a
view controller for our first view
switch to the identity inspector and
change its name to record sounds view
controller press return to make this
take effect that's all it takes to
change the name of a class next let's
add the avrt record the code you saw
earlier</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
