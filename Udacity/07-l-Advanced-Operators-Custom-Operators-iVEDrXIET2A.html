is custom operators custom operators
allow us to define completely new
operators that we can use in our code to
create a new operator we need to specify
what kind of operator it is first is it
a prefix operator an infix operator or a
postfix operator so you specify the type
of operator operator and then the symbol
you want to use for the operator so
we'll use the bank symbol in this case
so now that we know what the symbol is
for this operator we need to define a
function that tells the compiler what
kind of operand it accepts and what it
returns the reason I'm using the word
operand instead of parameter is that's
just conventional when we're talking
about operators the arguments that they
accept are referred to as operands this
one keeps things simple and it takes a
string operand and it returns a string
then what the operator actually does is
add the dist prefix to whatever the word
operand was and now we can use this
operator right in our code and we can
see that we get disassociate and
disconnect and disappear now let's look
at an infix operator for an infix
operator we need to define its
associativity and precedence and so it's
a little bit different than the prefix
operator here we've assigned this to
left associative and it's precedence to
155 and then the rest of the operator
definition continues like we saw for
this operator we're going to take two
operands which are integers and then
return another int I'm going to give you
a second to see if you can figure out
what this operator is actually doing so
go ahead take a second and see if you
can figure it out if you guessed
exponentiation or the exponent then you
got it right so for this first example
we have here we're raising five to the
second power and this gives us a result
of 25 and then we take and chain it
together so this is actually computing
25 I could just write 25 and then it's
raising that to the second power and
giving us 625 now I'll skip on down to
the bottom for our postfix example this
definition is similar to the prefix
example and it takes
one operand and returns the result in
this case we're taking an INT and we're
returning a double so you'll notice that
it doesn't have to be the case that the
types of the operands matched the return
type and this operator is pretty slick
it converts an integer followed by a %
into its decimal representation now
that's pretty cool</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
