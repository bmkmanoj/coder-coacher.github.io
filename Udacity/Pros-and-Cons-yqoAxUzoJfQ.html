segmentation it has some strengths it's
very simple to do by the way it's
guaranteed to converge you can sort of
show that um but it has some distinct
challenges first of all it tends to be
very memory intensive because you're
keeping all of your points and you're
shuffling them around in a membership
way perhaps one of the biggest ones
actually is two big ones one is here's
you need to tell it k you need to tell
it how many points there are how many
clusters there are a priori you can try
to discover that but k-means doesn't
know anything about how to do that it's
it's sensitive to initialization and
outliers and in particular what it's
looking for are nice essentially
spherical clusters where their spherical
and feature space that is it doesn't
want any point to be too far away and
the problem with that can be illustrated
in figure looks like this so here is a
figure with two clusters in it this one
here and this one there now I've drawn
them or i should say they've been drawn
in red and blue to help you think that
they should be separate but if you if
you were to look at that pattern in just
black and white you probably would say
well there's this bent cluster here and
then there's this bent cluster there but
of course if you were to run k-means you
would get what's shown here this would
be one cluster and that would be another
cluster because k-means is looking for
these spherical clusters</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
