desperate to have these epileptic
seizures stop that he agreed to brain
surgery and so the doctors in fact took
out the hippocampi both sides
bilaterally and it worked the seizures
stopped in both severity and frequency
but at a horrible cost Henry could no
longer form new long-term memories so
for instance he would forget what he had
for breakfast that day he could work for
hours and hours with a psychologist but
if she went away for 15 or 20 minutes
and came back he would forget completely
who she was he would also be able to
watch TV follow along with the program
but as soon as a commercial came along
he would forget what the program was
what it was about he call so with
difficulty with concentration could
solve a crossword puzzle but if he was
interrupted at all he would forget what
he was doing and not be able to solve it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
