a times 1 this is the same as a equals a
because anything x 1 is just itself so
this assigns the new value of a to be
equal to the old value of a so this is
actually equal to just doing nothing so
I could totally remove this line without
changing the result of Plato's Republic
begets B plus 0 is the same sort of
theory this reduces to be gets be
because adding 0 to something doesn't
change its value so I could just drop
this statement entirely a equals a plus
B that looks like something important
might be going on let's hold on to that
for a bit in fact let's go down here and
see eventually we're returning a I can't
remove this line because we actually
need to return a to have the same value
and if I'm going to return a then I need
to keep this line a gets a plus B so
that I know what the right value of a is
supposed to be but and this is the
potentially tricky bit I can remove B
equals B plus 2 even though there's no
arithmetic simple of simplification that
I could perform I just don't need the
line B isn't part of the return value no
one else can ever see it we throw it
away after this point formerly in
computer science we call this dead code
it has no effect on the rest of the
program so I could drop these three
lines and olive plate and all that
Plato's Republic is really doing is
summing its two variables together
returning the result Plato's Republic is
a dialogue written in about 380 BCE that
talks about the definition of justice
the phrase who watches the Watchers
often comes up in discussions or
criticisms of Plato's Republic</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
