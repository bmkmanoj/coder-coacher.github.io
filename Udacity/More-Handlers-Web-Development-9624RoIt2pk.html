file first thing we're gonna do is were
going to get rid of this Google Action
and replace it with slash test form and
now that's going to cause our form when
we submit it to submit to slash test
form instead of to Google and since our
application can only respond to slash
we're going to need to add a handler for
that as well so we'll come down here to
our URL handler section and because we
only have a handler for slash we're
gonna add another handler for slash test
form slash test form will be handled by
the handler called test handler which
doesn't exist yet let's create that okay
so we've added this new handler called
test handler this also has of a method
on it called get like our other handler
and what this does is it sets a variable
called Q which comes from self dot
request like response is the object that
represents the response we're going to
send back to the client request
represents the request that came from
the browser and you can call get on it
to get different parameters so in this
case we're going to get the parameter Q
and then all we're going to do is we're
gonna return on the response self dot
response dot out dot write Q so if we go
to our browser we enter enter some words
and we hit submit we see the string
hello world you can see in the URL Q
equals hello world which is what we
entered so this is hitting the same URL
we were at hitting before but this time
there's a web application on the other
end listening for requests and returning
responses the exclamation mark turned
into a percent 21 that was the escaping
I was referring to before okay now I'd
like to make another change I'm going to
comment out these two lines and show you
something neat I'm going to take this
this content type line from up here
because we're going to use this because
we want to print some text and we want
it to work properly this time instead of
writing out Q I'm gonna write out self
dot request itself okay let's go to our
browser and try this out here's our form
you may have to go back to URL and
reload that's fine
okay so type some text in there and in
the form and click submit when you click
Submit what just happened did you see
garbage do you see the HTTP request do
see a message from the future or nothing
happens at all</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
