Shapley have a bunch of different
quantities state's actions transitions
rewards and discount factors and here's
how we're gonna do it we're gonna we're
gonna say that s little s is one of the
states and actions could be like little
a but actually since we're gonna focus
mostly on two-player games for the
moment I'm gonna write actions as a and
B where a is an action for player one
and B is an action for player two sound
okay
surely all right so next we have the
transition function so the transition
function says if you're in some state s
and there's some joint action that's
taken like all the players choose their
action simultaneously a comma P then
what's the probability of reaching some
next state s prime and we could write
rewards the same way so there's reward
for player one given that we're in state
s and there's a joint action a B and
there's the reward for this at the other
player second player and the discount
factor is you know like a discomfort
it's really make sense so I was the same
discount factor for everyone yes good
good point one need not define things
that way but in fact that's the way it's
always defined hey now not to go off on
a tangent here but sometimes I see MVPs
and things like stochastic games to find
with a discount factor being a part of
the definition and sometimes not like
it's just a part of the petition of the
problem or sometimes it's a parameter of
an algorithm which you prefer why do you
why having why have the discount factor
actually listed as part of the
definition of the game I have no
justification other than it's nice to
have listed the things that might be
important as opposed to you know working
through algorithms for a while and then
saying oh yeah there's this other number
that kind of matters to okay that's fair
I was just curious so one of the things
that I actually find really interesting
is that this model was laid out by
Shapley one of the like a former Nobel
Prize winner
I guess what's your Nobel Prize winner
your Nobel Prize winner forever Shapley
then Nobel Prize winner and as we're
gonna see in a moment this model is
actually a generalization of MVPs but
Shapley published it before bellman
published about MVPs oh this is pre
Billman so MDPs to some extent can be
thought of as a narrowing of the
definition of a stochastic game huh so
all right
to do a little quiz and see that we
really understand the relationship
between this model and other things that
we've talked about okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
