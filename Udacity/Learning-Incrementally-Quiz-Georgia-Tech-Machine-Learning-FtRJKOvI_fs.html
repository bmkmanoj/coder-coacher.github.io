that to help us kind of make sense of
the equations in the Q learning equation
by looking at a simpler case so let's
imagine that we've got some variable V
and some sequence of values X and a
sequence of learning rate alpha sub T so
we're gonna draw a series of these X
values and use them to update the V
values and the learning rate is changing
over time and the learning rate is going
to have the fo first of all X is going
to be drawn X of T is going to be drawn
from some the distribution of some
random variable big X and the learning
rates are gonna satisfy two properties
one is that the sum of the learning
rates sums up to infinity but the sum of
the squares of the learning rate as we
go to infinity sums up to something less
than infinity so can can you think of us
learning rate sequence that has that
property so the one that I remember is
alpha sub T equals one over T good so in
fact there's a whole range of possible
powers of T that work here but one over
T is a good one why is this why is it
satisfy the properties well if you sum
up the values up to some value T sum up
the 1 over I values it actually acts
like the natural logarithm and so as T
goes to infinity the sum goes to
infinity but logarithmically which is
still you know infinity mm-hmm but if
you look at the sums of the squares
that's actually a well-known problem
called the I think the basal problem
basal problem and it turns out to
actually be PI squared over 6 which is
kind of crazy which is a finite value
that's that's intuitively obvious even
to the most casual observer no I really
this it's it's it's wacky it was an open
problem for a long time and then it was
finally solved and it's like yeah sure
PI squared over 6 like where's the PI in
here there's no PI in there all right
but that's not high anywhere that's
neither here nor there the hope the
point is that there's there's a bunch of
sequences of learning rates that satisfy
this property and we're gonna imagine
that we have a sequence of learning
rates that satisfies this property we're
going to be updating V sub T with a
series of X values drawn from some
distribution big X and what I'm asking
is what do you think this converges to
do you think it converges to the
expected value of x do you think maybe
it just doesn't converge at all do you
think it converges to the variance of X
the random variable X or does it
converge to infinity it just keeps
without bound all right does that seem
like a well-formed question oh sure all
right so let's give you a chance to
think about it okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
