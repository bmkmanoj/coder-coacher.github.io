we've done fractions we've worked with
multiplying dividing adding and
subtracting them let's try something new
have you ever wondered why your skin
cells get replaced the skin cells on the
top of your hand end up getting replaced
eventually they die off and they just
fly away you don't ever see them
disappear but they get replaced by newer
cells underneath the top layer of your
skin so here's what it would look like
for one cell to replicate so let's start
with one cell and see what happens one
cell is going to split into two cells
it's going to double I have one cell and
another song then each of these cells
are also going to double this one will
make two cells and this one will make
two cells and then these four cells will
also split each one will make two new
cells so here's my question how many
cells would there be after seven rounds
of division by the end of the segment
you'll be able to answer this question
we're going to figure this out using
exponents okay this is just one cell
this is before any rounds of division so
I'm going to mark that off with a zero
this is after the first round of the
division I have two cells and then after
the second round of division I have four
cells and then after the third round of
division I have eight cells I know my
cells doubled every time so I'm going to
use a base of 2 okay i know i started
with one cell and that cell doubled so i
have 1 times 2 then each of these cells
also doubled so i have two cells
doubling or two times two then i have
four cells each of these four cells also
doubled so i have 2 times 2 those are my
four cells and then they're going to
double there's got to be an easier way
to write this we're going to actually do
this using exponents notice that all my
multiplication as a 22 is going to be my
base after the first doubling I have two
to the one or two cells after the second
doubling i have 2 to the two or four
cells and after three rounds of doubling
i have 2 to the 3 or eight cells and
after three rounds of dev lane i have 2
to the third or eight cells repeated
multiplication is represented by an
exponent it's very similar to repeated
addition like 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 i know i
have four threes or four times three we
use multiplication to represent repeated
addition
use exponents to represent repeated
multiplication so whenever I have a
repeated multiplication I can write the
base raised to an exponent so whenever I
have repeated multiplication I can have
the base raised to an exponent</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
