regression which is a way of building a
model where we represent the model with
a number of parameters let's start with
a simple example suppose we want to
build a model that will predict how much
it will rain today based on changes in
barometric pressure so as you may know
if barometric pressure declines that
usually means there's bad weather coming
and it's going to rain and when
barometric pressure increases it
typically means that we've got good
weather coming so on the scatterplot
each individual point represents one day
so let's consider a particular day say
here and what this means is that on this
day the barometric pressure decreased by
10 millimeters and we had 50 millimeters
of rain about two inches so let's
consider that over time we collect data
for many different days and that's what
this looks like so again each one of
these dots represents one day's worth of
data and we have multiple days worth of
data here and as you can see there's a
general trend of as barometric pressure
decreases we typically have more rain
and as it increases we have less rain
we'd like to create a model based on
this data then when we query it at any
particular point it will give us a
prediction of how much is going to rain
so we would measure barometric pressure
or its change and then estimate how much
is going to rain the classic solution to
this problem is to fit a line to the
data so let's give that a shot
as you probably know this approach is
called linear regression and the model
looks like this so if you remember from
algebra in elementary school or high
school wherever you got it the equation
for a line is simply y equals MX plus B
so X is our barometric pressure change
variable here and M and B are the
parameters of our model our model now is
fully described by these two parameters
and if we went to s
mate or query how much it's going to
rain at any particular point we measure
the barometric pressure let's say the
barometric pressure today increased by
five we would then plug that five into
our model here and you know multiply it
by M and add B and that's our estimate
for that day of how much it's going to
rain and the linear regression approach
is how we arrive at M and B this model
is decent but it doesn't track the
actual behavior of the data for instance
in this region and in this region so we
can make a more complex model instead of
fitting a line we can fit a polynomial
we can add one more term x squared and
now we've got to also find this
additional parameter M two so when we
find our model it's now represented by
three parameters m M 2 and B this
polynomial model will look something
like this
it fits the data pretty well over here
but not so well over here now we can add
more terms we can fit an x cubed term
and have another parameter and so on
in general these parametric approaches
come away with a number of parameters
and the more complex the model the more
parameters still you know three
parameters is a pretty simple model all
of these models whether it's linear with
just MX plus B or polynomial with a
cubed or a squared term are parametric
models in the end after we learn these
models we have our parameters in this
case M 2 m and B and we throw away the
data and the model is represented just
by these three parameters but there's
another way to approach it and I'll show
you that next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
