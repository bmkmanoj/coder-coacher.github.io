tell you about a new tool called a
generator function which is almost the
same as a generator expression I will
show you what it looks like I'm going to
define a function to iterate over the
integers from some start to some end and
this is going to be just like range
range is a great function but sometimes
it's annoying because you really don't
want to go to one less than the end you
want to go up all the way to the end so
that's what in siz going to do and I'm
going to implement it as a generator
function I'm going to start off with an
integer I that starts at the start
number that you told me and then while I
is less than or equal to the end I'm
gonna introduce a new type of statement
here called yield and I say yield I and
then I say I equals I plus 1 now the
yield is something new and it makes this
definition a generator function rather
than a regular function and what that
means is what's going to happen is it's
going to execute as soon as it sees this
yield statement it's going to generate
that value i but keep its place and when
asked for the next it will continue
incrementing i and then continuing
through the loop and so when we call
this function if we say say l equals the
integers from zero to a million now L
won't be a list right away it'll be a
generator so now L is equal to this
generator some funny object and then you
call next of L to get the next object
and you keep on going through and more
commonly instead of calling next
explicitly you'd say for I in L and so
generators obey this iteration protocol
just like other types of sequences and
the great thing is we can yield from
anywhere inside this function so we
could have very complicated logic here
and then yield a partial result and then
continue getting the next result right
where we are so this is a convenient
feature for writing functions and
another great thing about generator
functions is it allows us to deal with
infinite sequences let's say we wanted
to allow the possibility of an
open-ended interval of integers and
we'll make and be an optional argument
which can be none
and the idea is that if we have a call
say it's starting at zero but I don't
give it an end then that means all the
non-negative integers 0 1 2 3 going on
forever and never stopping and the
question for you is how would you modify
generator function in order to make it
obey this idea of never stopping when
end is equal to none and you should be
able to modify just this line here to
make it obey this idea that it should
keep on going forever
when end is none</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
