meters per second this train is going
two times ten to the eighth meters per
second remember the speed of light C is
three times ten to the eighth meters per
second so the trains moving at
two-thirds the speed of light obviously
no train could actually do that well no
train except for the train of physics
okay and let's get this guy out of here
things are getting dangerous on this
train let's put them down here by the
side of the tracks where he can safely
watch the train as it goes by let's also
imagine this train has one of those
really cool and powerful train
headlights so we know that the speed of
the train is two times ten to the eighth
meters per second relative to the ground
and this person standing there and the
speed of light is three times ten to the
eighth meters per second now what I want
to know at what speed is the light
approach bill and I've named our guy
down here bill and I'll give you a hint
it's something times ten to the eighth
meters per second it's either one two
three four five six seven eight or nine
and you just have to enter the
appropriate number here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
