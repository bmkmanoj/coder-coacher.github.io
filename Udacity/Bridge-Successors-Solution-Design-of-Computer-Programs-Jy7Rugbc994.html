solution came out a little bit more
complicated than i expected it to and I
think maybe I made a bad choice for the
representation I threw in the the
flashlight along with the set of people
because I figured you want one set to
represent everything that's on one side
but I thinking now after this came out
the way that it did that maybe I should
have had the flashlight be a separate
part of the state in other words have
the state before tuple not of things
that are here are there but of people
that are here are there and then the
time and then a fourth element being the
flashlight saying where is the
flashlight and that could either be true
or false saying it's is it here or it
could be a character string saying it's
there or here or it could be an integer
0 or 1 I think it might have been easier
if I chosen one of those representations
but it didn't bother me enough to go
back and make a change if you want to
you could spend time refactoring and
change that I'm going to just push ahead
so here's what i did i said if the light
is here then let's look at all the
people in here and we'll look at all the
pairs of people a and B and to make sure
that they're people i have to say that
they're not the light and so for all
pairs of people a and b we can generate
a successor state which is the set of
people that were here minus the two
people and the light because the light
is going to move from here to there and
the second part of the successor state
is everything that was already over on
the other side on their unioned with the
things that are coming over which are
people a and B and the light and then
the time is the time plus the maximum
time that it took for a and B to get
over and then I know it says in the
specification here that the action is
represented just by an arrow and if I
want to get the problem right I would do
that but then I decided later on well
maybe the action should be more than
just the arrow maybe the action should
also tell me who went across so I have
the option of doing that if i want to
just solve the problem the way it was
specified then i would return just the
arrow to represent the action
and I would do the same thing over here
so one settle T of this that worked out
well in my favor you know it's a little
bit messy dealing with frozen sets and I
like the the idea that the name is so
long but I didn't have to consider
separately the idea of one person going
across and two person going across
because we were dealing with sets the
set of people a be when a is equal to B
is equal to one person so I get them
under ssin crossing for free so that's
one nice thing about right
representation but notice that
everything is in flux here that I'm
trying to choose a good representation
I'm changing my mind as I go along
should the actions be represented by a
single arrow or should they be
represented by an arrow along with the
names of the people that are going
that's all up in flux and I should say
that that type of flux is ok as long as
it remains contained so if you have
uncertainties that are going to cross
barriers between lots of different
functions then probably you want to nail
them down if you think that they're
contained then it's ok to have some
under uncertainty and be able to explore
the exact options later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
