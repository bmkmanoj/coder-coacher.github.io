when you think about full virtualization
later transfer is implicit any data
movement that has to happen between the
hypervisor and the fully virtualized
operating system happens implicitly in a
para virtualized setting for example in
Xen there is an opportunity again to
innovate because you can be explicit
about the data movement from the guest
operating system into the hypervisor and
vice-versa there are two aspects to
resource management and accountability
when it comes to data transfer the first
is the CPU time so when an interrupt
comes in for instance from a device
hypervisor has to demultiplex the data
that is coming from the device to the
domains very quickly upon an interrupt
and the recipie you time involved in
making such copies and the hypervisor
has to account for the computation time
for managing the buffers on behalf of
the virtualized operating system above
it the CPU time accountability is
crucial from the point of view of
billing in data centers and therefore
hypervisors pay a lot of attention to
how CPU time is accounted for and
charged to the appropriate virtual
machines the second aspect of the data
transfer is how the memory buffers are
managed there is a space issue the first
is a time issue CPU time issue the
second is a space issue meaning how are
the memory buffers allocated and how
they managed either by the guest
operating system or by the hypervisor as
I said in the context of full
virtualization there is a very little
scope for innovation in but in the
context of para virtualization there is
a lot of scope for innovation in the way
memory buffers are handled between the
guest operating system and the
hypervisor specifically looking at Xen
as an instance of para virtualization
let's look at the opportunities for
innovation in the guest OS - Xen
communication Xen provides asynchronous
i/o rings which is basically a data
structure that is shared between the
guest and the Zen for communication
any number of these little structures
that is any number of these IO rings can
be allocated for handling all the device
IO needs of a particular guest domain
the IO ring itself is just a set of
descriptors what you see here they're
all descriptors that are available in
this data structure and it's a ring data
structure and that's why it's called IO
ring and we'll talk about how it is used
in a minute
the idea is requests from the guests
can be placed in this i/o ring by
populating these descriptors every
descriptor is a unique IO request coming
from the guest operating system so every
request is going to have a unique ID
associated with that particular request
coming from the guest operating system
and recall what I said earlier that is
the i/o ring is specific to a guest so
every guest can declare a set of i/o
rings as data structures for its
communication with Xen now in responding
to the request from the guest then after
it competes processing the request it
will place a response back in the same
IO ring in one of these descriptors and
that response is going to have the same
unique ID that was used to communicate
the request in the first place so it's
sort of a symmetric relationship between
the guest and Xen in terms of request
and response for things that the guests
want Xen to get done on its behalf and
for them to communicate back to the
guest that it has completed whatever was
requested of sin so the guest is the
producer of requests so it has a pointer
into this data structure that says where
it has to place the next request so this
is a pointer that is manipulated meaning
modified by the guest but it is readable
by Zen so there's only one guy that can
modify there is a guest but Xen can look
at this pointer it's a shared pointer in
that sense for example the guest
operating system may have placed
you requests and that's why it has moved
its pointer to here indicating that it
has placed new requests to the next
empty spot where it can place new
requests after these two requests the
consumer for the request produced by the
guest operating system is of course Zen
and it is processing requests in the
order in which they have been produced
by the guest operating system and
therefore it has a pointer into this i/o
ring data structure saying where exactly
it is presently servicing request from
this guest operating system so right now
the pointer is pointing here indicating
that Zen is yet to process these two
requests that have been queued by the
producer meaning the guest operating
system into this i/o ring data structure
so this pointer that the request
consumer has is private to Zen it is
just telling Zen where it is in
processing requests from the producer
and the difference between these two
pointers is telling how many requests
are outstanding so far as L is concerned
in terms of processing requests
emanating from the guest similar to
request production Zen is going to be
the guy that is authoring responses back
to the guest operating system so Zen is
the response producer so it's going to
have a pointer where it can place new
responses so once again this pointer is
a shared pointer updated by Zen but can
be read by the guest so these are two
new responses that Zen has placed in the
i/o ring in response to requests that it
has already processed but these
responses have not yet been picked up by
the producer the guest operating system
has a pointer that says where it is in
this IO ring data structure in terms of
picking up the responses coming from Zen
Zen has produced these two new responses
as a result of processing some prior
requests from the guest operating system
but the guest operating system is yet to
process these requests so this pointer
is private to the guest operating system
that is telling it where it is in
processing responses coming back from
Xen the difference between this pointer
and this pointer is the number of
responses that are yet to be picked up
by the guest operating system just to
recap the difference between these two
pointers is a number of requests that
are yet to be processed by then and the
difference between these two pointers is
the number of responses that are yet to
be picked up by the guest and these
slots are the empty slots into which new
requests can be placed by the request
producers the request producer moves
like this and the response taker moves
like this and the response producer
moves like this and the request consumer
moves like this and these are the empty
slots into which then can place
additional responses as it processes
more requests from the guest operating
system that's the idea behind this i/o
ring data structure very powerful
abstraction that allows the guests to
place requests asynchronously and for
Xen to place responses asynchronously
into this data structure as I mentioned
already the guest can identify the
request for which a particular response
is intended because the ID that is
associated with the response is going to
be exactly the same as the ID that was
associated with the request in the first
place the other thing that we should
remember is that these are just
descriptors of the requests and
responses any data that has to be passed
from the guests to Xen will just be a
pointer from these descriptors to a
machine page that the guest owns so that
Xen can pick up the data directly from
that machine page without any copy
similarly if the response is given by
Xen is going to have data associated
with it that'll again be a pointer from
the descriptor data structure to the
machine page that contains the data that
Xen wants to pass up to the guest
in other words this asynchronous i/o
rings as a powerful mechanism both for
efficient communication between the
guests and Zen and for also avoiding
copying overhead between the para
virtualized guest operating system and
Zen which is the virtualization layer we
will look at two specific examples on
how these IO rings are used for guest
and Zen communication</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
