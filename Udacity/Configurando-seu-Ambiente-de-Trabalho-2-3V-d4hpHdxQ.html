lesson called variables can vary and I
want to keep a record of the code that
he writes in this video so I'm actually
just going to write it myself in my
starter code file and after I copy the
code I'm going to add some comments that
tell me what this code is all about and
why it's important i think i'll even
include a link to the video so i can go
back and reference it later in Python
you can add notes to a code file by
using the pound symbol basically that
tells the computer to ignore everything
on that line after the pound symbol so
this way i can write stuff that is meant
for people to read instead of computers
when i come to a quiz node i can choose
to switch to my browser and answer the
quiz in the Udacity classroom or i can
write my answer in my starter code file
and just copy and paste it over when i'm
ready to submit I think I'll do that
that way I can keep a record of my quiz
code just for my own reference awesome I
pass the quiz if I ever want to see what
any of my code does I can easily do that
in sublime all I have to do is go up to
the menu bar click tools and then go to
build or as a shortcut I can press
command be on Mac or ctrl be on windows
when I click build a screen shows on the
bottom of my sublime window and it shows
the output of my code doing this often
will really help me get into the habit
of running my code and it will help me a
lot when I start working on big projects
all right this is looking pretty good
I'll save this file on my computer in a
place where I'll keep all of my intro to
programming and a degree starter code
now you can easily open this file and
check it out again if I forget any of
this content or if I just want a
reference to stuff that I've ridden
before</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
