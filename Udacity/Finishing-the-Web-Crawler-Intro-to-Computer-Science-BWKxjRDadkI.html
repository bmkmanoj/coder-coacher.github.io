crawler and remember what we want the
web crawler to do so we have a seed page
and we're assuming we know some seed
page to start with and the seed page has
some links on it we want to be able to
find those links and we know how to do
that now we're gonna get them a list and
then we're gonna follow those links so
we'll follow the links to new pages and
there's new new pages might also have
links and we want to follow those links
so in order to do this we need to think
about two things we need to keep track
of all the pages that we're waiting to
crawl and we'll introduce a variable to
crawl to do that and what to crawl will
be is a list of pages left to crawl so
initially it'll just be the seed page
once we collect the links on the seed
page well it will include those links as
well once we finish crawling a page we
don't want to keep it in to crawl
anymore and as we find new pages to
crawl they'll be added to the to crawl
list the other variable we want is to
keep track of all the pages that we've
crawled at the end of our crawl this is
the result we want to know all the pages
that we found that will be stored in the
variable will call crawled so let's walk
through an example of how this should
work on the sample site so what makes a
seed page wwe.com cs101 X slash index
dot HTML that's this page here that
means when we start to crawl we want to
crawl to be this index page and I'm
going to stop writing out the full URLs
just writing out the final part because
all the pages we crawl will be on our
test site so to crawl will be the list
containing just one element the indexed
own HTML page we haven't crawled
anything yet we're just getting started
so crawled will start out as the empty
list the next thing we're going to do is
crawl this page so we'll get all the
links on this page that means we've
crawled the index page so that will now
be added to crawl but when we looked at
the links on the index page we found
three new links on that page we found
the link here which goes to crawling dot
HTML we
the link here which goes to walking dot
HTML and we found the link here that
goes to flying dot HTML so the new value
of to crawl after crawling this page
will have those three links in it the
next thing we want to do is take one of
those links and crawl it the order
actually matters a lot in terms of
getting a good crawl let's assume for
now that we'll just do the last one
first so we'll do the link fly that
links to the flying page here's the page
there so we're gonna crawl the page
flying about HTML this page doesn't have
any links if you're not sure why
squeamish ossifrage is the magic words I
would encourage you to duck taco or
Google that and now we finish crawling
flying so that's going to be added to
the crawled list which already had
indexed on HTML we don't lose that we're
gonna add the new one which is flying to
that list and we finished crawling it so
we don't want to crawl it again let's
remove it from the to crawl list now
after we've crawled flying we have two
more links left in our to crawl list we
have two links that we've crawled so
let's try another link let's suppose we
follow the crawling in that HTML link
and we follow crawling we get to this
page so to follow crawling we're going
to follow the same algorithm we did with
fine
right so that removes this link from the
to crawl list adds it to the crawled
list so we're done crawling crawling and
now we want to add to our to crawl list
all the links that we find on this page
well we found the link kicking which
goes to the page kicking that HTML so
we're gonna add that to our list of
pages to crawl and now we keep going and
we're gonna keep going
we'll follow kicking we find that
kicking does not have any links so that
would add kicking to the crawled list
and remove it from the to crawl list and
we're gonna keep going until we have no
more pages to crawl so let me describe
that process a little more formally and
then I'll ask you a question about it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
