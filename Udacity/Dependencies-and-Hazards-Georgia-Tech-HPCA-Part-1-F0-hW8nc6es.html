between the dependencies we have seen
and what we hope hazards in a pipeline a
dependence is the property of the
program alone we can just check whether
two instructions have a dependence
between them without any regard to what
the pipeline looks like in a particular
pipeline some dependencies will cause
problems potentially and some
dependencies cannot cause problems no
matter what let's look at an example of
this let's say we have the classical
five stage pipeline with fetch decode
alien memory and write stages and let's
consider two instructions like this that
have an output dependence in this
particular pipeline I will show you that
this output dependence is never a
problem the ad will move through this
pipeline until the right stage and that
is when it will update r1 so let's look
at the cycle while the ad is here and
the multiply is following behind it at
this point the multiplication has been
fetched has been decoded and read r4 and
r5 it read the correct value because
these are not affected by the ad and now
just sitting in the main stage because
it's not a memory operation it has the
value that it will deposit in r1 when
the ad leaves the pipeline in the next
cycle the multiply will get here and
have each write of r1 so as you can see
these instructions always write to r1 in
the correct order so the fact that there
is this output dependence doesn't mean
that we have to worry about it in this
pipeline this dependence will be
naturally satisfied in this pipeline
because the writes by different
instructions are always occurring in
program order in this pipeline now let's
consider a write after read dependence
let's say that there is a subtract
instruction here that overrides r4 that
was read by the multiplying at the point
where multiplier is r4 the subtract is
being fetched so the multiply reads the
value of
our four that was not affected by the
subtract later on when the multiply is
done the subtract will finally write to
our four and that again means that the
fact that there is a dependence between
the read and the write in these
consecutive instructions is never a
problem for our pipeline because the
read of our four in the multiply occurs
many cycles before the subtract
overrides that value so again we have a
dependence that cannot become a problem
in our pipeline now let's look at what
happens when there is a true dependence
in this pipeline in this case our four
here should be used by the next
instruction the divide is reading our
four in a cycle where the subtract is
here clearly at that time subtract
didn't put it's our four value in the
register r4 it is actually just
computing that value so when the divide
reads register for it's reading a stable
value of our four that existed before
the subtract several cycles later when
the subtract is writing to that register
the divide has already computed its
value and the next cycle divided we'll
write that bogus value into the register
so pretty much the divide read the wrong
value for for computed with that wrong
value and then eventually deposits that
wrong value into a register so clearly
this true dependence here is a problem
in our pipeline if we just let things go
and flow through the pipeline we will
have the wrong result deposited into our
ten by the divide the situation when a
dependence can cause a problem in a
pipeline is called a hazard so a hazard
occurs when a dependence results in
incorrect execution of one or more
instructions hazards are a property of
both the program because you cannot have
a hazard unless you have a dependence
but also of the pipeline itself how the
dependence is interacting with the
pipeline so for example we have seen
that
output and anti dependencies in this
particular pipeline cannot become
hazards but true dependencies can now I
will show you that not all true
dependencies are hazards in this
pipeline in this case we have seen that
a dependence between consecutive
instructions creates a hazard in this
pipeline let's say that the right to r7
occurs in this multiply instruction and
that we now have an XOR that uses R 1
and R 7 let's now see whether there is a
dependence between the ad and XOR yes
there is R 1 produced by the ad should
be used by the XOR and there is also
dependence between the multiply and the
XOR but let's see if these dependencies
are hazards in this particular pipeline
when the XOR is in the decode stage the
divide is in the alias stage the
subtract is in the mem stage and the
multiply is in the right stage and the
ad has left the pipeline it was writing
to r1 in the previous cycle so as you
can see the dependence between the ad
and the XOR is not a hazard in this
pipeline pretty much in this pipeline if
there are three or more instructions
between the producing and the consuming
instruction then the consuming
instruction reads the register after the
producing one has already written it
however the dependence on r7 between the
multiply and XOR is potentially a
problem in this pipeline because the XOR
is reading r7 in the cycle during which
multiply is writing it to the register
so if this write completes near the end
of the clock cycle and this read is
happening near the beginning of the
clock cycle the XOR will not read the r7
produced by the multiply in this
pipeline we can tell that a true
dependence is not a hazard if there is
three or more instructions in between
the producing in the consuming
instruction but it is a hazard if there
is fewer than three instructions between
them in this case there are only two
instructions in betwee
and that's why we still have a hazard</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
