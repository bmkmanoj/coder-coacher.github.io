talk about something today Michael I
want to talk about Bayesian learning and
I've been inspired by our last
discussion on learning theory to think a
little bit more about what it is exactly
we're trying to do and the move beyond
specific algorithms to just think more
generally the sort that learning people
want us to do learning theory people
want us to do and I think Bayesian
learning is a nice place to start ok
sound fair yeah that sounds really cool
I think maybe that would be a nice kind
of formal framework for thinking about
some of these problems good good so I'm
gonna start out by making a few
assertions which I hope you will agree
with and if you agree with this then
we'll be able to kind of move forward
and ask some pretty cool questions okay
so Bayesian learning so the kind of ID
here behind Bayesian learning is this
sort of fundamental underlying
assumption about what we're trying to do
with machine learning so I've written it
down here here's what I'm going to claim
we're trying to do we are trying to
learn the best hypothesis that we can
given some data and some domain
knowledge do you buy that as an
assertion yeah it's and pretty much
everything we've talked about so far has
had a form kind of like that we're
searching through a hypothesis space and
as you've pointed out on multiple
occasions there's this kind of extra
domain knowledge that comes into play
for example when you pick a like a
similarity metric for something like K
nearest neighbors right and of course we
always have the data because we're
machine learning people and we always
have data so this is what we've been
trying to do and I'm going to suggest
that we can be a little bit more precise
about what we mean by best and I'm gonna
try to do that and see if you agree with
me okay so I'm going to rewrite what
I've written already
except I'm replacing best with most
probable okay so what I'm gonna claim is
that what we really been trying to do
what all these algorithms are doing is
we're trying to learn the most likely or
the most probable hypothesis given the
data and whatever domain knowledge we
bring to bear you buy that interesting
I'm not sure yet I mean so is it the
hypothesis that it's most likely to be
returned by the algorithm no it's the
hypothesis that we think is most likely
given the data that we've seen given the
training set and given whatever domain
knowledge we bring to be
problem the best hypothesis is the one
that is most likely that is most
probable or most most probably the
correct one interesting well we're gonna
be able to connect that to what we were
talking about before which is generally
we were selecting hypotheses based on
things like their error yes exactly we
are gonna be able to connect that we are
definitely gonna be able to connect that
but okay I can't go forward unless I can
convince you that it's reasonable to at
least start out thinking about best
being the same thing as most probable
yeah I'm willing to go forward with this
it sounds interesting so if you're
willing to move forward with this then I
want to write one more thing down and
then we can sort of dive into it
so if you buy that we're trying to learn
the most probable hypothesis the most
likely one the one that has the highest
chance of being correct given the data
and our domain knowledge then we can
write that down and math speak pretty
simply it's the probability of some
particular hypothesis H drawn from some
hypothesis class given some amount of
data which I'm just gonna refer to as D
from now on okay and that's just exactly
what we said just above when we talk
about the most probable age given the
data okay
well wait two things one is so d is not
distribution which we've had in the past
so I guess as long as we keep that
straight and the other one is no that's
you're just telling me the probability
of some particular hypothesis H that's
right
so we want to somehow given this
quantity we want to find the best or the
most likely of those hypotheses given us
does that make sense yes so we want to
find the Arg max of H drawn from your
hypothesis class that is we want to find
the hypotheses drawn from the hypothesis
class that has the highest probability
given the data perfect okay good so
we're gonna spend the next 45 hours
exploring this expression okay so that's
like what's like six hours per letter
yeah and that's fine because it's
important</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
