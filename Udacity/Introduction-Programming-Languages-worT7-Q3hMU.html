and JavaScript into tokens we'd
specified them by regular expressions
which are implemented by finite state
machines and this has always been one of
my favorite parts of programming
languages it actually sticks in my mind
when I was a student taking this in a
more traditional classroom the
instructor asked after talking about
regular expressions in lexing is there
anyone interested in doing a research
and this was actually my first step
towards becoming a professor but
actually I was doing really poorly in
the class at the time I was not a very
good student so I went to the
professor's office he said oh you know
show up if you want to do undergraduate
research I was there and when I came in
the door there was a second where I
could see in his eyes this you not you
but then he quickly you know sort of
changed to a more positive attitude I
continue to work with him and that began
my career pushing forth the boundaries
of human knowledge by studying
programming languages and to some degree
what I'd want you to take away from a
story like this is it's not necessary to
have mastered these concepts right at
the beginning or the first time you see
them what I really want is for you to
master these concepts by the end of the
course so don't feel too bad if the
original units have been giving you a
bit of difficulty they gave me a lot of
difficulty when I learned them the first
time so we finished up with regular
expressions and this time we're going to
move on to context-free grammars the
sentences of programming languages let's
get started</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
