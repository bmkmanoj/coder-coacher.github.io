technique regularization and
regularization is all about load
balancing load balancing is a problem
that's plagued parallel programming
since its inception now to illustrate
the idea of load imbalance let's go back
to our example for technique 5 where we
were bending the cities of the United
States if you look this map you'll
notice that the cities aren't spread out
evenly some grid cells are going to have
a lot of cities like up in this region
and some grid cells are going to have
relatively few cities so any threads
that are adding up the city population
to nearby cities in these cells they've
got a lot of work to do right they've
got lots of cities to look at in the
neighboring in the neighboring cells
that they can look at those cities and
compute distances so many threads that
are adding up the city population and
cells up here have a lot of work to do
they've got a lot of cities to compare
to while other threads that are in the
same warp or the same block you know
might be responsible for you know a city
in one of these grid cells and have a
lot less work to do and so it'll
complete quickly and sit around waiting
for these long running threads this is
an example a classic example of load
imbalance so regularization is all about
reorganizing the input data to reduce
load imbalance in other words you're
taking irregular parallelism and turning
it into regular parallelism for example
in the US cities example that we've been
looking at some bins might contain more
cities than the average bin so you can
imagine provisioning each bin to have a
fixed number of cities say five and then
have a special way of handling those
relatively few overflow cities for
example you might handle the cities or
grid cells that overflow on the CPU or
you might use a different kernel that
implements a different algorithm such as
sorting the cities by longitude or
latitude there's there's many ways that
you could do this computation that we
were trying to do with figuring out
which cds are within 50 or 300
kilometers of each other and now the
storage and the main kernel code gets a
lot simpler right every bin has five
slots each thread loops over exactly
five cities and the fact that you'll
occasionally waste a bit of compute
while one thread sits idle for a slot
because it only had three cities or four
cities and it's been is more than made
up for by the fact that you never have
an entire war for an entire thread block
or an entire colonel
all waiting on a single thread that has
127 cities to check or a thousand cities
to check you've regularize the problem</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
