statement of choosing the most valuable
one I think it's too hard a standard so
you just want to start a fire so if it
will burst into flames it's good now did
you hit the perfect place coulda if I
put it started the fire over here would
it burn faster and bigger maybe but I
started the fire so and so that means
how do I recognize a segment that's not
very inflammable so what does wet would
look like versus dry wood and I think a
couple of things with the target
customer the key issues are going to be
is this a target customer I understand
do I have access to them can I
communicate with them clearly and do
they have the kind of funding or money
necessary to participate with my offer
okay so if you say okay I got that okay
then we go to the compelling reason to
buy so and the key issue there is how
compelling is my compelling reason to
buy entrepreneurs have a compelling
reason to sell so we think all our
products should be bought and we think
the compelling reason to buy is I need
your money but that's not how a customer
thinks right
the customer is thinking no I'm gonna
participate in your in your offer
because of something I need not
something you need and so and then the
issue is it before if you're just doing
it for free and a lot of this stuff
initially starts for free then you can
you can kind of be a lot looser because
I'm giving you enough a few clicks of my
life most people are willing to donate a
few clicks in their life
the third ones then is gonna be does my
offer generally scratch the itch that I
said it would
and so it's they call it product market
fit does my product really really do
this I mean I know I wanted to say it
does I want them to buy it I've sort of
said all the right words but is that
really me is that really who we are and
and there you have to be brutally honest
with yourself a lot of times you hope it
will in the feet in the markets giving
you a message saying no no and you're
going yes yet no so yeah it's a big an
entrepreneur is a very funny state
because you need to have enough
confidence to hear a bunch of knows and
keep going but you can't be tone-deaf
right you have to learn and not just be
stubborn and so that that that's that's
a
bit of a touch and then the final one is
you know is my offer in this context
truly differentiated enough because when
you're starting out nobody knows who you
are so it's not like they're loyal to
you so you really do have to stand out
at the beginning or else the world would
go well why wouldn't I just go with one
of the other guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
