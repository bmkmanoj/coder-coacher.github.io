windmill has access to a thousand watts
of power but it loses 400 watts so that
means the usable amount of power is the
difference 600 watts what power is work
overtime and what's our time going to be
if we're looking for how many kilograms
of water we're going to move our time is
going to be one day and when you do at
the unit conversion you find out one day
is equal to 86,400 seconds we can solve
this equation for the total work this
one mill can do multiplying both sides
by 86,400 and we get a rather huge
number of 51 million eight hundred and
forty thousand joules so this is the
work that can be done in a single day
and this work is just equal to the mass
of water times G times H because we've
already shown that when we lift an
object and it doesn't matter if that
object is a stone or water by a high h
this is the work that we have to do well
we know G and we know H if we solve this
equation for EM we find that our
windmill can move a total of eight
hundred and sixty four thousand
kilograms of water per day now that we
know this number deciding on how many
windmills to build just depends on
figuring out how quickly water is
leaking it now we've made some
assumptions here and these are
assumptions that I encourage you to talk
about in the forums but for now I'd like
to say congratulations</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
