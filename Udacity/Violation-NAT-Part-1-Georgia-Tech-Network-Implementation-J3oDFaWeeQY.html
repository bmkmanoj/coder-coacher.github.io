end-to-end argument our home gateways
which often perform something called
network address translation now in a
home network we have many devices that
connect to the network but when we buy
service from our internet service
provider we're typically only given one
public IP address and yet we have a
whole variety of devices that we may
want to connect and the idea behind
network address translation is that we
can give each of these devices a private
IP address now there are designated
regions of the IP address space that are
for private IP addresses one of those is
192 168 0 dot 0 slash 16 and there are
others which you can go read about in
RFC 3130 now each one of these devices
in the home gets its own private IP
address the public internet on the other
hand sees a public IP address which
typically is the IP address provided by
the Internet service provider when
packets traverse the home router which
is often running a network address
translation process the source address
of every packet is rewritten to the
public IP address now when traffic comes
back to that public IP address the
network address translator needs to know
which device behind the NAT the traffic
should be sent to so it uses a mapping
of port numbers to identify which device
the returned traffic should be sent to
in the home network so the NAT or the
network address translator maintains a
table that says packets with the source
IP address of 192 168 1.51
and source port a thousand should be
rewritten to a source address of the
public IP address and a source port of 5
0 8 7 8 similarly packets with a source
IP address of 192 168 1.52 and source
port of a thousand should be rewritten
to the public IP address and a source
port of 5 0 8 7 9
then when traffic returns to the NAT to
one of these addresses then that knows
that it needs to rewrite the destination
address on the return traffic to the
appropriate destination IP address and
port that's in the private network
so for outbound traffic the NAT device
creates a table entry mapping the
computers local IP address and port
number to the public IP address and a
different port number and replaces the
sending computers non-routable
IP address with the Gateway or the NAT
public IP address it also replaces the
sender source port with a different
source port that allows it to
demultiplex
the packets sent to this return address
and port for inbound traffic to the home
network the NAT checks the destination
port on the packet and based on the port
it rewrites the destination IP address
and port to the private IP address in
the table before forwarding the traffic
to a local device in the home network</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
