talking about and here you have a
picture the overall view of the human
brain friend of mine Jeremy wolf always
said make sure you draw on the nose so
okay so your nose is over there your
eyeballs here and then they're all these
various structures the cerebellum in the
back here behind your head is for a lot
of rapid motor control kinds of things
take effect bunch whole bunch structures
all of this crank lee stuff up here is
the cortex and we'll talk about that a
little bit later by the way these little
things sticking out right here called
the olfactory bulbs those are the things
that actually go into your nasal cavity
that does sense of smell that's actually
a part of your brain that sticks out
into your into your nose and another
part of your brain that sticks out is
actually your retina and we'll talk
about that in a minute the parts of the
brain I want to talk about today are
it's this lesson of next of course are
the parts that are involved with the
human vision system and those are orally
drawn here on this schematic it's just
ugly but it's actually much clearer so
again here we have your two eyes okay
getting now your nose is up here and
you'll notice that out coming out of
each eye is what's referred to as the an
optic nerve and they sort of cross in
this funny way at what's referred to as
the appt the optic chiasm they then make
a way stop I make a stop here down in
here in a lateral geniculate and then
the lateral we'll talk about and the
lateral geniculate has projections up
into something called the superior
colliculus and the most of it a lot of
it goes to what's called the visual
cortex and we're going to talk about
that by the way we describe these things
as if it's a flow of information going
up and that's partially because as
computations we like to say well first
we do some low-level processing at that
the detectors and the retina and then it
goes up to these way stations where
various kinds of things happen and then
up for higher-level processing the
reality is somewhere between eighty and
ninety five percent of the projections
into for example the lateral geniculate
are actually from the cortex back down
so the engineers amongst you will say oh
that's got to be feedback of some sort
well indeed it probably is and it's
still stuff that we're just
slowly getting a handle on so take what
I'm about to say with a grain of salt in
fact well take everything I ever say
with a grain of salt but in particular
I'm only going to give you a relatively
simplistic view of what's going on in
the vision system it's also slightly
dated view because while I'm try to be
pretty current about certain computer
vision things there's a massive massive
field of neurophysiology and human
vision so I'm just going to give you
some of the highlights and it'll give
you a general overview and I encourage
you to read more as we go forward one
thing to say also before we continue
forward is sort of the anatomy and
physiology of the brain really reflect
the computational complexity of vision
so to give you an example you have
auditory nerves that come from your
cochlea that go into your brain and
those nerves there's two of them one for
each ear and those nerves have somewhere
around 30,000 nerve fibers in in that
bundle okay the optic nerve each one
coming out of here that has somewhere
around a million fibers okay 30,000 for
hearing a million for vision from each
likewise and we'll talk more about this
later we're going to talk about visual
cortex this area back here so far in
that you can again you know plus or
minus somewhere around thirty percent of
your cortex right the cortex being the
most recent part of the brain in terms
of evolutionary structures if we think
of it as being the sort of the human
element somewhere around thirty percent
of the visual of the cortex is seem to
have something to do with vision as
opposed to say three percent for hearing
and eight percent for all somatosensory
touch so again the complexity of vision
is not only showing up when you look at
your problem sets and how and you say
how could this possibly work but it is
also reflected in the detailed structure
of the human anatomy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
