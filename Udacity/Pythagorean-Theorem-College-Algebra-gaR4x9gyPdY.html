the Pythagorean theorem that the sum of
the squares of either of the shorter
sides of the triangle is equal to the
square of the hypotenuse so in the case
of this triangle that means we have 9
squared plus 12 squared equals something
squared we want to find out what C is
simplifying the left side of our
equation gives us 225 equals C squared
now it's really easy at this point to
think oh my gosh I found our answer but
remember or not looking for C squared
we're looking for just see on its own we
just want the length of this side not
its square so how do we handle this how
do I get rid of this exponent of 2 well
we need to talk a little bit but we're
about exponents so we can figure out how
to deal with this what we need to do is
to take the square root of both sides
you've probably worked with square roots
before and the power of the square root
is to transform in this case C squared
to just see it also changes 225 into 15
will elaborate on square roots in just a
