features that we have to implement or
some of the other functionality that the
trusted computing base must have we have
to have a complete mediation we have to
guarantee that there is no way to get to
a resource without going through the
trusted computing base okay or the
reference monitor that it implements we
have to have a trusted path remember
trusted path is needed because otherwise
what could happen while some malicious
program a trojan for example can spoof
the interface offer your trusted system
and the ultimate trusted system is your
trusted computing base so it could look
like the operating system and you may
think that the login is being no you
interacting with the OS a trusted path
allows you to guarantee that when you
think you're talking to the trusted to
the trusted computing base or the
operating system you indeed are talking
to that system which of course prevents
programs malicious programs in
particular keyloggers a quick example of
the trying to log your key key strokes
or keys that you press to figure out
your password or whatever it is so it
prevents these kind of programs from
tapping the path okay from keyboard will
you press your keys to the system where
this key places are captured this path
has to be trusted and result of that
trust is that malicious programs are not
going to be able to to gain access to it
and be able to tap and see the
information that is being sent over it
the next thing we have in terms of
function down with your features we
didn't talk about that a lot of our
focus has been on sort of the prevention
side the idea that you know
authentication make sure it's the right
person access controls as the right
person gets access to a resource that is
being requested the thing is that you
know no matter how hard we work at
prevention things could go wrong
somebody can steal your password for
example and they can log in as you if we
keep an audit log of what has happened
what objects have been accessed when by
whom well this sort of an audit log can
come in handy when some abuse or misuse
might actually take place so prevention
if it's not hundred percent then you
have to go to the tech
and having a log would help you with
that detection typically detection is
that for some definition of unusual you
see some unusual activity in the system
that potentially means you know attacker
has gained access to it and that unusual
use can be you know the analysis that
you do that detection is possible when
you have a record or log of what the
system did keep in mind that this will
only be useful if we actually look at
the log and you able to correctly assess
when there is an abuse okay so although
audit we not going to talk a great deal
about that here but the lampson one of
the pioneers who worked in insecurity
actually had this thing called the the
gold standard of security this was based
on the 3a use the authentication the
authorization and finally audit periodic
table symbol for gold is au so the 3a
you actually define the gold standard
for security and the third heir you
typically is add a function that system
so i said it's useful only if you look
at it but also it's only useful if
malicious programs are not able to
tamper with it okay so its integrity
obviously is going to be important</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
