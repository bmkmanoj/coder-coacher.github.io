following reason x3 is just as it is
there's not or not so what that means is
that if we take the path that signifies
x3 is set to true and we know that is
the path that goes like this then we
want to be able to visit this vertex
here by paying so to say just one extra
edge so that's exactly this one here if
we had not x3 here then this answer he
would have been correct so it seems like
this is actually a good idea to show
that any boolean formula can be
transformed into a graph such that the
shortest path between a and B tells us
whether the original boolean formula had
a satisfying assignment or not but of
course we haven't proved it yet and that
is why we will now have to go into gory
details in order to actually prove that
we can reduce SAT to shortest tour</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
