to try and test this out before we going
to test it out don't forget to click
activate I always forget to do that
especially on workflows and approvals
after activating you cannot add to
remove that's fine ok we are activated
set times so should i create a new set
time so you could create a new set time
or we could just use one of the ones we
already created ok submit for approval
sounds good alright so there we see it
so in the approval history we saw when
you submitted it for approval ok oh it's
assigned to and then they can come here
and approve reject or possibly reassign
it to someone else to approve it and
this is just visible to me because I
happen to be the approval they prefer as
well so depending on your security
settings you might not be able to see it
but honestly if you can see this record
anyone should be able to see where this
is at in the approval flow gotcha ok so
now I should have got a notification and
now I can improve it right right so
first look at the status interview it
moved into reveals ok it's pretty cool
so now I'm should go to home well you
can improve it right from here all right
here yep cool so you can leave some
comments with it do you approve this set
time I approve so you can see the
records still locked now that it's
confirmed you can unlock it whenever you
want very cool all right I don't want to
lock it all right be a secret lock it up
ok</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
