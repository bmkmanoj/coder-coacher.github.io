ensemble of learners we can build them
using the same learning algorithm but
train each learner on a different set of
the data this is what's called bootstrap
aggregating or bagging it was invented
by Bremen in the late 80s early 90s
here's how bagging works so what we do
is we create a number of subsets of the
data I've drawn little bags here to
represent bags of data and each one of
these is a subset of the original data
now how do we collect these well we do
it randomly so for this subset that
contains in prime values and our
original data set contains in different
instances we grab in prime of them at
random with replacement from this
original data so what with replacement
means is let's say we had say these
values we might grab this one and put it
in our bag we might randomly grab this
one and put it in our bag but each time
we grab randomly we randomly choose
across the whole collection of data so
we might choose this one again and put
it in the bag so this one and this one
are really the same one and they're
repeated twice and that's okay that's
what with replacement means so we create
all together M of these groups or bags
and each one of them contains in prime
different data instances chosen at
random with replacement let's note these
things so n is a number of training
instances in our original data and prime
is the number of instances that we put
in each bag and M is the number of bags
we almost always want in prime to be
less than n usually about 60% so each of
these bags has about 60% as many
training instances as our original data
that's just a rule of thumb now we use
each of these collections of data to
train a different model we have now M
different models each one train on a
little bit of different data and just
like when we have an ensemble of
different learning algorithms here we
have an ensemble of different models we
query in the same way we query each
model with the same X and we collect all
other outputs we take the Y output of
each model take their mean and boom
that's our Y for the ensemble now keep
in mind we can wrap this in a single API
just like that API you wrapped your
linreg learner in and your KNN learner</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
