examples of how you can improve the UX
of your app exactly that sign in and
check out buttons to replace forms are a
really good idea but I know that I've
actually ended up creating my own
sign-in and check out forms and I spent
a lot of time optimizing them yeah I've
done the same thing I've spent a lot of
time trying to design the perfect
sign-in form I tested it with users and
tried really hard to optimize it yeah so
the the solution that we presented them
to you are actually just band-aids
there's an underlying cause actually
there's there is an underlying problem
which results in us coming up with these
forms and really focusing on the forms
rather than focusing on the applications
themselves if your first instinct was to
optimize locally and not to just replace
sign-in and check out with one of these
solutions what was your thought process
were you thinking too detailed were you
thinking too high level were you not
thinking of the bigger picture were you
trying to reuse existing code or is it
something else or none of the above
check all it apply</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
