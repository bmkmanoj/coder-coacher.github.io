this is what this document looks like
inside the browser the similarity should
be pretty obvious you can see this is a
heading here inside the HTML and you can
see the same this is a heading here
inside the browser there's a lot here
but I don't want you to worry about
everything right now just pay attention
to what you see right here which is
coming inside these two tags that's a
body this thing right here with h1 this
is a heading and h1 is an HTML element
and this is a special kind of element
called an h1 element H stands for
heading and one means it's the biggest
that means that there are h2 h3 h4 tags
and so on and they're all smaller than
h1 specifically this part is called a
tag the part with the angle bracket h1
and then another angle bracket there are
many tags in HTML here's a P tag here
are some span tags and this is an image
tag each one of these represents a
different kind of element this P inside
this tag stands for paragraph this whole
thing is called a paragraph element
notice that this whole element has two
tags here and here and these tags are
slightly different there's an opening
tag and there is a closing tag and
notice the closing tag has this slash in
it between the opening and the closing
tag comes the content this content is
generally what people will see inside
the browser so here are a few different
elements notice that the text and both
tags is always the same and notice that
they all start with a less than sign
they all have some kind of text in here
indicating what type of element this is
and then every tag has a greater than
sign and just to point it out again
closing tags have a slash inside them
but otherwise they look the same and the
slash always comes right here after the
less than sign and then together
everything here represents an element
there are some elements
like images that are slightly different
notice that images do not have a closing
tag and that's okay it's a special one
that you'll learn more about later this
is a conceptual way of representing the
same element in this case the content
belongs to the paragraph the content in
a way is a child of the paragraph this
is going to be useful later don't worry
about it now but I just wanted to show
you because you'll be seeing more trees
like this for the time being I want you
to write your first HTML element</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
