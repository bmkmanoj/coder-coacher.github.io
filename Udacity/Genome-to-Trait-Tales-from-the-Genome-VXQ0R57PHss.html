cells and each cell has its own copy of
the human genome so what you're saying
that my body has trillions of my genome
not just one exactly your body is made
up of trillions of cells and because
each one has its own copy you've got
trillions of copies it's what makes
cells different they each read a
slightly different portion of the
instructions for example a skin cell as
a skin cell and not a stomach cell
because it's reading the skin chapter
parts and the stomach cell is a stomach
cell not a blood cell because it's
reading the stomach sell parts and the
blood cell is a blood cell because it
reads the blood cell parts you get the
idea so all of my different traits that
make me me you're saying it because my
cells are reading different parts of
this to make me me exactly these traits
and an organismal level at a whole body
level or because different cells make up
tissues the tissues are organized into
organs organs are organized into your
whole body and then we see a myriad of
traits it's crazy how the body works it
is pretty amazing so I think it's about
time we wrapped up this lesson pretty
soon so I want you to try answering one
really tough question I want you to tell
me in your own words what is the human
genome I want you to be clear succinct
but comprehensive pulling on the
information you've seen so far in the
exercises in this lesson use words like
chromosome base pair mitochondria
anything that you think you need to
answer that question and save your
answer because we're going to come back
to it in a future video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
