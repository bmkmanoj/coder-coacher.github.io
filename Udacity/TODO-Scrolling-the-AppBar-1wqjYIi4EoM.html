the things our design calls for is
scrolling of the app bar and to do this
scrolling we're going to make use of a
brand-new support library we've created
to help with material design the design
library this library contains tons of
stuff to help you implement material
patterns it supports all sorts of app
bar patterns including collapsing
toolbars with floating action buttons
collapsing toolbars with pinning app bar
scrolling with pinned lists parallax
scrolling with under scroll parallax
scrolling with collapsing app bars and
it's a lot more than just app bar
patterns it also supports things like
navigation views snack bars and floating
action buttons tab layouts with fixed
and scrolling tabs and material text
input with collapsing hint text these
tools and more open up the palette for
Android developers to easily implement
more material design and to do so in
consistent ways the key to how most of
this functionality is implemented is the
coordinator layout coordinator layout is
part of the design library it's basic
functionality is similar to frame layout
any views that are placed in a
coordinator layout overlap by default
you can use layout gravity to align the
views within the layout similar to
relative layout views can be positioned
based upon sibling views except in a
more limited way gravity can be applied
to position the view center up down left
or right with regards to the parent view
most interestingly coordinator layout
supports behavior classes that can alter
the layout when we use a snack bar and
we have a floating action button inside
of a coordinator layout the default
behavior for a floating action button
will check to see if there are any
overlapping snack bars and automatically
move the floating action button out of
the way at bar layout is a special kind
of linear layout that works with
coordinator layout to animate various
kinds of toolbar patterns during nested
scrolling with a sibling view each child
of app bar layout takes layout scroll
flags
the behavior when nested scrolling is
taking place and the sibling to the app
bar is given the app bar scrolling view
behavior to coordinate with the app bar
so this is how our app bar will scroll
off the screen when we scroll a
recyclerview we add the collapsing
toolbar layout to the mix for some of
those really fancy animations it allows
you some really complicated transition
and the best thing is you can create all
this complex behavior in XML layouts
without having to touch the code</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
