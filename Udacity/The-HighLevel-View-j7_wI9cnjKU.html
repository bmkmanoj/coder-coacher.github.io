is something we call the learning
objective now when I say learning
objective I may mean something different
or at least more specific than what
you're thinking now we'll get into the
specifics later but for now let me show
you the learning objective I created for
this lesson I'll give you a second to
reading now I've highlighted some of the
interesting words like schema learning
objective perspective and task will be
using these words a lot more throughout
this lesson and it's okay if you don't
know what i mean by all of them just yet
but this learning objective these two
sentences took me somewhere between six
and eight hours to come up with but I
consider it time well spent and in this
lesson I want to convince you that that
time really is valuable for setting the
high-level vision for your lesson
because building big things requires
planning if you want to build them well
good software is well designed good
novels are well outlined and good
courses are well planned and the
learning objective is just one way to
think about that planning so in order to
achieve this objective we're going to
take the following steps first we're
going to do a preparatory activity this
is meant to get you thinking about the
power of what we're going to refer to as
expert schemas next we're going to do a
reading in two parts and this is going
to be a substantial part of the lesson
but it's going to be an essential part
of the lesson as well so I really hope
that you do it in this reading will
learn more about how educators think
about the distinction between novices
and experts and in particular how they
organize their knowledge next we're
going to meet this thing called the
learning objective and we're going to
see how this learning objective helps us
frame or lessons in a way that builds
expert schemas after that we're going to
see some examples of learning objectives
and learn how to evaluate which learning
objectives are more or less effective
than others I said earlier that learning
objectives were a combination of a task
and a perspective shift so in this next
step we're going to brainstorm some
tasks that you'll have your students do
then we'll brainstorm what's called the
perspective shift that accompanies those
and I know this all sounds high level at
this point that's okay finally you'll
put
this all together to an effective
learning objective which would be the
seed for an excellent lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
