to start simplifying this expression is
to identify which terms are like terms
negative 5x squared is the only term
this expression that has an X to the
second power in it so it is not like
terms with anything else here however we
have 6 X and negative x at first sight
these might both seem related to the x
squared term but remember the power of
the term matters both of these terms
have X to the firsts remember there are
little invisible ones right when you
just have a variable on its own X is
just equal to X to the first anyway
these two terms are like terms so I'm
going to start to rewrite this
expression with the like terms next to
one another remember that the sign of
the term it belongs to the term itself
and moves along with it when we
rearrange the order then the two terms
that we haven't written yet are 14 and
negative 3 these are just numbers so
they are definitely like terms and will
keep them next to one another now that
we've identified which terms are like
terms it's time to combine those like
terms so negative 5x squared stays by
itself since we can't combine it with
anything else for the X to the first
terms we end up with a new coefficient
of 6-1 or five so plus 5 times the
variable which is X and then all we have
left to deal with all the numbers 14-3
is 11 so we add 11 to the end once
you've written down our final expression
we can check and make sure that none of
the terms in it are like terms of one
another that is we only have one term of
each type in the final expression this
is an x squared term this is an X to the
first term and this is a constant term
so there's nothing more that we can
combine that means we've reached the
final stage of our simplification
