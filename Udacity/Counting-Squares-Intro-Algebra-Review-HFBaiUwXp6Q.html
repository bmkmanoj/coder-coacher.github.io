horizontal and vertical lines I want you
to practice graphing your own and now I
can't have you draw on your computer
screen so we're going to try something
else I want you to get a sheet of graph
paper or you can print one out or make
your own and I'm going to give you the
equation for four lines and I'm going to
ask you to graph them now let's say the
four lines i gave you wind up looking
something like this you can see that
they enclose this rectangle here and in
that rectangle there are 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
9 10 11 12 squares these four lines
enclose a rectangle that has 12 squares
now i'm going to give you the equation
of four different lines and ask you to
graph those yourself and then count up
the number of squares inside those four
lines so what I want to know is how many
squares are inside the rectangle formed
by these four lines and the equations
are here and you can enter the number of
squares in this box now i really
recommend you get a sheet of graph paper
do this yourself and count up the
squares the practice is really useful</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
