talked about mosaicing before we talk
about panoramas about aligning images
and bring them together well instead of
just a small discrete set of images
suppose you actually have a video so
you're taking your camera and you're
panning it around what you might want to
do is make a single image okay and this
comes from a caller Ronnie's work of
where you can see where all the frames
are okay you can sort of see these this
jagged line each one being the edge of a
frame and you realize what happened is
that the camera was swept out this way
all right and I'm able to make this
single image alright and if I'm rotating
my camera about its axis I'm not
actually doing any translating the
reconstruction can be perfect because I
don't have any motion parallax and if
these things are planes I have to align
some points how many points does it take
it's a homography question that's right
even Meghan got four points for that and
in fact if I am moving but things are
really on a plane it's still four points
so there are other applications of
motion analysis you know segmenting
objects in space-time sometimes you can
get the three-dimensional structure if
you know how the points are moving you
know which point is which just like when
you saw the person you might want to
learn the dynamics of how something's
moved maybe you're doing physiology and
you're watching people moving and you
want to understand something about their
gait and the dynamics of their gait all
right
recognising events and activities you'd
like to be able to say what just
happened in the video so it's not just
object recognition it's action
recognition and finally you might just
want to process the video and understand
the motion to improve the quality so you
might do motion stabilization right so
that you've got this jerky camera and
you'd like to get a nice smooth video
out there are simple ways of doing that
and complicated ways in fact the
colleague of mine here Orphan ISA and a
former student of mine wear a Quattro
and some others did some work on
stabilizing video especially when you
have rolling shutters and cell phones
anyway these are all reasons for wanting
to process
motion</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
