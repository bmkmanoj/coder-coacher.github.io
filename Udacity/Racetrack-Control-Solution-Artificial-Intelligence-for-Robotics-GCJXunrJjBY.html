cases on the left side if I'm on the
left side of the race course as defined
that X is smaller to radius the my cross
leg error is defined by the distance to
the circle centered at various cameras -
the maze itself so this is going to be 0
if I'm exactly on the circle if I'm more
than three times over to the right side
I get a circle again looks like the one
before but now the center of the circle
is a little bit further to the right by
three times radius is two point one
radius the rest is identical to the line
over here so I'm subtracting the same
radius on the right side you can't quite
see it but it's there
interesting are the straightaways so if
my Y value is large I'm in the upper
part of the diagram in fact it's louder
than radius then my crosstrack error is
the y-coordinate times two times the
radius which is the height of the
racetrack if I'm down at the bottom it's
just the y axis but really important is
the minus sign because I'm moving in
opposite direction so for your code to
run this correctly you would have forgot
everything in this routine right so that
finishes my homework assignment
congratulations you were able to make a
car drive on a racetrack there is
actually quite a significant component
of making cars drive the PID control
methodology that you learned today and
the smoothing methodology are really
really essential not just in controlling
self-driving cars but in a great number
of other control setups thank you for
taking the class so far you learned a
lot already you know there were
localization about planning and control
and we almost done talking about how to
build a self-driving car</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
