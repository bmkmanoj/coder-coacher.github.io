androids started getting really serious
about coordinated motion the new scenes
and transitions API made it much easier
to define how UI elements should move
together let's take a look the scenes
and transitions API introduced a new
paradigm for animating objects in your
UI James gave you a glimpse into this
API but it actually lets you do a whole
lot more the API allows you to define
different states for your UI called
scenes there's actually two scenes in
this example here and also let you
define ways to transition between those
scenes coordinating several UI elements
at once so when you I elements appear
disappear move or otherwise change you
could easily define the animations to
use in this example you can see some of
those elements moving some elements
appearing and some disappearing pressing
the info or close button switches
between those two scenes the way this
works is you have two layouts which
describe the two scenes here's what they
look like they're pretty simple just
some linear layouts relative layouts
image views text views and buttons now
the magic happens here in the on click
handlers when you press the info button
we use this new transition manager class
to change from the current scene to the
other one as defined by the second
layout file if we don't specify anything
else Android will automatically figure
out some nice transitions for you moving
elements shared between the two scenes
fading new elements in and fading old
elements out but let's say we wanted to
customize the transition we could do
things like stagger the transition so
that not everything happens all at once
for that you could describe your custom
transitions in XML and pass them into
the transition manager like so and
here's an example of the custom
transition XML there are some
similarities with the animation XML we
talked about before but the primitives
you're working with like change bounds
and fade are a bit different as you can
see the animation capabilities in
Android have been evolving from basic
animation
is an early android too much Richard
capabilities an Ice Cream Sandwich jelly
bean and Kit Kat let's go to Nick who
will tell us about the new animation
capabilities in Android 5.0 lollipop</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
