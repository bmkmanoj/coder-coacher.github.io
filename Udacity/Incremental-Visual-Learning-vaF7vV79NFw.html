principal component analysis what we
want to do is we want to build a tracker
that's not just based upon a single
patch but sort of constantly update some
form of a model between me and you that
model is going to be a basis set so
we're going to keep changing the basis
set a little bit as them as the model
moves we want something two runs quickly
and can operate you the cameras moving
and of course the general challenge here
is we would like this thing to be able
to handle if the pose is changing so how
the thing is moving you know rotating
translating maybe parts of it get
occluded okay and we'll talk about how
to handle occlusion in just a bit you
have illumination change and you want to
avoid drift it is you don't want to
start attracting someone's face and all
of a sudden you realize you're just
checking the bottom half of the face and
then it just gets stuck on a file
cabinet right you want to stick to their
face so the paper that some of this is
pulled from is this incremental learning
for robust visual tracking and I'm just
using this I mean it's it's at this
point known well and also it gives you a
sense of how to use principal component
analysis which we just learned particle
filtering which you know in order to do
incremental tracking this doesn't really
belong in the recognition unit but since
we couldn't do it until you knew about
PCA here it is so here are the main
ideas all right first we are going to
use some form of a particle filter but
the particle are going to represent the
deformation the deformation may mean
just an affine that is six degrees of
freedom it could be similarity could
even be just translation but the idea is
that the particles are going to capture
how the geometry changes from frame to
frame the second main idea is that we're
going to use the subspace method that I
talked before about detection right so
the idea is we have some small set of
eigenvectors they can reproduce only
images that kind of look like something
that comes from this class and we're
going to use that subspace in order to
say aha that's a good example of the
thing I'm tracking because I can
reconstruct that image really well the
third thing which is kind of the new and
cool part is that we don't fix the
subspace we let it change incrementally
as we get new it so we we track this
image
track this object we bring in the new
image we might say oh maybe it's changed
a little bit let me change my subspace
just a little bit so by changing my
subspace a little bit I can track
changes in appearance but because it's
an entire subspace I don't get fooled by
a sort of a small variation that's just
local and time and I can sort of hang on
to the object you'll see an example of
that as we go forward</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
