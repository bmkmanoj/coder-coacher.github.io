tell me besides ancestry information
well one thing that I would like to go
and look at next is to see what your DNA
says about some of your traits okay so
where am I going to go to look at my
traits all right so go up to my results
menu and under there you'll see traits
and just click on the traits all right
so here's a long list of traits but as
an example what I'd like to focus on
first is the report on lactose
intolerance okay and here's a column
with stars and that the number of stars
there reflects how strong the science
behind the report is not not so much you
know your particular result but how if
the scientific literature is really
supportive of the connection between DNA
and and the trait okay scrolling down
that look at your scholars so there's
some background here on nitrous and
tolerance and then here are your results
it says I'm likely to be tolerant yes
due to lactase persistence and so you
have your homozygous for the a allele
okay that's the critical snv here and
you share that with your dad your dad
also has two copies of the a so this
means you got an A from your dad and a
from your mother and having two copies
there is is making it most likely
according to the scientific literature
that you are going to be tolerant of
lactose and able to continue to drink
milk as an adult I see and I noticed
here too that I'll be lactose tolerant
because I'm lactase persistent and it
looks like even if I have only one a
that I'm still lactase persistence so
can you tell us if the a allele promotes
lactase persistence even in the
heterozygous state is the a allele
dominant or recessive</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
