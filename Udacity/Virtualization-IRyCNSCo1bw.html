Lord talk about virtualization is it we
talk about cloud computing and
virtualization and things like that once
you sort of have these virtual resources
and implement them using whatever
underlying physical resources you have
so there is no end to what kind of
things you can do we said we have to go
through this translation and someone
mediates but that can be done at many
levels so I thought we'll talk a little
bit about virtualization in the context
of this you know security and protection
is our main interests here so we're not
talking about virtualization for psycho
virtualization but how does this concept
actually relate to isolation and relate
to protection of resources and securing
them against unauthorized access and
things like that so main motivation for
virtualization comes from the fact that
operating system is large and complex
and the different operating systems
different applications may require
different underlying operating system so
one user virtualization commercially is
actually to not be limited to just one
operating system and be able to run
multiple operating systems but we go as
I said before we're going to look at
value of this idea when it comes to
protection and security so remember one
other thing when you have a single
operating system supporting all your
applications is that if the operating
system is compromised then it's going to
impact all applications every
application that you have running in
that system is going to be affected by
this compromise of the operating system
because they all have this one
underlying common operating system our
picture was we have our are all our apps
then we have our operating system and
the hardware if something goes wrong
here of course all of this is is
affected</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
