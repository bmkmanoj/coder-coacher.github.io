oblivious transfer and in particular we
need what we'll call one out of two of
leaves transfer and what that means is
Alice can create two values X 0 and X 1
Bob will obtain one of those values but
Alice doesn't learn which one
Bob learned Bob can only obtain one of
the two values but Alice doesn't know
which one Bob obtained there are lots of
different protocols that provide this
the one I'm gonna describe was invented
by even gold-rich in limbo in 1985 it
builds on RSA encryption and we're gonna
look at it as we need to use it in the
garbled circuit protocol so our goal is
that Alice has two wire labels these
correspond to the inputs to some gate
and she wants to transfer one of them to
Bob without revealing the other one
we're gonna use Alice's public key we'll
assume that's known to Bob before the
protocol starts so our goal is to
transfer one of these two wire labels to
Bob the first step is to create two
random values these are separate from
the wire labels these are gonna be
transferred to Bob these have no meaning
they're just two random nonce is created
by alice depending on which wire label
Bob wants Bob has some input either 0 or
1
he's going to pick either the first
through the second of these so he's
gonna pick X B is it equal to either X 0
or X 1 depending on his value of B then
Bob will pick some random value our
Bob's gonna use this to blind the
response so he can't allow Alice to
learn whether you picked X 0 or X 1 that
would reveal his input what so what he's
gonna do instead is use this random
value to blind the response and so he'll
compute this new value which is the
value of x that he selected plus the
random value raised to the public
exponent mod n so we're gonna hide the
value of xB by adding a random value
raised to the e power to it that value
is what's sent back to Alice and Alice
is going to perform two different RSA
decryption x' so she knows the values
that she selected for X 0 and X 1 she's
going to subtract each of those from V
she'll decrypt it using her private key
and we'll call the first one K 0 that
was the one constructed using X 0 and
the second one K 1 that was the one
constructed using X 1
so the question is if be selected one is
its input so that means B has the value
for xB is equal to x1 what are the
values of k0 and k1 select the best
answer for each choice it could be
meaningless it could match x0 x1 or R</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
