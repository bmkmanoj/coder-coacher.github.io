lightning is a form of electricity but
this wasn't obvious in the 18th century
and if you were this green-haired person
here watching houses get struck by
lightning you probably think what is
this thing let's go back to the
professor to get some more context on
the situation before the explosion of
electrical studies in the 18th century
lightning was interpreted as an
explosion of sulfur so furious matter
coming from the from the earth but
people started to realize some analogies
between lightning and electricity
Benjamin Franklin was not the first to
think about the analogy it was already
present in science and for example a
French scientist he wrote down a list of
analogies between lightning and the
artificial electricity but it was
Benjamin Franklin to stress the analogy
one of the most evident effects you see
studying electricity are attractions and
repulsions and so there are interactions
between electrified bodies and there is
a quantity called electrical charge
which is one of the quantities involved
in the in the phenomenon the bigger the
charge the stronger defect in the same
conditions the analogy with gravity is
very clarifying so it looks like we have
our work cut out for us but with the
help of Benjamin Franklin it looks like
we may be able to answer this question
what is this lightning and we might even
be able to prevent it from hitting our
churches houses and other buildings now
if you've ever rubbed your feet on the
carpet and then touched your finger to
your friends you might have noticed a
little spark that spark is electricity
it was Franklin's idea that this spark
was the same as this giant spark in the
sky and that both were form of
electricity</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
