bunch of different families of graphs
and we found that for all these examples
the number of edges is like big theta
event so it grows linear with the number
of edges so you might wonder at this
point is that all there is in life is it
always the case that the number of edges
grows linearly with the number of nodes
and the answer of course is no let's
consider the complete graph also known
as a clique on n nodes and the complete
graph every node is connected to every
other node and you get very pretty star
patterns if you fill these in so in this
case we have five nodes and a total of
ten edges but this doesn't really tell
us anything about the growth rate just
tells us that in this one example well
it could be the number of edges is twice
the number of nodes we don't know we
need to generate a more comprehensive
formula in fact I'm going to say you
need to generate a more comprehensive
formula so in this question I'd like you
to actually work out the number of edges
in a complete graph on n nodes and the
way you should submit this to us is by
writing a function in Python that called
clique and it is given one value n which
is going to be an integer greater than
zero and it should calculate from that
the number of edges that will be created
if you fully connect all those nodes and
then just return that answer back so
that we can grade it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
