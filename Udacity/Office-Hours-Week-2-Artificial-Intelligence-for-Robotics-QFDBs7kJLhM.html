have smashed in here in myself and we're
gonna do this the same way we did last
time first we're gonna talk about some
content and then we're gonna go into
some applications referring mostly the
Kalman filters but also talking a little
bit about Stan Lee and jr. okay what's
the first question
first question both the content
questions actually have to do with
linear algebra so when we were talking
about this state transition matrix state
transition matrix F mm-hmm we have this
equation X prime equals F times X plus U
and you said that this U is the motion
but the motion seemed to be embedded in
this F matrix in that the velocity was
contained was taken from the state with
the F matrix so what exactly is going on
with you
so you allows you to apply a choice like
then we just said the the position is a
function of velocity that's describing
physics but it doesn't give you a choice
so when you want to insert a choice into
the system like for example you might
want to change accelerations and that
affects velocity infinite States that
choice is expressed for the vector U we
didn't really use it because you are
tracking things we didn't know how where
they're being actuated so we said you to
zero or no example but if you have
control over the system a try to track
and you can insert like a motion
yourself then you use the vector U okay
interesting and just one other piece of
intuition we're hoping to get is a lot
of the matrices we talked about they
either didn't have off diagonal elements
or we at least in initialize any off
diagonal elements so specifically in the
P the covariance matrix and the r matrix
can you give us some intuition about
what those off diagonal elements would
represent so we actually ran into an
example that they have often elements we
didn't initialize it but then the
velocity became correlated with the
position when we realized oh the faster
we moved the further we are to the right
that was expressed by an off diagonal
element and they turn into correlations
so the larger these elements are the
more two variables I should call it the
more knowledge what one variable causes
something what another variable okay
thank you so now let's get into some of
the applications that the students seem
especially interested in
specifically this our matrix where does
it come from how do we get it in real
life what are we doing with our sensors
right
so the noise matrices they express how
noisy your sensor is and at first
approximation you could say well it's
just measure how what the variation of
the measurement is and then plug it in
but because these filters very subtle
thing assume conditional independence
they assume that noise is independent
for one types of the next present
reality it isn't and it to be set by him
so to believe start with a very large
value and see and you look at the result
and if the result looks good to you you
leave it that way
unfortunately there's no good science
for it's a while back and together with
n doing I published a paper on how to
learn the noise matrix but I think was
way beyond this class okay and so you
mentioned that Stanley and jr. both used
laser and radar just each one offer
something unique or they basically both
just doing the same thing and either way
how many incorporate measurements from
two sources into our common filter so
these are two questions first of all
laser and radar at first approximation
with the same thing they measure how far
things are away radar also measures how
fast they're moving through the Doppler
effect but their characteristics are
very different they measure different
things as certain elements they can only
measure up a laser that's just by radar
in fact these are instant my a much
higher spatial resolution but even to
become becomes foggy the wavelength of
light tends not to be as good as as a
rate of everything so the sample
complimentary to incorporate both Bayes
rule allows you to incorporate sensor
measurements but after another so if you
have a laser in a radar you just
multiply both of them in and this was
fun okay the top-rated question actually
was about the programming use of
programming languages used in Stanley
and jr. was it Python is it something
else and had much less - honestly okay
at the time we started out with C but
then C++ became very popular most
popular and ended be the better choice
so almost all the quarters written in
C++ okay and how do you make the
decision when you're starting a project
this big is there debate there is always
debate the the beauty of
C++ is very efficient in execution and
when you use it right it you can it can
be very powerful if you don't abuse it
it's way too many things build in but
some of the things like the classes are
just really really good and then look
then you hire people and you work with
students and something like Java so they
got a quota Java and others like C++ and
it just - or Ruby on Rails and then we
just bring all the stuff together okay
and thinking of Stanley a junior what
were the major hardware and software
differences between the two vehicles so
Stanley had about six embedded
processors Junior had two pcs with quad
cores so there was a more integrated
system the biggest difference in the
half actually the sensors Stanley had
very very cheap and simple laser
rangefinders as the main sensor we did
have Raiders waiting you so much whereas
a junior had a much much greater sense
of sweet Junior could look at all
directions
we caught the surround sensing whereas
Stanley would only look straight ahead
okay
and so that thing we saw spinning on the
top of Stanley that was the laser so we
just saw spinning with some of Stanley
was a shilling dream that was a junior
okay you never saw anything else stand
out nothing spinning okay right in there
one spins because he looks in all
directions it was important for city
driving because what's behind you
actually Madison cities unless you drive
a dresser train there's no other traffic
you don't have to look back and that's a
good segue into the next question which
is what's the next big challenge we've
done deserts we've done urban driving
the next challenge is to take over our
cars basically get this technology into
every single car and make sure driving
is safe and every person has a special
button that says nice man little chef
robot and I want to just drive
automatically and then I just gonna get
home without having to pay attention and
finally how comfortable is it this is
this thing dragged these cars drive like
similar to the way you or I would drive
so when when we first started the dog
would always say the driving is
effective but not elegant and you would
get in the car you know exactly what I
mean so this year me would go like this
all the time it would make a little
noise and was pretty clear you were
inside a robot
and it was from the outside look really
great for this but SS things moved on if
you get into a Google car right now you
won't be able to distinguish from you
driver it's really rock solid it's
during this days like this when it turns
it confidently drags it around moves the
right direction and comes back it's
actually coming our way and to get from
what you said to where we are now is it
low-pass filtering what was the mean we
will have a classroom control and the
control techniques ended up to be very
sophisticated but also very very good
all the kind of motion of the steering
wheel are all related to inaccuracies
and they came from multiple sources some
adversity word processing our GPS they
are good enough yet in our map data some
of is the map resolution and if you have
a 10 15 centimeter grid cell and your
your estimate comes from one bits up to
the next or your particle filter times
lived around that might not look
dramatic on a screen but if you turn to
see a motion in your fuel goes by two
three four degrees
that's really bad you had a sensor that
tracks the angle of the steering wheel
and the spatial resolution was about the
degree that means you couldn't quite
know what the angle of stimulus we would
drive a little bit blind like up to a
degree and a degree of steering wheel
doesn't sound like much but it's
actually a lot and you can try this out
if you drive a car and if you move
identically you feel a noticeable effect
so you'd find out after my tour we
actually putting the stretchiness drag
it back and then all that stuff you kind
of fix okay so we'll learn about that
and I think you know five PID roars yeah
excellent I can't wait all right thanks
a lot all right take care</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
