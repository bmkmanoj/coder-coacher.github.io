functions in unit 2 but some people in
the forum still seemed a bit confused
don't worry this is understandable the
generator is an entirely new object and
it can be confusing in the next few
videos we're going to answer three
questions how do we use generators and I
think this is actually an easier
question to answer then the second what
is a generator expression / functions
last object and we'll also talk about
when and why do we use generators so
let's start with a problem we want to
compute the sum of the squares of the
integers from 1 to 1 million so that
would be 1 + 4 + 9 and I probably
shouldn't write all of these out so the
question is how would you do this and if
you came from cs101 your answer is
probably to start with a function and
maybe your function would have look
something like this where we make an
empty list append all of the squares to
that list and then return the sum of
that list then you would have called
your function with an argument of 1
million and you would have gotten your
answer first let me say this is a fine
solution it gets the job done but it has
some problems and so keeping in mind
that we just want to make this
calculation once what do you think is
the biggest problem with this solution
do you think it's messy and
unnecessarily clutters up the program do
you think it uses memory when it doesn't
really have to I think it runs too
slowly or do you think the code doesn't
work and you may have several problems
with this so it's somewhat subjective
just choose whatever you think is the
biggest problem</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
