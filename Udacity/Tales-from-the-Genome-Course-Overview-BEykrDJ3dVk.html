from tales from the genome dude I'm
trying to record something here oh I'm
sorry can I finish Monsieur I'm sure but
you realize that's water right yeah
can't drink milk hmm have you ever
wondered why some people can't drink
milk or maybe you've wondered how UV
rays from the Sun can actually cause
skin cancer unless you have mother
nature's natural sun block melanin or
maybe you've wondered why you and your
sibling don't look as much alike as you
think you should Udacity is teamed up
with the personal genetic services of 23
and me to bring you tales from the human
genome an adventure into the biology of
DNA identity and health in this course
we'll learn a lot about how populations
of people are connected by their genetic
code will dive deep into the biological
processes to learn how people have
different blood types we'll take a look
at traits and try to figure out how much
of them are controlled by our genes
versus our environment you'll learn all
of that and much much more so see you in
