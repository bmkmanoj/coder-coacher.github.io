interest it's time to get our hands
dirty with the data set so here's the
path that I followed to find the data
set I started on Google as I always do
when I Google for Enron emails the first
thing that pops up is the Enron email
data set you can see that it's a data
set that's is very famous many have gone
before us in studying this for many
different purposes it has its own
Wikipedia page it has a really
interesting article that I recommend you
read from the MIT Technology Review
about the many uses of this data set
throughout the years but the first link
is the data set itself let's follow that
link this takes us to a page from the
Carnegie Mellon CS Department it gives a
little bit of background on the data set
and then if we scroll down a little ways
we see this link right here this is the
actual link to the data set below that
is a little bit more information if you
click on this it's going to download a
tgz file which you can see I've already
downloaded down here if you do this on
your own it took me nearly half an hour
to download the whole data set so I
recommend that you start the download
and then walk away to do something else
once you have the data set you'll need
to unzip it so move it into the
directory where you want to work and
then you can run a command like this
there's no real magic here I just
googled how to unzip teach easy and
found a command like this again this
will take a few minutes when you're done
with that you'll get a directory called
Enron mail and then CD into mail der
here's the data set it's organized into
a number of directories each of which
belongs to a person you see that there's
so many here I can't even fit them all
on one page in fact you'll find that
there's over 150 people in this data set
each one is identified by their last
name and the first letter of their first
name so looking through on a very
superficial level I see Jeff Skilling
see if I can find Ken Lay looks like you
might be up here yep there's Ken Lay of
course a whole bunch of people I've
never heard of and remember my question
is how many of the persons of interest
do I have emails from do I have enough
persons of interest I have their emails
that I could start describing the
patterns in those emails using
supervised classification algorithms and
so the way that I answered this question
was again using some work by hand
basically
I took my list of persons of interest
and for each person on that list I just
looked for their name in this directory
let's go back to that remind ourselves
what it looked like you can see the
annotated list here you might have been
wondering what these letters were before
each of the names these were my notes
that I wrote to myself as to whether I
actually have the inbox of each of these
people so Ken Lay and Jeff Skilling we
already found but then it started to
become a little bit more difficult so
you can see there are many many people
that I have ends next to their name and
that means no I don't have for example
Scott Yeager if I go over to the dataset
I don't see a Yeager down here so Scott
Yeager is a person who I'd love to have
his inbox I'd love to have some emails
to and from him but I don't as it turns
out I don't have the email inboxes of a
lot of people so I'll be honest at this
point I was actually really discouraged
about the possibility of using this as a
project at all I think I counted
something like four or five people that
I had their inboxes and while that might
be a few hundred emails or something
like that there's really no chance that
with four examples of persons of
interest I could start to describe the
patterns of persons of interest as a
whole in the next video though I want to
give you a key insight that I had that
gave this project a second chance a
different way of trying to access the
email inboxes of the persons of interest</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
