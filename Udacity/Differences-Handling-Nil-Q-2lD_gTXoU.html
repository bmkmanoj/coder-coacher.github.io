in objective-c let's start with how they
handle nil as you know so I have to
treat snail values with a great deal of
care rapping anything that could have a
null value in an optional type
objective-c is much less concerned with
null values the language doesn't need
the concept of an optional because any
object can have an lvalue no problem
surprisingly in objective c you can
invoke a method on an ill pointer with
relatively little consequence watch
here's some code that represents a bike
messenger picking up a package here I'm
initializing a messenger and then he
picks up a package now let's press run
and since we've got a log statement here
we can look down here in the console and
see package contents top secret stuff
now watch what happens if i set the
value of the bike messenger spike to nil
first of all the compiler doesn't care
if this were Swift the code wouldn't
even compile and then when i run the
code it handles it like it was nothing
down here in the console we see package
contents no but there's no crash there's
no nullpointerexception like we get in
java now in this toy example the fact
that nothing happens when we invoke a
method on spike isn't such a big deal
but in general you don't want your
program doing nothing when it's supposed
to be doing something you may find
yourself frequently checking for nill
values even though they won't crash your
program per se objective sees relaxed
attitude toward null values also has
some implications for debugging which
we'll talk about more in the lesson on
interoperability between Swift and
objective-c</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
