first three projects that you will
worked on in the sense you're not going
to be developing anything right you are
only going to be optimizing the web page
that is already given to you um so
project for is where you actually get to
see how you know each of the events in
your web page starting from your
scripting events to painting them and
rendering them onto your website is
going to affect and how much time it
takes to load them and how it's going to
affect your whole like efficiency of
your face so the experience of your
users you know that feeling when you
scroll in a web page and it's just like
dragging or it's kind of slow and legs
it's a really unpleasant experience and
the best websites are those that feel
really smooth and are very usable so
this is part of that usability and
people's patience with high-speed
internet man we just expect things like
really tried and so optimization helps
you make it look like everything is is
much smoother and faster just by being
really efficient and organized
methodical with a way that we load our
page and the contents and render
everything in the proper order also
learn about caching for project for it's
important to know there are kind of two
major reference um the first major part
of project for is getting a good
PageSpeed score so you have n grok so if
you run your server on your own computer
you can then use n grok to tunnel that
so that then you'll get an actual URL
I'll watch on the Borg you can plug into
the insights or you can also use github
to make it tough to get one bio page and
Matt in if you don't want to run a
server on your own computer um and
there's lots of instructions and good
suggestions on PageSpeed insights to
tell you how to optimize your page and
you can also apply a lot of the a lot of
the things you learned about minimizing
critical rendering path and the course
so through a combination of following
suggestions on that page and we live in
the course you can reduce or yeah
increase your page score inside score to
above a 90 on both your mobile and
laptop version desktop version of your
page the second part of the project
involves really getting into JavaScript
I mean so once you minimize I once
you've done all the things that you
learned about of the course in order to
make your page run faster and sometimes
it's actually your Java split that slows
you down and so we've created some
canvas Pizzeria is a sort of fictitious
web page somebody wants to sell these
outlandish pizza is actually pretty
funny if you need the descriptions and
you're supposed to make that page faster
and in this in that case it's actually
the JavaScript so take all your great
javascript in skills that you learned in
oj s and apply them to that pizza web
page and see if you can optimize it
you're really looking at the Java code
try to speed it up we've given you just
try it first yourself but we've given
you a lot of hints to if you look at the
office hours and you find a lot of the
extra documentation we've created it
should point you in the right direction
it's a good exercise to just try it
yourself first and see what is
inefficient about the code and then if
you get stuck maybe look at more of the
documentation we've provided to sort of
get you to get you all the way I think
the next two parts of the rubric is just
on commons and documentation which is
also very very important bison not not
just within you nasa t but like not just
for your projects but as your interview
your leftover yeah you communicate with
people and it's so much easier when you
add comments right and may your make
your code readable so i think the next
three sections are the code quality unit
so in this project mostly or just
editing code that's been given you so
make sure that the parts where you do
edit it is it is readable aside the in
donations are
same or appropriate indentations as you
go through it add comments where you
make changes and then they read me we
want to know exactly how you want this
to work with your project that's right
if you are hosting a big onion have got
I oh we want to know the website and we
want to know anything else that you may
have done let me use google let us know
that you have used it yeah and just list
out the optimizations that you made
that's true yeah some of the students
actually it's not very necessary to list
out optimizations but why we stress on
it is because the main de geus file is
so long it's huge and we are only going
to check specific areas that need
optimization um which are the two fixes
that Cameron has already asked you guys
to work um so yes definitely we are
going to look to your main Jas and see
if you make changes to it but it would
help if we had a quick bullet in the
really saying hey this is the part in
this file that I got into work and
change it on um so you can refer to it
in main dot J's file but you can also
like add bullets in your read me that
would make things so much easier for us
and you know make us creating your
projects faster and you don't ignore
that give me part because I don't think
anybody over here it likes to date send
submissions back or align and only say
yeah it's very difficult to see that you
know you've performed optimization it's
great you use these build tools um it
looks perfect and we don't want to send
it back just because you're gonna
comment or read me because yeah and it's
a very important part of your word as a
programmer any any sort of field any
sort of programming language that you
use yes do not forget to comment or you
know on a documentation about your work
yeah and if you're not using github I oh
we do want to see instructions on how
you want us to post your website on the
internet and check it so I guess
students you
slan servers s1 come on in their project
so they have had several different
methods to actually you know most ever
by pages but do let us know what you
want mr.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
