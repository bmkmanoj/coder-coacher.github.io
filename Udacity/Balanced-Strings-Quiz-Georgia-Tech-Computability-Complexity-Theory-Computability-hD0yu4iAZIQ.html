we're given a binary string and we want
to accept if it has an equal number of
zeros and ones and reject otherwise this
is going to be an exercise but I'll
recommend a strategy that leads to a
relatively small number of states
starting from the initial configuration
we'll accept if the current symbol is
blank an empty string has an balanced
number of zeros and ones again because
this is an exercise we'll use the
character B instead of the square cup to
indicate blank and if the current symbol
isn't blank then we can replace it with
the blank now if that old symbol was a 1
then we move right until we encounter
the next one and we'll change it to an X
and in fact if we find a 0 we go hunting
for a 1 and if we find a 1 then we want
to go hunting for the matching 0 these
have the effect of cancelling each other
out essentially if we don't find a match
for whichever symbol we've found here
then we reject we found the blank that
means we reached the end of the string
if we did find a match however then we
need to rewind to the next blank that
would be the one that we overrode here
and change that to X to indicate though
we've crossed it off then we move right
past all the X's and then we're ready to
repeat either finding a 0 1 and then
hunting for its match let's consider the
sequence of tape values for the example
input 0 0 1 0 1 first we blank out the
first entry and then we go looking for a
1 to match that 0 once that is found we
rewind the tape and Mark off this blank
here and then we step forward until the
next X dot symbol that's a 0 so we cross
it off with a blank and then we go look
for a 1 to cancel it out and we find one
here then we rewind back to the blank
cross it out and then advance to the
next uncrossed character we find this 0
blank it out and then we go looking for
a 1 but we don't find one so we reject
this string is imbalance you may use
this strategy or one of your own to
construct a Turing machine that decides
this
good luck</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
