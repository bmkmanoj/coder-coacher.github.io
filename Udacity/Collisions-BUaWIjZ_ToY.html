elegant system there are times when a
hash function will spit out the same
hash value for two different inputs this
situation is termed a collision there
are two main ways to fix a collision the
first is to change the value in your
hash function or to change the hash
function completely so you have more
than enough slots to store all of your
potential values you can also keep your
original hash function but change the
structure of your array instead of
storing one hash value in each slot you
can store some type of list that
contains all values hashed at that spot
these lists are generally called buckets
in this context rather than storing one
value in each slot you can store
multiple values or a collection in each
bucket but are either of these
approaches actually helpful for the
first one you can maintain constant time
lookup but by using a bigger number in
your hash function you're going to
require a lot more space to store your
values also if you do this reactively
and change the value in your hash
function every time you have a collision
moving all of your data to a new array
is going to definitely increase the
complexity in terms of both size and
time with the bucket approach you still
need to iterate through some collection
though a shorter one every time you're
looking for something hash functions
have a constant lookup time in the
average case but because of the bucket
system you could end up storing every
value in one bucket and then you're
still essentially just iterating through
a list in that worst case this actually
turns into Big O of N when done well
hashing is really fast and can save you
a ton of time but all of these things
are very real concerns there's no one
perfect way to design a hash function
you need to consider all of these things
and build a system that makes the most
sense for your data in your limitations
often you'll have to choose between
making a hash function that spreads out
your values nicely but uses a lot of
space and one that uses less buckets but
might have to do some searching within
each bucket ideally you would have one
to three elements stored in each bucket
so you
can design a hash function with that in
mind you can also do something creative
like using a second hash function inside
of a large bucket to split up those
elements even more that would work
particularly well if you know you're
going to have well spread out data but
end up having a few really large buckets
hashing questions are popular because
there's often not a perfect solution
you're expected to talk about the
upsides and the downsides of whatever
approach you choose to use so just do
your best to optimize your hash function
and make sure you're communicating with
your interviewer well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
