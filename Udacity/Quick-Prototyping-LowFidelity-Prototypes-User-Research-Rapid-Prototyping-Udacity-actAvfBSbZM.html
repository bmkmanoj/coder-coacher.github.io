basic theory of prototyping you know
enough by now to know these things are
only useful if you actually build them
so let's get started on that the
fundamental idea behind prototypes is
that you're making the fastest version
of a thing that can get you the
information you need from the people you
need it from to that end it's useful to
think about what the fastest possible
prototyping method would be since that's
what you want for your first few
prototypes will be showing you two
options either which work for your own
app or our example app behind this
curtain is your best friend the tool
that will allow you to prototype and
pivot faster than any other tool get
ready yeah look at that sketching your
prototypes simply on paper is the single
best way to work on prototypes when
you're starting a project from scratch
and allows you to change course very
easily you can redo parts your designs
during user testing in order to clarify
things that are being called out as
confusing these paper prototypes are
going to be super low fidelity but they
will give you use enough of an idea of
your app that their feedback will tell
you if you're going in the right
direction there's one other method of
fast prototyping and it's behind this
other curtain prepare to be amazed yeah
that's a printer when you've gone
through the work of making mocks for an
app you can build a simple paper
prototype by printing out these mocks if
you have marks from the product design
course this wrap could be for you both
methods will work for us here and they
will both lead to great user feedback</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
