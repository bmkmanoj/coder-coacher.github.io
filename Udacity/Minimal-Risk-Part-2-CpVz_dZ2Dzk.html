notional plot this is a loss expected
loss right on the left hand side this is
the probability that it's a forgiven an
x times the loss of that it's a four and
I call it a nine over here this is the
probability that it's a nine but I
actually called it a four and the
decision boundary is where these values
are equal to one another and of course
what is hard about this well knowing
what the losses are that's easy okay you
just tell me right you tell me how
expensive is it for me to call a smart
person not so smart versus calling a not
so smart person smart will probably has
something to do with their stature ok so
my losses might be asymmetric or my
losses might be symmetric like I'm doing
zip codes right and if I call a4 a9 you
know it goes to California and it should
have gone what starts with for what zip
code start with for I have no idea I
don't know let's say forest Texas so if
i call it a 4 and it really was an i
supposed to go to California goes to
Texas if I call it a etc it goes say so
assuming that it's not any worse ending
up in Texas than it is burning up in
California which is a difficult
assumption I understand see there are
more people in California than our texts
so I have to so my loss of insulting
Texas is lower than my loss of insulting
cut then never mind ok getting back to
this so i know what my losses are the
thing that I don't know is the
probabilities right for a given X how do
I actually know what the probability is
that it's a four I have to somehow learn
that or know that so who's gonna help me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
