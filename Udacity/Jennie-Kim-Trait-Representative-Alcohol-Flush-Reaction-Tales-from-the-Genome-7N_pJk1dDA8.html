I experience alcohol flush reaction well
for those of us like me who have not
experienced the alcohol flush reaction
can you describe it for us basically I
get really warm and I turned bright red
whenever I drink alcohol I see Dad do
you is it associated with any feelings
of being sick um I get a little bit
queasy I don't tolerate alcohol very
well and I really can't drink more than
a couple of drinks at a time I see so
your tolerance then is maybe a little
bit lower than other people of your same
height and size exactly now is this
something that's common in your family
it is my dad also experienced alcohol
flush reaction and he really doesn't
drink as a result now when did you first
realize that you have this kind of
alcohol flush it's kind of a funny story
my mom was looking through my facebook
party pictures back when I was in
college and one day she just sort of a
she's looking through them look up at me
and said why is so sunburned and all
your pictures and that's when I realized
something what's up I see so it wasn't
actually even you know you notice
something about yourself as much as you
felt a certain way maybe you didn't have
anything to compare it to per se like
from a personal experience and your mom
sort of was like wow you look really red
yeah my mom didn't didn't understand
because she herself does not have
alcohol flush reaction I see now does
this mean that you have any personal
genetic information about yourself or
your family for this particular trade
yes we've all we've all used 23andme you
have and what was your report for the
aldh2 the aldehyde dehydrogenase enzyme
if i can remember correctly um my father
and i only have one working copy of that
gene i see so you're heterozygous yes so
wow so that means you uh well we don't
know who you inherited it from unless we
know is your mom you said your mom does
not have this I see so you know that you
inherited this from your dad definitely
for my dad Wow how does it make you feel
I don't know just empathetic guy yes oh
my god um do you consider this I guess a
good or a bad trade at all or a positive
or a negative thing well it's funny that
you ask that you know I think if you'd
asked me this in cough back in college I
would have said
definitely negative thing I wish I
didn't have it then I could you know I'm
champagne all the time and it would be
awesome but now I'm actually pretty
grateful for it first of all it's good i
think that it helps me be more aware of
the impact that alcohol has on my body
which is generally a good thing for my
health and well-being and second I
actually kind of like or at least
appreciate strangely enough how that
this this reaction is somewhat socially
embarrassing and awkward I actually
appreciate feeling bad about myself
sometimes because that's why I'm funny
your is an interesting point there you
know someone who experiences alcohol
flush reaction let's say someone
watching this class maybe is only just
discovering this for themselves is it it
an embarrassing feeling or like do
people ever like make fun of you for it
or well you know I think um back when I
started noticing it I was much more
self-conscious I like to think though
that really that people are too
self-involved to really notice other
people at least I am so I you know I
have become a lot more comfortable with
that and I also just don't care as much
um so obviously the disadvantages of
alcohol flush reaction or that you can
feel kind of bad you don't have that
high of a tolerance and there may be
some kind of awkward social stuff
occasionally are there any advantages
besides the ones you mentioned about
being more self-aware about yourself is
there any kind of other advantage too I
actually like the fact that it moderates
it forces me to moderate my drinking and
be pretty judicious about drinking I
always have to ask myself like is this
cocktail really worth it I have a saying
that I can either be drinking or I can
be cute but I can't be both the same
time so I'll often just choose to be
cute and you know just choose not to
partake in in alcohol at all and as I'm
getting older I kind of appreciate that
more to have that to have that choice
and I feel better you know in the
mornings then maybe some of my other
friends would
how do you think this particular trait
of alcohol flush is seen culturally and
socially by other people that even
outside your own personal experience how
do you think it's portrayed I actually
don't know um I've just never been on
the other side of it I imagine again
that is kind of like my mom people would
just ask like are you okay or are you
sunburned or what happened there um but
I don't know if people really really are
aware of it or you know know that much
about it it usually helps when you're
out drinking and getting this reaction
to other people around you are also
drinking so maybe that also contribute
to the fact that people are less aware
right
have you ever felt pressured to drink
even though you didn't want to
specifically for this reason no that's
just not my nature in general you know
and my my thinking is as far as i'll
call flush reaction is concerned it's
just it's kind of like singing show
tunes or getting sleepy it's just
something that happens naturally
whenever I drink if you have the chance
to change this trade about yourself
would you change it it's funny that you
asked you ask that I mean if you ask me
the same question 10 years ago when I
was still in college I would have said
yes definitely get rid of it now
champagne for everyone but today I
actually really appreciate it I mean
first of all I appreciate the fact that
it forces me to moderate my drinking and
to be more aware of the impact that
alcohol has in my body second of all I
appreciate the kind of embarrassing
effects that it has because you know it
forces me to be comfortable with being
uncomfortable and feeling awkward and
also I think it's important that alcohol
flush that you but I realize that this
this condition is completely under my
control you know if I don't drink
alcohol then I don't turn red you know I
just stay normal asian colored period
and that's a huge factor I think it
would be much for me it would be a lot
more difficult if this was something
that I had no control over so for
example like asthma attacks or seizures
or allergies or things that you know you
might not have control over the the
stimulus in the reaction to me that
would be a lot more debilitating so for
me this is not that big of a deal what
about um any kind of medication you know
for lactose intolerance and people who
actually whose bodies don't metabolize
lactose very easily they can actually
take a bioactive form of lactase which
allows them to digest dairy products is
there anything like that for alcohol
flush reaction that you know of there's
kind of this over-the-counter remedy
that a lot of like my asian peers and i
discovered it's just an over-the-counter
antacid or acid reducing pill which i
used to call the anti-asian pill and i
used to take that when i drink but later
I found out that research shows that
actually isn't good for you to suppress
your body's symptoms as it processes is
toxin so I stopped taking it
wow I did not know that so what advice
would you give to an individual who may
be watching this for the first time
maybe discovering that you know they
have alcohol flush reaction is there any
important advice you would give that
person well I tell this person let's
just call her twenty-one-year-old jenny
kim i tell her first of all you're gonna
need a good full cover foundation that
looks natural and also photographs well
for those nights out when you'll be
drinking Make Up For Ever makes a good
one number 173 it looks too dark in the
bottle but trust me that's your shade
and then second hoteler don't sweat it
don't worry about it you know just be
grateful that you aren't able to consume
that much alcohol in one sitting you
know use those calories for cheese fries
instead because I bonnie is not gonna
keep itself and finally I would tell 21
year old me that it's okay to feel
embarrassed because you know yeah it's
embarrassing to look like a cherry jolly
rancher next to your cute blonde friends
at the club nobody wants to do that but
you know what life is embarrassing life
is messy life is like your big red face
you know it's how you handle it that
matters and I can tell I could tell her
right now that you know while you're
cute blonde friends might stay perfect
they'll never be hilarious and also stay
away from Gauchos because that's not a
good look for anyone duly noted I think
that's good advice overall Ginny thanks
