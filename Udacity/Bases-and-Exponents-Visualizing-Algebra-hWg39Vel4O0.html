this would be the expanded form for the
first problem we have four twos and
three twos so all together I would have
to to the seventh I have 72 s multiplied
together the second problem is very
similar to this first problem instead of
having a 3 as our base we have an X we
have some unknown number so we have
three of those X's multiplied by two of
those X's so altogether we have five X's
multiplied or X to the fifth here's the
expanded form for the third expression
notice that I have X's and Y's so these
bases aren't the same and I can't
combine them I just have to list X to
the third and y to the fourth that's my
answer for the last problem this is the
expanded expression since I have a
product of factors i can rearrange the
factors to group the like terms together
for example these X's can be moved over
here and these wise can be moved to the
right we can do this because of the
community property of multiplication we
know 3 times 2 is the same as 2 times 3
if ever I have a bunch of factors i can
rearrange the order of those factors
will still wind up with the same number
now this is a little bit easier to see i
have x to the seventh and y to the
seventh so these are the most simplified
expressions with exponents</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
