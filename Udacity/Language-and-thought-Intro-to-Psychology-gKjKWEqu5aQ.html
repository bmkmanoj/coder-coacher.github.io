going to discuss is the idea of language
thought and culture together so what
happens when we learn our native
language and then we're exposed to
people who speak a different language we
be able to understand concepts that they
have in their language if we don't have
those in ours
well the Savior Whorf hypothesis states
that language creates thought as much as
thought creates language and the idea
here is that if we're speaking different
languages we don't have a common
foundation therefore it will be
difficult to communicate and translate
ideas from one language to the other
now the linguistic determination
hypothesis suggests that our language
actually determines our way of thinking
and our perceptions of the world
basically what they're saying is that if
we don't have a word for an idea or a
concept in our language it's not
possible to think about that idea or
that concept now one very interesting
example that seems to support this
hypothesis comes from a small tribe of
about 200 people who live in the Amazon
area of Brazil now these individuals
have no words for numbers that are
higher than two therefore it's almost
impossible for them to understand the
concepts of nine and ten and they even
have difficulty with an operation three
plus one now this is not because these
people are not intelligent it is because
they don't have words for numbers higher
than two now let's go back to Lauren for
a recap of this section on language</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
