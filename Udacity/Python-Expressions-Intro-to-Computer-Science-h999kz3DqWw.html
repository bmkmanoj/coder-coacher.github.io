than the English grammar or most natural
language grammars in English if we say
something non grammatical like me go to
the store another English speaker might
laugh at us but they can probably
understand what we meant in Python the
code must match the language grammar
exactly here we saw when we tried to
evaluate 2 plus without the extra
operand we got a syntax error that means
it's not grammatical if we said 2 plus 2
someone in English well they might be
able to figure out that that means the
same thing as 2 in Python it needs to
match the grammar exactly so now we're
going to look at the Python grammar for
arithmetic expressions we won't see the
entire Python grammar here but enough to
get an idea of why the expressions we've
seen we're valid and why the 2 plus is
not so first of all an expression is
something that has a value we're going
to start our grammar with the
non-terminal expression and we can make
an expression by combining two
expressions with an operator this is
sort of like the sentence rule we had
for English where we could make a
sentence by combining a subject a verb
and an object this is a lot more
interesting though because we have
expression both on the left side and the
right side this looks kind of circular
because we have other rules it's not
completely circular this is what's
called a recursive definition we'll talk
a lot more about that in a later class
in unit 6 we will but for now we're
going to see how we can use that to make
the Python grammar and to make a good
recursive definition we need at least
two rules we need one where we can keep
going using the same thing on the right
side as left side and we need one where
we can stop so another thing that an
expression can be is a number and this
is why we can make expressions like 1
plus 1 this expression will become a
number which we come 1 the operator will
become plus and the other expression
will become 1 so let's write a few more
rules to see how that works so we can
replace the operator with plus we can
also replace operator with times and
there's several more operators in Python
those are enough for now we just need
those two we can also make numbers and
the complete rule for making numbers is
sort of complicated
but let's assume we know what numbers
are we can make numbers any number of
digits there are different rules to make
all those numbers but we know what they
are so this looks like a very simple
grammar it's quite small but it can
express infinitely many things and the
reason for that is because we have
expression on both sides here that we
can replace an expression with a bigger
expression and keep going so here's an
example derivations we can start with
expression we can follow the rule
replacing that with expression operator
expression and then we can follow the
rules again we can replace the first
expression with a number and replace
that number with the actual number one
and we'll notice the actual numbers are
terminal so once we get to the number
one we're done there's no more
replacements to do we can replace the
operator with plus plus is also a
terminal and we can replace this
expression with the number and replace
that number with the number one so this
is how we got the expression 1+1 in the
Python grammar and that's why that was
valid we can do a lot more than this
though instead of replacing this
expression with the number we could
replace this expression with another
expression operator expression so we're
going to use the first role it's
replacing an expression with expression
operator expression here and I'm going
to start abbreviating so expr is an
abbreviation for expression op for
operator NEX PR but we're just using
this rule and now we could do the same
thing again replacing this expression
with a number and replacing that number
let's say with number two we could
replace this operator with the
multiplication operator and we can
replace this expression with a number or
you could replace it with an expression
operator expression let's do that and
build increasingly complicated
expressions this way we can keep doing
this we're not done until everything is
a terminal so let's say we skipped a few
steps here but this could be 3 plus 3 so
this is how we can build up complicated
expressions from very simple rules so
I'm going to add one more rule to our
Python grammar that'll be enough to
produce all the expressions that we've
used so far
and that rule that we need is for
parentheses and this is actually quite a
simple rule it just says we can make an
expression by taking any expression we
have and putting parentheses around it
so this is a pretty small grammar but
this is actually a grammar that's
powerful enough to produce all the
Python expressions we've seen so far as
well as infinitely many different
expressions we're not going to cover the
entire Python grammar this way but this
should give you an idea of the power of
writing a grammar this way so we're
going to have a quiz to see that
everyone understands the grammar so the
question is which of the following are
valid Python expressions that can be
produced starting from expression using
the grammar rules so here are the
choices there are five possibilities
check all the ones that are valid
expressions that can be produced from
this grammar starting from expression
you can try your answers in the Python
interpreter if you want but first see if
you can figure it out for yourself which
ones are valid</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
