would you call let's let's um let's
think about this bottom one first okay
so what would you call an approach to
reinforcement learning that what it does
is it builds a model and then plans with
it a planner well it's not a planner I
mean the planners inside of it the
overall system this sort of blue box
turns transitions into policies so it's
a kind of reinforcement learner yeah but
it's one that builds a model inside I
would call that you know what I call it
I call that model based learning or
model based planning actually it's
called model-based reinforcement
learning mmm so this is this is in fact
my you said reinforcement learning is
your favorite kind of learning model
based reinforcement learning is my
favorite kind of reinforcement learning
hmm but we're not going to get to talk
about it very much so I wanted to at
least have this slide to give people a
chance at least you know these are all
pieces that you could imagine doing
right this this piece you can think of
as being what we did and when we're
talking about supervised learning and
this piece is what you talked about last
time so you know you could build a model
based reinforcement learner that way and
let me feel alright how about this other
idea where where you start off with a
model and then you pretend you don't
have a model you pretend you're just in
a learning situation by turning that
model into into transitions just by
simulating them then the learner
interacts with the simulator and then
spits out a policy well I could come up
with one or two answers so i could try
to do pattern matching on the answer to
the second one and set that one's
model-based then this one's transition
based which is kind of cute or i could
say well one difference between at least
inside the kind of blue box is it sort
of a model-free reinforcement learning
because the learner doesn't ever get to
see the model this is true the learning
piece is model free but we're using
model for a model-free learner in
service of planning okay so i don't know
i don't have a goodness um like model
free planner or at RL based planner
maybe like I said I did I wasn't going
to grade it I just was kind of
interested to see what would you say hmm
well I'll I was pretty I feel pretty
good about the modeled a story 01 yeah
well this is the actual term that's used
in the field I'm I'm sure there are some
terms that are used here but nothing
nothing
very consistently what have I called it
the blue box planner you could call it
that and but I had I drawn it with a
black box if I'd have had a better name
mmm that would have been really cool
blacks black panerai like that okay but
but I want to point out that one of the
most successful applications of
reinforcement learning or list least
most celebrated was Jerry tessaro's
backgammon playing program which used
exactly this approach back emin is a
board game so we have a complete model
of it but we don't really know how to
plan and it's very complex very large
state space so what he did is he
actually used a simulator back admin to
generate transitions and then used a
reinforcement learning approach td2 to
create a policy for that so it was his
TD gammon system followed exactly this
this overall pattern yeah it was very
influential work and generated many
mildly embarrassing master's theses I
can only think of one yes I could think
that's not true i can think of two oh
really well which one you're thinking of
yours yes completely of mine I try not
to think about it the other one is
Justin Boyan who's a good friend and a
highly influential reinforcement
learning contributor and now googler who
his master's thesis was also at
basically another TD game and he did
backgammon with RL oh I didn't realize
that I actually like him I think he's
very cool so I'm sure that his was not
mildly embarrassing uh I mean and yeah
you know everybody's master's theses are
mildly embarrassing because you're
you're struggling to learn about how to
talk about research and so you're not
going to get it perfect yeah in my case
it was definitely a model-free the only
non embarrassing master's thesis that
I'm aware of Shannon's oh sure alright
well Shannon what was his master's
thesis it was information theory oh yeah
it's pretty impressive yeah Rob
shapira's master's thesis was pretty
cool I have noted the boosting guy he
did he did pom DP learning for his
master's thesis yeah with the diversity
representation I'm a terrible human
being meanwhile i mean it is true though
you look at someone like shannon and you
just think to yourself oh for his
master's thesis he did he invented
information theory you're like wow we
know what he did for his PhD thesis you
know any different
Jesus nobody knows nobody cares because
he basically it or he he had already
done information theories they're like
here fill out a piece of paper you can
pick up a PhD did something on a I I
can't remember what it was but it was it
was totally unimportant and nobody cares
about it but information theory yeah
thanks all right well yeah okay I think
she Perry's PhD was boosting oh thanks
Rob make us all look bad why don't you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
