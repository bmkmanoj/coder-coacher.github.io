going to use a technology called
templates templates generally refer to a
library as a template libraries a
library to build complicated strings and
by strings I really mean any string but
when you're developing web applications
most of the time we're referring to HTML
because those are the strings we
generate the vast majority of the time
and in this lesson and really for the
rest of this class I'm going to be using
a template library called Jinja - the
reason we're using this is because it's
built into Google App Engine and you
know there are many templating libraries
and they're all very very similar and
Jinja - while this course is the first
time I've been exposed to it was very
easy to learn for me because it is very
similar to other template libraries that
I've used so it should be very similar
to other template libraries that you
will probably find yourself using down
the road you can find more information
about ginger aunt ginger dot PACU org
POC o o dot org let's start integrating
this into the little toy app we've been
building and see how things look ok
first thing we do is update our app that
yeah Mel this is an app engine thing if
you want to include external libraries
you need to do this you get a libraries
line you give the library name and you
say what's your version to use you don't
need to fully understand this right now
to be honest I don't fully understand
this right now you can find more
information in the App Engine Docs if
you want to start concluding more
libraries next what we do is we add an
import statement to import Jinja at this
point I'm going to reload our web app
just to make sure this import statement
works which basically implies that the
apps the app that llamo update worked as
well so I give to this page and I hit
reload and it looks like it worked if
there was an error you know let's say I
type this incorrectly you know adding an
extra to this is something you might see
when you're doing this on your own and I
reload this page you'll get you know
you'll see blank or nothing and then if
I look at my terminal we can see an
error in my terminal know module name
Jinja - - so if you see this you know
make sure you updated your app that you
animal properly and make sure you typed
the the module name properly okay let's
get rid of that I'm gonna add a couple
lines to initialize Jinja these two
lines are basically where you're using
the OS library which is built in the
Python
Oh s-stop path that join just
concatenates to file names and I'm so
I'm concatenated this is basically the
directory that my current file is in and
then I'm adding the word templates to
this if we were to run this in the
Python terminal it would look something
like this
so here I'm in the Python terminal I
just want to I just want you to see
what's going on here because this is
very simple but if you've never done it
before it can be a little confusing and
you may so just understand everything
that's going on so far to say oh us that
path that join and run it with a string
like home and a string like Steve it
just concatenates the two together it
gets the slashes right you know you
could just say plus but it just makes
sure that everything adds up
so that's oh s that path that join this
this other part the OS dot path their
name returns the directory of the
current file that's actually not going
to work on the terminal because
underscore underscore file doesn't exist
but it exists when you're running a
program so this just basically says my
template directory will be the current
directory I'm in slash templates okay
next we instantiate what we're going to
call the Jinja environment Jinja end and
basically this is a new digit
environment and we're going to use a
file system loader using our template
dur which we just defined there and this
basically says when we render templates
Jinja is going to look for those
templates in this directory current
directory slash template nothing too
complicated there and you can just copy
these lines next I'm gonna add a couple
of functions to my handler class here I
had a two functions render stir and
render so the first function here is
called render stir and this basically
takes a file name and a bunch of extra
parameters this is the Python syntax for
basically extra parameters and we use
that Jinja environment that we created
earlier above and we call get template
and give it a file name this basically
calls this Jinja to load that file
create a Jinja template we stored in T
we've called T dot render passing in the
parameters that were passed in to this
function this would be more clear when
we actually use this as an example and
this just returns a string and then I
added this other render function which
I'll use all over the place which again
takes a template a bunch of extra
parameters and it just calls render stir
this other function but it also wraps it
in self dot right which is one that
actually sends it back to the bread
you'll actually see these three
functions and most of the examples most
of the homework solutions and stuff I
use in this class
I've just been copying them around and
in fact what's funny is actually just
interviewed a guy at Hipmunk who had
these three functions in his code and I
had asked him I was like where did you
get those those functions from and he
couldn't remember I was like yeah it's
from this Udacity course I taught it a
little while ago so anyway yeah these
are handy little things feel free to
copy them around it's just for rendering
basic templates and next what I'm going
to do is move some of this HTML out of
HTML and into a file so let's create a
new file and copy and let's copy this
code or this HTML into that file let's
get rid of this percent s for now I'm
going to save this file I'm gonna call
it shopping list dot HTML and I'm gonna
store it in this template structure that
I just created ok and now as you can see
since we're using this editor sublime
and it knows it's HTML it actually
started syntax highlighting things for
us and we can also clean up our
indentation here without too much drama
so it looks a little bit better you know
so I still don't have any of the HTML
scaffolding around this you know the
head and the body and the actual HTML
tag that's because it's not really
needed for this example and we'll add it
in later it's generally a good form to
do so but there's no reason to make you
guys watch me type that over and over
again</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
