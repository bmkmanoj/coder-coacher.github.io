the forum now in reading all of this
code we've seen a lot of new words let's
review all of them so here I have both
of my programming files on the screen at
the same time here's my first
programming file where I'm making the
class movie and the second one where I'm
defining instances of that class
instances like Toy Story and avatar now
you may have to go into full-screen mode
to be able to read all of the details on
the screen
okay let's start reviewing all of the
new words so we started out by defining
a class the class keyword allows us to
make classes you can think of a class as
a blueprint and a class can have both
data and methods now we can create
multiple instances of a class in this
case we created instances like Toy Story
and avatar we could have created many
more now when we create an instance of a
class instance like Toy Story the
class's constructor gets called this is
essentially the init method inside the
class it is here that we initialize all
of the data associated with the instance
the constructor uses the keyword self
now you can think of self as itself or
the instance in question so when the
instance Toy Story is getting created
self is Toy Story all of the variables
associated with a specific instance are
called instance variables now these are
unique to an object and can be accessed
using the self keyword inside the class
and the instance name outside the class
and finally all of the functions inside
the class that are associated with an
instance and have the first argument as
self are called instance methods so
there you have it all of the new words
that we have learned thus far right
there on one screen</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
