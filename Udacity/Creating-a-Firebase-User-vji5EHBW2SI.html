and password provider why don't you
change the Android code to allow your
users to be created I've said you the
login screens I've been working on and
they're in a package called login we
plan to support two types of login that
we're going to use for the app email and
password and Google sign-in I'll give
you a moment to look at them we've got
two new activities here first is the
login activity which supports both email
password and Google login and second
we've got the create account activity
this creates new users with the email
password login provider now I haven't
added any of the firebase authentication
capabilities yet so what I'd like you to
do is start by adding the code for
making a new account in the create
account activity after all we can't log
anybody in if they're not created here's
some code that I copied over from the
firebase documentation it's basically
showing you how to use this create user
method to make a new user with the email
password provider to start you get ahold
of a firebase reference then on that
reference you call create user passing
in both the email and password that you
want to associate taking a quick look at
the create account activity I've made to
edit texts for you that have this
information that you need the name up
here is not something that create user
takes we'll discuss how to incorporate
that data in a bit the third parameter
is something known as a result handler
the result handlers have two methods on
success and on-air and these get called
depending on whether the new user you're
trying to create let's say one cool-dude
at gmail.com is successfully added as a
new user if JP successfully adds himself
the code in on success is called if you
used value result handler like I'm doing
right here when onsuccess gets called
you get an extra little map of
information that contains additional
login information for a new user and
just a quick note when you're creating a
user you actually don't log them in you
have to call a separate method to do
that now in shopping lists plus plus is
login flow we don't even want to log
them in when they're on this page we
have a completely separate activity the
login activity and that's where we log
our users in now that's pretty much
everything you need to know about on
success the other method in your result
handler is of course the onerror method
and this gets called if anything happens
and the count is not successfully
created so why might jp's account not be
successfully added well there's actually
a full error listing on the firebase
documentation which provides some
insight into what could go wrong for
example there could already be an
account using that email or the user
could have typed some
that isn't perceived as a valid email to
be able to know which of these errors
occurred you'll need to use the firebase
error parameter which will match one of
these errors given here that's the
argument shown right here and once
you've figured out what error occurred
let's say one cool dude was already
taken you might want to give a helpful
message to the user in some way okay so
can you take this more generic code here
and put it in our app so that when the
user types in their email and their
password it actually makes a new user
for them you'll know you're successful
when you can go to the firebase
dashboard and see your new account so
I'm here on the user login to an
authentication page and if I scroll down
in this area here you'll see when new
accounts get created but don't worry
about actually signing in these new
users that's going to be our next step</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
