code over here
the first thing to do is to start using
something called a V audio engine now
this library is packaged within the AV
foundation framework and what it does is
that it allows us to manipulate audio so
as step one in our code what we are
going to do is create an object of av
audio engine once we have done that we
will create an instance on an object of
something called a V audio player node
you can think of this as the thing that
is connected to our mp3 file and will
actually play the recorded sound okay
let's create an object of this once we
have done that I will attach this to the
AV audio engine let me do that now like
that in the next step we will create
something called a V audio unit time
pitch this is the class that actually
allows us to change the pitch of our
audio so let's do that next
and then I will attach this to AV audio
engine also like that then towards the
end I will connect these two nodes
together there and then finally I will
connect AV audio unit time pitch to some
sort of an output like the speakers let
me do that
there once all of this is done we can
play the audio oh by the way based on
the value of the pitch and this effect
the recorded voice will sound like a
chipmunk</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
