debugging within Eclipse I created a new
file called add numbers which I'm
showing here it takes two numbers parses
them into integers as them and print the
sum
supposedly of the two numbers now we
look at the run configuration for this
program and here you can see that we're
passing two arguments two and five to
the program so now let's run our program
and see what happens and the result says
that 2 plus 5 is equal to 10 which is
not exactly correct so we need to debug
our problem we need to figure out what's
wrong with the problem why the wrong
result was produced so we're going to
add a breakpoint here by double clicking
here on the side of the code and the
breakpoint is basically a place where
I'm telling my debugger to stop during
the execution because I want to inspect
the state of the program so to start
debugging we select debug as java
application from the context menu
similarly to what we were doing for
running the program and as you can see
this asks us whether we want to pass to
the debug perspective which is a
perspective specifically designed for
debugging we said yes and if you see
here it shows us a you know a slightly
different set of views so we can see the
code down here with an indication of
where the execution is and of course the
execution stopped at the breakpoint
which is exactly where we told the
debugger to stop so let's look at some
of the other views in this perspective
the view here on the right-hand side for
example shows the variables in scope and
the breakpoint that are currently active
for the debugging session this is where
the editor is the outline of the program
and the console at the bottom so now
let's execute one line by clicking on
the step-over button here at the top and
this will execute the line of this
currently alighted and therefore it will
move to the next line and as you can see
one nice feature is that if I move the
mouse over a variable I can see the
value of the variable and the same thing
I can do if I look at the variables
windows here on the right if I click it
it will tell me what is the value of the
variable and in case of more complex
variables you can even expand it and get
more details
so now let's step over another line by
clicking again this button and as you
can see now we get to the line that
actually performing the some supposedly
so now let's do the same thing that we
did before and let's mouse over B and we
can see that the value B is 5 as
expected
so now let's step over this line as well
and execute the actual sum and doing the
mouse over thing we can see that the
value of sum is 10 which is not right of
course in fact if we check again we can
see that the value of a is 2 the value
of B is 5 and therefore it's clear that
there's something wrong going on here
and at this point we can not either here
we're doing multiplication instead of
addition and therefore that's what the
error is and this is clearly a very
simple case right of case in which
probably you just needed to look at the
code and you didn't need a debugger but
you probably got the idea right so this
can be extremely useful when you're
debugging when you're studying more
complex programs if you want to stop the
debugger because you're done with your
debugging session as in this case you
can either click here on the terminate
button or you can also just simply tell
the debugger to continue the execution
to resume the execution until the
program terminates naturally so in this
case we're gonna actually here just to
show what happens and what happens is
that you know the execution will just
continue until the program exits so now
let's say that we want to fix this
problem that we just discovered so we
replace that the multiplication with an
addition we save the program and we
execute the program again by clicking on
this button and at this point
unsurprisingly we get the right result
as shown in the console</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
