undecidability and the importance of
saying whether problem is undecidable is
that well every computer is actually
finite it has a finite amount of state
it can run for a finite length of time
and therefore we can determine whether a
program halts or not simply by letting
it run either until it terminates or it
arrives at a state where it has already
been and by state I mean the memory in
the computer is exactly the same and we
are executing the same line of code as
we were the previous time around because
if both of those things are true well
we're going to loop back around again
and have the same memory in line of code
executing and again and again so then
we'll know if it will terminate or not
one of the problems with this is that
well today's computers have a whole lot
of memory so why don't we try it with
something a little bit smaller so let's
try it with a smaller computer a
computer that only has a single kilobyte
of total memory now this is a
ridiculously small amount of memory for
this day and age it's really kind of a
joke you can't even fit the Udacity logo
in this amount of memory now remember a
kilobyte is a thousand bytes and a bite
has eight bits in it which can each be
set to either 0 or 1 now let's say that
this computer can take 10 billion steps
in a single second now what I'd like to
know is if we did this and we wanted to
know if a program that we were running
on this computer would terminate how
many years could it potentially take us
to decide if our given program
terminates I'd like your answer in the
exponent for 10 to the however many
numbers of years and if you'd like a
little bit of a hint the age of the
universe is estimated at about 14
billion or 10 to the 10th years your
answer should be substantially larger
than that so go ahead and enter the
exponent in here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
