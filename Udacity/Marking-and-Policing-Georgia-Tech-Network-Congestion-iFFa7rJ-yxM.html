compete for bandwidth consider a voice
over IP application and a file transfer
application that want to share a common
network link in this case we'd like the
audio packets to receive priority over
the file transfer packets since the
users experience can be significantly
degraded by lost or delayed audio
packets in this case we want to mark the
audio packets as they arrived at the
router so that they receive a higher
priority than the file transfer packets
you might imagine implementing this with
priority queues where the VoIP packets
were put in one queue and the file
transfer packets are put in a separate
queue that is served less often than the
high priority queue an alternative is to
allocate fixed bandwidth per application
but the problem with this alternative is
that it can result in inefficiency if
one of the flows doesn't fully utilize
its fixed allocation so the idea in
addition to marking and policing is to
apply scheduling one way of applying
scheduling is to use what's called
weighted fair queuing whereby the queue
with the green packets is served more
often than the queue with the red
packets another alternative is to use
admission control whereby an application
declares its needs in advance and the
network may block the applications
traffic if the application can't satisfy
the needs a busy signal on a telephone
network is an example of admission
control but can you imagine how annoying
it would be if you attempt it to load a
webpage and were blocked this blocking
or the user experience that results from
it is a negative consequence of
admission control and it's one of the
reasons it's not commonly applied for
internet applications</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
