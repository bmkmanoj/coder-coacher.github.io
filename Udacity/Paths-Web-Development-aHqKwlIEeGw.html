the final / because you know it's
technically a different URL and how what
the best way to handle that is okay
ending URLs and / I honestly I don't
know the correct answer I don't I
usually make my websites not care so
you've seen them in my URL mapping I
have a regular expression that looks
like this / blog / ? and what this
basically says is this will map the URL
/ blog and it'll also match it if it has
the trailing slash which I think it's
the most friendly way to do it because
some browsers will automatically add the
slash users will add the slash it's just
they have a way of creeping up and you
don't want to have like slash blog work
and have / 4 or 4 or vice versa because
you just make a lot of people angsty so
I usually just make it optional now you
can do this thing sometimes and I've
been working on this online jaan a on
the final project where the URLs are
going to be a little bit more dynamic I
usually have a regular expression that
looks something like this / + or it's
like thought thought thought / + or
double slashes there's something like
that basically I detect the situation
where URL ends in a bunch of slashes and
then i have this go to some handler that
automatically redirects to a single
slash version or redirects to a 0 /
version depending on your website that's
kind of handy in the question that
somebody asked they basically proposed
you know should i do it this way or
should I have a redirect way the answer
is depends on the web app you know do
whatever feels right but it's a great
question to ask because it is something
you should think about you should try to
make both versions work you know it
could be the case that you know / blog
is the blog and / is you know got more
content you know if that's kind of a
hierarchical view of your website that's
fine but you know think about it and
it's pretty easy you don't generally
just add a question mark and forget
about it so I hope that helps</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
