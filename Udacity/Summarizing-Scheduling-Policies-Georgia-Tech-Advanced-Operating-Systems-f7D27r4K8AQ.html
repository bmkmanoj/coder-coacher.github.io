I already mentioned that first come
first serve simply ignores affinity and
pays attention only the fairness and
these next two policies that I
introduced to you fixed process at a
last processor the focus is on cache
affinity of a thread with respect to a
particular processor that's what we're
focusing on in fixed processors with the
last processor the next two policies
they focus are not only cache affinity
but also cash pollution in particular it
asks the question how polluted as the
cache going to be by the time TI gets to
run on the processor that's the question
we are asking in both minimum
intervening as well as minimum
intervening plus queuing in terms of
making a scheduling decision and I
should be clear from the discussion up
until now the amount of information that
the scheduler has to keep grows as you
grow go down this list the order of
arrival is all that you care about you
put them in in priority order in the
queue and you're done with it and you
have the scheduler has to do a little
bit more work in each one of these cases
and correspondingly the amount of
information that the schedule has to
keep for every one of these scheduling
policies is going to be more but the
result of the scheduling decision is
likely to be better when you have more
information to make the scheduling
decision another way to think about
these scheduling policies is that the
fixed processor in the last processor is
thread centric in saying what is the
best decision for a particular thread
with respect to its execution whereas
this MI and the minimum intervening plus
QE both of these are processes centric
saying that what thread should a
particular processor choose in order to
maximize the chance that the amount of
cache contents is going to be relevant
for the currently scheduled threat so
that's what we're looking at now that
I've introduced to you these different
scheduling policies it's time for a quiz</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
