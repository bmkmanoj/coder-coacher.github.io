we're talking about philosophy a little
bit and these insights come from the
Danish design researcher PN and he is
relating the process of software design
to the thinking of four important
philosophers so the first philosophers
Descartes and we think about Descartes
with analytic geometry and this may
translate for us into the thinking about
the analysis phase of software design on
the other hand Marx was very concerned
with social processes in classes and
understanding the social context of
design maybe even involving the users in
the design process Martin Heidegger was
concerned among other things with tools
and of course tools play a big role in
the automation of our development
process and tools like ITES interactive
development environments and case tools
computer-aided software engineering
tools of course play a big role and
finally my favorite is Vidkun Steen the
Austrian philosopher who came up with
the concept of language games and what
this means is the inventing of a
vocabulary that helps you think about a
particular problem for example think
about the introduction of personal
computers and the role that thinking the
role of the terminology of the desktop
folders trash baskets and so on play in
doing that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
