select the main dot storyboard file this
is your storyboard the place where you
will set up your entire user interface
here you will eventually see the entire
interface all of the interface elements
and the view controllers associated with
the interfaces you can see this app only
has one interface and one view
controller named view controller a
couple of key things to notice the first
is the light gray arrow on the left side
of this view this signifies that this is
the initial view controller for the
storyboard and in fact for the
application when the user starts this
app this is the first view controller
and view that will load on the bottom
right side you can see the library
selector with different types of user
interface elements we can drag in if you
don't see the library make sure this
third icon from the left is selected the
one that looks like two concentric
circles you can hide the debug area as
well as a navigator panel to give us
some more screen real estate as I've
done here before we can drag a button in
this view needs to be at a hundred
percent zoomed in double click on the
header here to do that let's start by
dragging in a button to this user
interface element on the bottom right
scroll and select the button or search
for it by typing UI button drag the
button to the center of the screen using
the two blue bar guidelines to Center it
horizontally and vertically now we come
into the first problem most beginning
iOS developers face the background of
this button is white the UI view behind
it is also white if you click away how
can you tell how big the button is one
trick that I use is to temporarily
change the background of the button so
you can easily see how big it is and
where it is on the view cells are great
chance for you to play around a little
bit with the attributes inspector with
the button selected here on the left
click on the attributes inspector and
scroll down until you see background
select the drop down and pick a color
I've chosen bright green color for the
background of this button the more
visible the better you're not going for
aesthetics just yet
now we can see our button is pretty
small and we can easily see what would
happen if we resize it double click on
the button and change the text to record
go ahead and grab the button and drag it
out so you can see the entire ward being
displayed while we're at it here's
another tip if you had a hard time
selecting the button you can use the
document allied view in interface
builder part of Xcode to find the UI
button and select it that's this view
here on the left you can hide and show
the document outline by clicking on this
button here on the bottom left the next
step is to set up the layout for the
button and for that we've got to talk
briefly about auto layout</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
