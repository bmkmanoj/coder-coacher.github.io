useful and you should always use one if
you can possibly find one we're going to
have a bunch of examples here so let's
start off with one of the important ones
which is having an alternate
implementation of the same specification
if you think about it this is what my
random tester for the bounded queue did
and perhaps what yours also did and what
I mean by that is my cue tester included
a second implementation of the same q
abstraction this one was implemented
with a Python list and this was the
second implementation of the same
abstraction we could use it to actually
check with the queue that we're testing
gave the right answers so that's a very
strong kind of a check another example
that we use in my compiler testing work
we do what's called differential testing
of compilers what that basically means
is that if we have multiple
implementations of the same compiler
specification that is to say for example
multiple C compilers we expect them to
behave the same given equivalent inputs
another way that we might get an
alternate implementation visibly looking
at an older version of the software that
we're testing this is checking not
necessarily whether the software is
correct but just rather rather whether
we broken it let's remember for example
that I said that in cell probably could
have tested the Pentium floating-point
unit against a 47 floating-point unit
another kind of old version Oracle that
tends to be extremely effective is after
a refactoring change that is to say a
change of our source code base that
isn't intended to have any functional
effect we can use the versions before
and after refactoring we can do
differential testing of the version
before and after refactoring and in that
and in that way try to get a pretty good
idea that the refactoring didn't
actually break the code the best kind of
alternate implementations you have is a
reference implementation that is to say
some sort of implementation of the
specification that you're after that you
can trust for example if I wanted to
implement and extremely high performance
Python compiler what I would do is I
would use the regular C Python
implementation as the reference
implementation and that would be treated
as correct</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
