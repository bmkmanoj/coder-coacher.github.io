quite similar
you're still visiting every edge and
marking off every node however here you
search every edge of one node before
continuing on through the graph again we
start with the first node and mark it as
seen then visit a node adjacent to it
once we mark that node we can add it to
a queue remember the difference between
a queue and a stack like we used for DFS
for a queue will remove the first
element we put in it but for a stack we
removed the most recently added element
we go back to that first node and visit
everything adjacent to it marking each
is seen and adding them to a queue when
we've run out of edges we can just DQ a
node from the queue and use that as
their next starting place we look at
every node adjacent to that one adding
each one to the stack until we've
exhausted our options it's important to
note that when we DQ we're getting a
node adjacent to the one that we started
with you can kind of envision a BFS as
creating a tree out of a graph the node
that we started with becomes the root
the group of adjacent nodes is the next
level in the tree we need to continue
adding nodes one level at a time we
finish off one level entirely before
moving on to the next and soon we're
done with our BFS the efficiency is
still the number of edges plus the
number of vertices again we're visiting
every edge and vertex during our
traversal</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
