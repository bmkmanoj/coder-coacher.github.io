that is to observe that 15 is 3 times 5
it's a composite number that can be
broken down into two primes and then if
we look at the numbers from 1 to 14 so
these are all the positive integers less
than n we want to figure out how many of
these are relatively prime
so the multiples of 3 are not can cross
all those out and that's true for the
multiples of 5 as well the multiples of
5 are not and that leaves us with 8
numbers this works in general so if we
know that n is the product of two primes
well then we could compute the totient
of n it's the number of integers less
than n which is also P Q minus 1 that
would be all the integers then we want
to subtract out all the multiples of P
that are less than n and since n is PQ
well there are Q minus 1 of those and
then we want to subtract all the
multiples of Q less than n which is
again PQ so there P minus 1 of those if
we do the algebra we get PQ minus P plus
Q plus 1 which we can also write as P
minus 1 times Q minus 1 and since P and
Q are prime and this property depended
on P and Q being prime otherwise some of
these multiples might have collided
since they're prime we know they didn't
and that means that we know that the
totient of n is equal to this notion of
P times the toshin of Q this is going to
turn out very useful for RSA and the
reason for that is if we know the
factors of n we have an easy way to
compute the value of the totient of n
but if we don't know the values of P and
Q it appears to be hard to compute the
value of the totient of P times Q that's
the crux of what the security of RSA
relies on and we'll talk more about that
later for now we're still focused on
correctness</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
