pasted both the account s ID and the
authorization token into my program now
the next thing I want to change is the
body of the text message I will change
it to something I actually want to send
which is my name is Ron Burgundy with a
question mark now for this to number the
comments in the code suggests that I
have to replace it with my phone number
so I'm going to select and change this
to my phone number with my country code
this by the way is also the number I
registered with Twilio previously then
they say that the Fromme number I have
to replace it with my Twilio number now
I remember that Twilio actually gave me
a phone number but I didn't quite save
it so if I go back to my accounts page
and click on numbers I can get my phone
number from Twilio all right back to the
code and now I can change that number
along with the country code next I will
save and run my program and this is the
phone where I'm going to receive the
text message so I'm just gonna give my
program a few seconds oh there it is
there's my text message let me read it
you probably can't read it but it says
my name is Ron Burgundy all right this
just blows my mind that a few lines of
code like this can help us send a text
message okay so now that this code has
worked let's figure out what's actually
going on with this code</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
