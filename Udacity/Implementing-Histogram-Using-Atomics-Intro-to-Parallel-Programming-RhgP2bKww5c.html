simplest method recall that the reason
that a trivial parallelization didn't
work was that the read-modify-write
operation that we needed to increment a
bin was actually three separate
operations a global memory read a local
increment in a register and a global
memory right what if we could make this
read-modify-write operation here
actually be one operation instead of
three if it was only one operation it
could not be interrupted by another
thread now we call such an operation
atomic and as we learned last unit
modern GPUs support atomic operations to
memory what the GPU does in essence is
locks down a particular memory location
during the read-modify-write process so
that no other thread can access it this
is a simple change in the code so we're
only going to change one line in the
code here's our naive histogram here's
this new histogram that we're doing and
you notice we're only going to change
the last line we're changing this simple
increment here to an atomic increment
it's a simple change but let's see the
effect so now we're gonna run the
histogram program using simple histo
instead of naive histo and let's see
when we do that we get the expected 4096
elements per bin great news now the
disadvantage of this technique is that
it's serializes access to any particular
bin during the atomic operation many
threads might want to update that bin
but only one thread at a time actually
gets to do so and so the others have to
wait this contention for the atomic will
likely be the performance limiter in any
histogram code so let's say you have a
million measurements with which you'd
like to calculate a histogram you can
choose to have 10 bins 100 bins or 1000
bins in your histogram if you use the
atomic method which will most likely run
fastest</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
