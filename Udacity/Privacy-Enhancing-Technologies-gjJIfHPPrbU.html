technologies that can help enhance
privacy or improve privacy so here we're
going to talk about a few of those so
one of the threats we talked about was
traffic analysis okay you know who is
talking to who okay so we set the
communication who I want to talk to or
if Alice is talking to Bob somebody else
should be able to figure that out and
and they could do that with traffic
analysis what machine is talking to what
other machine from source and
destination information so what if we
don't want somebody to be able to infer
that so this we can do with this
technological tour and we'll see what
exactly it does but it's basically sort
of anonymous communication is what we're
trying to get to here
let's say what's happening here is let's
say Alice is maybe interacting with the
website but it doesn't want the website
to know that it's really Alice or
doesn't even want to know with this
website to know that let's say this Bob
site is so this website is operated by
Bob so Alice doesn't want Bob's server
to know that the request is coming from
her or even the IP address from which
it's coming so one way you can do that
is Alice has a client at work line so
that picks a random path the bunch of
tour nodes that you need to find some
subset of those and it constructs this
path in such a way that any node here
sort of knows about its predecessor and
its immediate successor but doesn't know
who the this request has come through in
in the past or accept its immediate
successor who's the next node that's
going to get it so this guy is told
saying well just send it to the next
node and the rest of the information is
or the node after that that information
is encrypted with this Nords key so this
guy would have no idea that once it
sends the message here it's going to go
to this one once it comes here then it
decrypts that you know the next
destination finds out and it doesn't
know who it's going to go after that so
it doesn't have the full picture either
so basically we
create this anonymous communication or
implement anonymous communication ads
toward us by using this is kind of a
scheme where a set of nodes actually
forward the message repeatedly and make
use of encryption to sort of know who
the message is coming from and where
it's going and that's all they know
about they don't know the full path and
as a result traffic analysis no one is
going to be able to figure out that
Alice is visiting Bob's website unless
they have control of all these nodes
which the likelihood of that would be
less</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
