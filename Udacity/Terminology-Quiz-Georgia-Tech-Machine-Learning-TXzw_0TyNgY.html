practice this concept of what a version
space is let's go through an example so
here we go here's the top the actual
target concept see and for all possible
it's a mapping from two input bits to an
output bit and the two inputs x1 and x2
can take on all four possible different
values that the outputs are 0 1 1 0
which is to say the xor function ok so
that's what we're trying to learn ok but
the training data that we have only has
a couple examples in it it says well one
training example says if the inputs are
0 and 0 the output is 0 and if the
inputs are 1 and 0 the output is 1 and
ultimately we're gonna ask questions
like well what happens if the input is 1
and 1 what's the output now since we
know that it's XOR we know that the
answer is 0 but that's kind of using
information unfairly so here's what
we're gonna do here's a set of
hypothesis set these are a set of
functions that says well the output
could be just copy x1 negate x1 copy X
to negate x2 ignore the inputs and
return true ignore the inputs and return
false take the or of the inputs take the
end of the input to take the XOR of the
inputs and then return whether or not
the inputs are equal to each other and
what I'd like you to do is some of these
are in the version space and some of
them are not for this training set that
I marked here so can you can you check
off which ones are in the version space
I think I can awesome let's do it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
