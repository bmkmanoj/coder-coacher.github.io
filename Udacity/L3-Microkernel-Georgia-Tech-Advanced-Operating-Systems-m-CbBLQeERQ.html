performance loss and microkernel based
operating system structure is the
potential for performance loss
what l3 microkernel does is by proof of
construction they show that they can
debunk the myths about microkernel based
operating system structure now l3
microkernel being a microkernel
has minimal set of abstractions has
address space threads inter-process
communication and a service for
providing unique IDs for subsystems that
live on top of the microkernel exact
details of these mechanisms provided by
l3 microkernel is not that critical but
the important thing is the microkernel
provides the minimal set of abstractions
as we've been always talking about
namely address space threads inter
process communication and UID and l3
argues that these are fundamental
abstractions that any subsystem that
lives on top of the microkernel or any
subsystem that you want to implement in
a general purpose operating system
requires these facilities and therefore
l3 argues that microkernel should
provide this as the minimal set of
abstractions how they actually provide
it may differ from one microkernel to
the other but the important takeaway is
that this is the minimal set of
abstractions that a microkernel should
provide now let's talk about these
system services now as I mentioned in
the previous slide the assistant
services have to be distinct protection
domains protected from one another and
protected from the applications that
live on top of the operating system and
of course we have this hard line between
the applications and the server's
providing these services and the
microkernel this is the structure of a
microkernel based operating system so
what is different about l3 microkernel
the key distinction is
that each of these services of the
operating system they have to be in
their own protection domain not
necessarily distinct Hardware address
spaces the point l3 establishes by proof
of construction is that there are ways
to construct a microkernel based
operating system providing these
services efficiently knowing the
features of the hardware platform in
other words l3 is argument is it's all
about efficient implementation of the
microkernel and not the principle of a
microkernel based operating system
structure so to fully understand how l3
microkernel goes about systematically
debunking the myths about microkernel
based operating system structure we have
to understand the strikes against the
microkernel</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
