love we touched on this briefly in the
lesson on language and thought when
Susan described what our emotional
feelings were termed remember she was
trying to tell Sofia that she was just
anxious or nervous about flying when in
fact Sofia's stomach was bothering her
and she was becoming physically sick and
in that lesson Susan asked what is love
and how do we describe it one
psychologist by the name of Sternberg
developed the triangular theory of love
he had an idea that love was composed of
three components they are intimacy
passion and commitment in various
combinations of these three components
explain all forms of human love so let's
take a closer look at these in a little
more detail intimacy refers to feeling
close connected and bonded in your
loving relationships next we have
passion passion refers to the drive that
leads to physical attraction romance and
sexual experiences and this is
accompanied by the physiological changes
in arousal and finally we have
commitment with commitment we're talking
about both the decision to love someone
and the decision to commit to love for
the long term so four different types of
love these three different components
are present but they're present in
different amounts for example with
romantic love we see high levels of
intimacy and passion below levels of
commitment and then here we see
companionate love which are high levels
of intimacy and commitment but low
levels of passion and here we see
fatuous love where there's high levels
of commitment and passion below levels
of intimacy now if you were to just have
passion and no intimacy or commitment
you see something like lust or
infatuation and if you just had intimacy
but no commitment or passion
it would just be liking someone and if
you just have commitment but no intimacy
and no passion this would be empty love
now if all of these types of love were
present in equal proportions
Sternberg would call this consummate
love so as I said any given relationship
can have a combination of these three
components
some of your lifelong friends you're
going to feel commitment with an
intimacy but not passion or your
siblings and family members would be a
mixture of intimacy and commitment
whereas your romantic partners would be
intimacy and passion and for those who
have all three in the same person this
would be a lifelong partner for example
a husband or wife or life partner</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
