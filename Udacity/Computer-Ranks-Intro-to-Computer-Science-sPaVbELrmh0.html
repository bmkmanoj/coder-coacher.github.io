code and then we'll leave a crucial part
of it for you to do as a quiz you should
feel free at any point to stop and try
to figure out more of the code on your
own there are lots of different ways to
do this and we'll show you one and
you'll finish that as a quiz so the
first thing we're going to do is define
two constants so we're going to use D as
the damping factor and I'll use 0.8 as
my damping factor that's the probability
thinking about our random web surfer
that she selects a link on the current
page rather than starting over with a
new random page the other constant I'm
gonna define here will call num loops
that's the number of times we're gonna
go through the relaxation what we're
computing is the value of rank at some
time step the number of times we go
through that is going to determine the
accuracy of our ranks we'll use 10 as
the number of loops you can experiment
with changing that and one of the
questions in the homework assignment
will ask you to think about what happens
when you change that so now we need to
start we said initially the rank of each
URL is 1 divided by the number of pages
and so the dictionary ranks we want to
initialize with those values so we're
going to create an empty dictionary
we'll call it ranks the number of pages
the number of pages we can get from the
graph the graph is a dictionary of nodes
and Len of graph will tell us the number
of entries in that dictionary so that's
the number of nodes in the graph which
is the number of pages that we crawled
and now we want to go through the pages
initializing each page to the value 1 /
n pages and I'm remembering to use 1.0
here to make sure the division is done
as floating point division and we get an
accurate number rather than integer
division so now we've initialized the
ranks we have a dictionary that map's
each page to its current rank which is 1
divided by the number of pages so now we
get to the interesting part we need a
loop that's going to go through the
number of times of num loops each time
through this loop what we want to do is
update the new ranks based on this
formula using the old ranks and then at
the end of the loop we're gonna make the
variable ranks hold what
previously new ranks and that way we can
keep going each time we're going to get
a new value for new ranks at the end of
doing all the updates we're gonna update
ranks to refer to whatever new ranks did
so that means each time through this
loop we're gonna create a new dictionary
called new ranks that starts as empty
and we're gonna add all the pages to new
ranks as we update their rank so to do
that we need to go through the pages in
the graph and for each page what we want
to do is compute the new rank for that
page and the first thing we'll do is
this part the new rank is one minus D
divided by n pages plus the summation so
the first thing we'll do is introduce a
new variable we'll call it new rank and
we'll assign it to this value then we're
going to update it as we go through the
pages that link into this page so we'll
start by initializing new rank as one
minus D divided by the number of pages
so then what we need to do is update for
the summation and I'm gonna leave this
blank and I'm gonna skip that for now
this is going to be left as a quiz we'll
finish the rest of the code and then
your quiz will be to finish this part of
the code which is really the most
interesting part of computing the page
ranks once we've done that so we use new
rank as our variable to keep track of
the rank for this page but we want to
update our dictionary so we're gonna add
an entry new ranks we're still within
the for loop you're gonna put your code
that sums up all the links here once
we've done that we've got the value of
new rank that reflects both the
probability of starting from that page
and the popularity from all the end
links and so we'll update this to be a
new rank we've added that to our
dictionary so once we've finished
looping through all the pages in the
graph
well now we're ready for the next step
so that means we want to make the
variable ranks refer to the new ranks so
we've changed the time step to the next
time step and now we're gonna go back
through this loop and we go through this
loop number of loops times each time
we're updating the ranks and when we're
done what we want to return is ranks
that's the dictionary that map's each
page to its rank</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
