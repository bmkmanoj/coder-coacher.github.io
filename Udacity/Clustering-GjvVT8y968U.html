so our goal let's suppose we're just
worrying about the intensity of a pixel
where its intensity is just a single
value right so it's a grayscale image it
goes from 0 to 1 0 to 255 minus 27 to
plus 18
whatever your range happens to be the
idea is that you've got this linear
dimension along which the values are
distributed in this case we're going so
there's our distribution of our pixels
right so there's a little circle down
here let's say for every pixel that's in
the image alright and the question is
how do we find these centers these
clusters that we say okay those are our
three cluster centers and once we found
them we could say alright I've got these
three different areas of the image 1 2 &amp;amp;
3 again what do we mean by a good
cluster
well generically here we're gonna talk
about that our best clusters are
clusters whose centers minimize the SSD
the sum of squared differences between
the all their points and their centers
okay so the idea here here's our SSD and
it says summing over all the clusters
given a point within the cluster these
actually make that square just so it's
clear the distance between the point and
the cluster center alright and the
challenge in finding these clusters is
that it's a little bit of a chicken and
the egg problem all right so here's
right suppose this is what Q suppose we
knew where the cluster centers were
right so they're here here and here
well if we knew those where the cluster
centers were which points would we
assign to each cluster well that would
be pretty easy just as it says in the
answer we would assign the points to the
cluster depending upon which cluster
center they were closest to so given the
center it's obvious to assign the points
on the other hand what if we instead of
knowing the cluster centers all we knew
is the cluster memberships that's what
these ovals are significant to us
showing right we know which points
belong to which clusters right this is
the chicken problem or the egg pride oh
no it's the other problem the question
is if I knew which clusters the points
belong to we
would I put the sinners well I would put
the centers to be the mean the average
of each of the points of their cluster
so everybody know why do you know why if
I gave you a bunch of scores that
represented how people were doing on a
test and I asked you sort of you know
what's what you know how well do you
think people do on this test you would
take the average you know why you take
the average turns out the average is the
value that minimizes the sum of squared
differences it's trivial to show and the
reason you do that is you believe
somewhere in your head that the actual
thing you're looking at is a
distribution that's centered about a
point with a Gaussian fall-off around it
right some some value whose probability
falls off as the square of the distance
so the value that would generate the
maximum likelihood of the data is the
mean value because it minimizes the sum
of squared differences I thought every
master student in computer science would
have known that and I just gave this
lecture just a little while ago in class
here and it turned out well they were
undergraduates on there too so maybe
they were the ones who didn't know that
but not everybody knew that so the
reason we take the averages of things
the mean value is is it minimizes the
sum of squared distance and if you have
a Gaussian model or any other
distribution where the likelihood of
probability falls off as a square then
if you minimize the sum of the squares
you generate the the value for which the
data you saw would have the maximum
likelihood just tuck that away so you'll
remember it somewhere</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
