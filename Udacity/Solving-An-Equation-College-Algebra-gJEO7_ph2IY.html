in the problem we did for grant that we
have to change both sides of an equation
in the same way to make sure that we
maintain equality so this last choice
down here is correct the answer we ended
up with also was a way of expressing an
unknown quantity in terms of other
information that we had which is this
third choice and we found that C equals
6.5 we could plug that number back into
our original equation to make it a true
equation so this first answer works as
well we could not however change one
side of our equation we could not
however change one side of our equation
in a different way than the other side
and we also didn't have in mind in
advance what number we wanted the
variable to equal so this answer right
here the second one is not something
that we want to select</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
