imagine that we've got a graph with n
nodes and M edges and we're going to try
to find out whether it's colorable with
K colors by turning it into a big
formula like the one I just showed you
I'm going to know how many clauses are
in the formula and just to make that a
bit more concrete a clause is the sort
of thing that I've got here in parens
it's between the ands we have a list of
things that are combined and then
there's an and and then there's more
things that are combined and and so how
many things are being ANDed together in
the formula so I want you to figure out
an actual expression in terms of K and
an M that will tell you the answer but
I'll actually ask you to do it for just
a concrete example
so imagine we've got three colors 8
nodes and 20 edges how many clauses are
in the formula that result from
converting this 3 colorability problem
into a satisfiability problem when you
have your answer write it in this box
and we'll check it for you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
