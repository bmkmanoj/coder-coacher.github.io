doing I'm doing okay good it's a you
know exciting to beginning to talk about
reinforcement learning hmm
reinforcement learning it's my favorite
type of learning is that true it is true
Wow like machine learning I like machine
learning too but of all the kinds of
machine learning reinforcement learning
is my favorite kind of learn so what
what let's how about about giving the
opportunity for the students in the
class to learn about reinforcement
learning by having us tell them about it
let's do that you first all right we're
gonna build on this stuff you told us
about last time
you mean the fantastic well-defined and
well formalized stuff that we talked
about last time yes it was fantastic and
it laid the groundwork for what I would
like to talk about so you set up Markov
decision processes and I'm going to talk
about what it means to learn in that
context excellent I find it useful to
start off by thinking about a
reinforcement learning API like
application programmer interface so what
you talked about is is this box here the
idea of being able to take a model of an
MDP which consists of a transition
function T and a reward function R and
it goes through some code and you know
comes out and the policy comes out right
no policy is is like PI it maps States
to actions and that whole activity what
would you call that what you call the
the problem of or the approach of taking
models and turning them into policies
maybe I'll call them planning yeah
that's what that's that's what it's
hoping you would say mm-hm
all right now we're going to talk about
a different set up here we're still
interested in spinning out policies
right figuring out how to behave to
maximize reward but a learner is going
to do something different instead of
taking a model as input it's going to
take transitions it's going to take
samples of being in some state taking
some action observing a reward and
observing the state that is at the other
end of that transition all right and
Will's and I put a little star on that
to say what we're going to see a bunch
of these transitions hmm and using that
information we're going to instead of
computing a policy we're going to learn
a policy see so we call that learning
yeah or even reinforcement learning hmm
by the way what makes it reinforcement
learning that's a question it's not a
good question but it's a question I was
gonna say good question but I'll well
maybe maybe there it's not that it was a
bad question it says I don't have a
particularly good answer for it so maybe
we did another
to discuss that okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
