equal to 3 i would type in on my
keyboard X a backslash symbol the
letters l e and then a space right after
you hit the space the backslash on the l
ii will transform into a less than or
equal to sign and that's also what these
letters stand for less than or equal to
if you don't type in a space after these
characters then nothing will happen once
you have entered a space you can
continue typing I would just hit three
to get x is less than or equal to 3 I've
greater than or equal to symbol works in
a similar way you would type backslash
than GE and a space you're going to have
a chance to practice that here and here
just by typing in what I have written
here and then as a challenge to you
you'll be able to try these two
inequalities notice that they contain an
infinity symbol for the infinity symbol
you simply need to type in a backslash
and then the letters I n F and a space
the space again will transform these
characters into your infinity symbol for
this infinity it's negative so I put a
negative sign in front first this is
just the minus sign or the dash on your
keyboard try playing around with your
keyboard and see if you can get these
same math expressions using math quail
it's pretty cool</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
