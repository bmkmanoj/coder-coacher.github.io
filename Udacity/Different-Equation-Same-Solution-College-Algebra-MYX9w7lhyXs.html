let's see if there's a different
inequality we can look at they can give
us the same solution set I'm just
quickly going to rewrite the original
inequality that we have and let's see if
I can modify it to simplify it a little
bit one thing I'd like you to notice is
that this negative sign outside of the
entire expression is going to
effectively multiply either both terms
in the numerator by negative 1 or
multiply the entire denominator by
negative 1 so we can consider this a
common factor of for example both terms
in the numerator there's one more common
factor within one of the quantities here
and that's 2 in the quantity 2x minus 4
both 2x and negative 4 are divisible by
2 let's rewrite this because
multiplication is commutative I can move
these factors around however I want and
I think what I'd like to do is to write
this factor of negative 1/2 as a single
constant outside of the rest of the
terms multiplying that fraction now we
can very clearly see that there's this
factor out here this constant factor
that we can just divide both sides by to
get rid of however since we will be
dividing by a fraction we can
equivalently just multiply it by its
reciprocal or multiply by negative 2 on
both sides of course now here's the
kicker remember that since we're
multiplying by a negative number on both
sides we need to switch the direction of
the inequality so now we have this new
inequality X plus 10 over the quantity X
plus 2 times the quantity X minus 2 is
less than 0 and in fact if you went
through the entire process of solving
for x here you'd find that the solution
set for this inequality is exactly the
same as the solution set for this
inequality appear and we can tell why
that's the case these are equivalent we
move from this one to this one using
completely legal algebraic modifications
let's see how graphs can help us
understand this inequality a little bit
better</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
