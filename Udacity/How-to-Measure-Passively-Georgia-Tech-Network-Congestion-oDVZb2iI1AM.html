network traffic management one way to do
this is using the packet and byte
counters provided by the simple network
management protocol many network devices
provide what's called a management
information base or a mid that can be
pulled or queried for particular
information one common use for SNMP is
to pull a particular interface on a
network device for the number of bytes
or packets that it's sent by
periodically polling we can then
determine the rates at which traffic is
being sent on a link by simply taking
the difference in these packet and byte
counters over particular intervals the
advantage of SNMP is that it's fairly
ubiquitous it's supported on essentially
all networking equipment and there are
many products for polling and analyzing
SNMP data on the other hand it's fairly
coarse and you cannot express complex
queries on the data its course in the
sense that because we're just polling
byte or packet counts on the interface
we can't ask specific questions such as
how much traffic has been sent by a
particular host or by a particular flow
- other ways to measure passively are by
monitoring at a packet level granularity
whereby monitors can see full packet
contents or at least headers or at a
flow level where a monitor may see
specific statistics about individual
flows in the network let's now talk a
little bit about packet and flow
monitoring</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
