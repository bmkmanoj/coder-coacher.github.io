before we go to the next event Susan
said that this was an absolute threshold
test does I have anything to do with the
difference threshold test we saw earlier
that's a good question Andi it's related
do you remember with the difference
threshold we were looking at how much is
stimulus needed to change in order to
detect it right the contestants could
detect the difference between like 100
and 105 grams but not necessarily a
hundred and hundred and one exactly well
with it absolute thresholds we're
looking to see how much of stimulus is
needed to be detected at all okay I
think I see so we're answering different
questions for example what's the
quietest sound that a human can hear
exactly but in this event we're
measuring pitch we want to see what the
highest pitch a human can hear is we're
looking at the limits of human
perception that's really exciting now oh
it looks like they've actually already
begun let's go to the event</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
