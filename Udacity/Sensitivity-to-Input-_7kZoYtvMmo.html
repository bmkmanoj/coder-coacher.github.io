to also make sure of another important
property and I don't recall you saying
exactly that the contents of the output
has to be the contents of the same as
the contents of the input so if we had
input which was 3 to 1 and we had output
which is 4 5 6 that is in order okay and
it is integers but I don't think it's
what we would mean by saying that the
output was a sorted version of the input
okay so you want to try again here yeah
let me make sure I have what you just
said correct in my head
so given a input vector of 3 2 1
right we're gonna map that to 4 5 6
cities so is that a legitimate output of
the sort what we're trying to do in the
short routine no it's not so we need to
say something of along the lines of that
for every element in the output vector
why that element exists in the input
vector X so it it better be the case
we're not allowed to have that 4 5 6
there so once again if we started with 3
2 1 how about an output that is 1 1 1 1
1 2 3 okay so we have 3 2 1
and that's got a map to 1 1 say 2 3 yeah
sure ok all right so we also need to say
something then about I guess the
cardinality or the how many times the
elements appear in the input vector X
they need to appear that same number of
times in the output vector Y ok so for
everything in the input it's got to for
every individual item in the input it
has to show up as a separate individual
item in the output well how about if we
then take 3 2 1 and map it to 1 2 3 4 so
which satisfies your specification right
we can't have any new elements appear
either in the output vector Y sounds
like we're getting a little verbose
with our original definition here so
you're not you're not comfortable that
we captured what seems to be a simple
concept of sorting okay in a in a
similarly simple expression of what the
specification is okay and if you think
about it for a minute sorting is pretty
simple if you imagine trying to specify
the software on the International Space
Station or something something you
better get right or you know if it
doesn't work there safety issues it
makes sense to spend some time in trying
to state precisely what's going on here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
