make a similar argument here which is
sort of made when you ask me that
question right with ask me the question
before we started the quiz which is well
if I want to eat a big dot I need to
avoid the ghosts along the way so maybe
eating a big dot or eating a dot is
really requires that I know almost
everything except you know in the worst
case eating a big dot doesn't require
that I know where the little dots are
even if I need to worry about where the
ghosts are and whether they're scared or
not although if I know where the dots
are then I might choose to eat the big
dots in such a way that I eat a bunch of
little dots as well but this is really a
kind of this point out two things one it
sort of points out that if my options
are not written in exactly the right way
then I may not be able to find an
optimal policy will talk about that in
just a moment but if I worry about that
then all of these options have to solve
every single problem and I kind of get
nothing out of it I don't get a big win
by even thinking about it in terms of
options because effectively I'm just
trying to solve the entire problem the
whole point of abstraction is kind of
the software engineering and computing
sense and and here where we're using it
is that in part it allows you to do an
abstraction not just over time it allows
you to do state abstraction and other
kinds of abstraction so what do I mean
by state abstraction here well if you
look at the eat big dot case if I don't
have to worry about where the dots are
never mind where the ghosts and whether
they're scared or not that means that if
I needed to learn this policy if I
needed to figure out how to most
optimally solve the problem of eating
dots I can actually ignore large parts
of the state space what happens if I can
ignore large smarts or the state space
Michael then you can solve the problems
more efficiently right in the very
beginning we said the thing that made
reinforcement learning hard is that as
the number of states crew the problem
became more and more difficult it was
sort of super linear in the number of
states so if I can avoid whole features
of the states that is I can collapse
states that are otherwise different as
if they were a single state whether that
where the dots are don't matter then the
problem of learning this policy learning
this option actually becomes easier both
from a planning point of view and from a
learning point so it's as if the state
space gets smaller
right so temporal abstraction doesn't
just by his temporal abstraction it buys
a state abstraction at least if we can
divide the world up appropriate me okay
I mean is there a guarantee that we can
always do that no there's not a
guarantee that we can always do that in
the kinds of problems that people can
solve maybe it's pretty common because
people don't have infinite computational
resources either right and in practice I
mean if you just even think about the
way you were just describing things you
sort of ignore you you ignore large
parts of what's going on around you in
order to solve the problem right we do
these kinds of things all the time it
had better be the case that we can
ignore large parts of the state space
because otherwise we're in trouble it's
going to be very difficult to move
around in the world I mean first off the
worlds of palm DP so we're ignoring
large parts of the state space anyway
but beyond that i'm in this room talking
to you there are things going on outside
i can't see by and large I can mostly
ignore them at least it for short
periods of time and we just have to hope
in the real world that the parts of the
state space that might matter such as I
don't know a polar bear the location of
the closest polar bear it will be
announced to me when that becomes
relevant and I can start paying
attention to it in which case I'm going
to stop worrying about eating my big
dots which is what i call teaching this
class and instead start avoiding ghosts
which is what i call running away from
polar bears</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
