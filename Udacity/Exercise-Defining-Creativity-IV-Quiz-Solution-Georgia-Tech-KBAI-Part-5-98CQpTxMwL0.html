one at a time the first one says yes
because in order for the result to be
creative it must be novel and output of
an algorithm cannot be novel
well there are a few problems with this
particular answer what an output of an
algorithm for a small closed word
problem cannot be normal the output of
combinations of algorithms for
open-ended problem can and indeed
sometimes is novel there are algorithms
for example they do design or they do
scientific discovery whose results are
now let's okay the second answer yes
because given a set of input the output
will always be the same therefore the
product can never be unexpected the
output will depend not just on the input
and not only on the methods of the
system but also the situation in which
the methods are situated the output
depends not just on the input and there
the method the air agent uses but also
the context in which the air agent is
situated for example given the same
input but different context for the
input the agent become up with very
different outputs very different
understandings or the same input as we
saw in this section on understanding the
third answer no because it defines
creativity in terms of the output then
the process this answer to has problems
because sometimes creativity can be
defined simply in terms of the output
without knowing anything about the
process we can think over a black box
that creates very interesting creative
music we may not know anything about the
process it is using but if the output is
interesting and creative music we would
consider it to be creative personally my
sympathies lie with the fourth answer
but of course you are welcome to
disagree with me why don't we continue
