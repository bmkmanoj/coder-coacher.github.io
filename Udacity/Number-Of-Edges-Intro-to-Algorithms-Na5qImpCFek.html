again so we now know how deep its login
and we know how many leaves it's n at
each of these levels not only is it
going to compute the sub graph of the
given size but then it's going to add
one more edge that is the connector
between the two components so there's
one of those edges gets added at this
level there's two that get added at this
level there's four that get added at
this level there's eight that gets added
at this level until finally at the end
of the day there's zero that get added
to this level but the level right above
it there's and so the total number of
edges that get added is the sum of all
these things n plus n over 2 plus n over
4 to 1 and that it's basically 2 times n
so that we don't have to say basically
we can say it's exactly big data event
meaning it's basically to it so what we
basically rediscovered is that the
number of edges in a tree or that one of
these randomly generated trees is still
linear so that's not so surprising but
this particular way of doing the
analysis with this tree is going to turn
out to be useful in some other settings</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
