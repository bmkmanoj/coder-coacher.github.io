Udacity course page for this class since
d3 is a client-side JavaScript library
you can load on to any web page that
you're on and start playing around with
the elements of HTML or SVG contained on
that page if you're on any of the web
pages of the data visualization class d3
should already be loaded but if you're
on a webpage that does not have d3
loaded you can simply copy the d3 source
and paste it in the web console I will
be using the Google Chrome browser
throughout this course but any modern
browser should have all the same
functionality of a JavaScript console
and an HTML inspector to open the
JavaScript console we can go to the
toolbar of Chrome
accessed from the upper right corner of
the browser window scroll down to the
sub menu of tools and from tools you can
see here that we can view source access
the developer tools or go into the
JavaScript console as you notice here it
pops up a window on the bottom of my
browser that lets me enter an execute
JavaScript unfortunately at zipfian
Academy we do not have the engineers or
great production team that Udacity has
to create such a compelling online
education platform what we do have
however is a knowledge of d3 and
JavaScript so instead of building our
own platform
let's usurp Udacity and pretend that we
have their own platform as well we can
do this by changing the branding of
Udacity logo maybe some elements with
the course and actually change anything
else on the webpage that we may want to</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
