ways to measure brain activity starting
with the electroencephalograph II this
is commonly called an EEG it records
electrical activity of the brain through
electrodes placed on the scalp this
technique is really good at showing
general activity of the brain but it's
not terribly precise that's showing
where exactly the activity is occurring
this is what a typical one would look
like next we have the positron emission
tomography or PET scan for short this
measures blood flow to brain areas that
are activated because neural response
requires blood this technology requires
a person to ingest a harmless
radioactive form of oxygen or glucose
the radioactive level and the oxygen is
picked up by the scanning device during
brain activity computers then color code
the most active areas in red somewhat
active areas in yellow and the least
active areas in blue and green like you
see here and finally we have the
functional magnetic resonance imaging or
fMRI for short this also measures blood
flow to active brain regions but it
doesn't use radioactive forms of oxygen
instead the fMRI uses magnetic fields to
detect regions of the brain that are
activated one advantage of this is that
it can give us a very precise picture of
which part of the brain is active this
is what a typical fMRI machine looks
like now it's really important to point
out that none of these techniques
directly measure neural activity they
all measure it indirectly there are ways
of measuring individual neurons but
because it involves surgery it's almost
never used on humans I know there's a
lot of information about the brain
structure so if you need to you can go
over some of the parts of the lesson
again or always go back to the document
we gave you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
