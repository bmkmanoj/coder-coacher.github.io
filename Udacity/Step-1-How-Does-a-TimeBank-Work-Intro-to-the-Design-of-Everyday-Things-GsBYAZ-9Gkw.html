time bank might work let's say I'm
looking for someone to fix my bike well
by teaching design to other time Bank
members I've accumulated a credit of
hours I look and I find Jane who is an
excellent bike repair person and I
invite her to my project we agree on the
job the work is completed and the bike
is now running great and so we make the
transfer of hours which have been
deducted from my account and added to
Jane's I'll bet some of you are already
thinking about how this works as a
system well there's my screen and then
there's Jane's screen and then there's
some administrator at the bank even
though this is a more complex system for
this project to make it simple we're
just going to focus on a single person's
user interface and experience what your
screens would look like if you were
using the bank</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
