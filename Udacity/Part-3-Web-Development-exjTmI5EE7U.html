databases were about joins and
specifically how you do a lot of more
complicated queries without joins okay
because that seems pretty fundamental to
a lot of database administrators yes
joins are fundamental to two databases
and particularly sequel databases and
and I said don't use joins now a lot of
this is opinion but it's based on
experience so the reason I say don't use
joins it's because joins don't scale
very well so if you're writing kind of a
typical web problem where you think
you're going to have lots of data and
that that is going to eventually need to
be spread across multiple machines
running queries that involve multiple
tables joining these two large pieces of
data together or potentially more than
two across altima sheen's is very very
difficult there's a lot of research
going on to make that possible but with
the consumer tools it's not going to
work very well for you're gonna have to
figure out something on your own now if
you structure your data in such a way
that everything is independent you don't
have to worry about that thing's scale a
lot nicer you have to take this into
account when you start though you know
you need to think of your databases that
basically these large key value stores
and you're not going to do complex
queries you know you're going to look up
things by ID or maybe look up things by
single columns but you're not gonna be
joining things together now one of the
things you you don't have to do there
then is store some redone to death you
know if you have your data nice and
normalized that is all of all of the
data for a particular type is in a table
for that type and you join everything
together a query time that's a
nice-looking database but as soon as you
break things apart you know you might
need to store you know effectively kind
of cash other pieces of data in other
tables you know unread it we store you
know a user's karma I think on on a link
they submitted so we have that piece of
data handy so we don't have to fetch the
user and a link and all that sort of
stuff so it means there's some more
maintenance overhead when you do an
insert you know when you update a
particular field you may have to update
it in a couple places but that to me is
is easier a little bit more easier to
manage them trying to figure out how do
you run joins across large data sets
across multi machines now if you have a
small data set and it fits on one
machine great use joints you know do
what works for you you know on Hipmunk
for example
we have a database of hotels it's 300
thousand entries long it's not getting
any bigger because that's about how many
hotels there on the world yeah leaves
joins in that database it makes the
problem easier but on reddit you know we
have databases of links and comments and
votes those tables can have more than a
billion rows we're not doing joins on
those tables like those are spread
across many machines you know just to
make the queries work so again you know
use what makes sense if you're going to
be storing lots of data try to think
about how you store data in individual
tables okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
