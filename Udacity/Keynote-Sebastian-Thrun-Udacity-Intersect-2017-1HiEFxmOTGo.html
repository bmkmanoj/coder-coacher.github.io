god
the reason why it exists is
have this dream that if we can make
education globally universally available
if it doesn't matter that they will live
live in the Middle East or in South
America you get the same medication
everywhere
the vegan completely transformed the
world I want to thank all of you for the
trust you're putting in us by giving us
your time your attention in coming here
you guys are my heroes and we do what we
do because of you thank you life is
short life is crazy a few months ago we
started a nano degree program on
self-driving cars anybody can roll Boop
awesome that's great we are the only
institution in the world
we'll teach yourself diving cars we have
over 5,000 students which means we teach
more engineers for the straight then all
universities combined and I have been
blown away what you guys are
accomplishing and I not saying this as a
novice or as an educator I'm saying this
because I've done a thing or two and
surviving cause of myself and no artists
you've been blowing my mind
Oliver who runs our local car team on
the car side live a session this
afternoon and show what you guys our
students have accomplished in our car in
terms of safety and hockey ability and
not to steal his thunder
but he just you your students just met a
major milestone by building and auditing
our car to drive itself from here to San
Francisco and El Camino l hundreds in
front of us this is a
I can tell you when I founded the Google
team for us to do the stretch from here
to in San Frisco the same Road took more
than a year of work and it took you guys
students
thanks to your contributions about three
months to build that capability so the
Udacity self-driving car is not just an
educational program it's also a
milestone in self-driving actually no
officially a California registered
self-driving car company how cool is
that the students that made this
possible are probably in this audience
our people who are totally amazing Elena
is not with us she's in Belarus but she
did really blow away work on behavioral
cloning and project that all of you are
working on and take she's not the only
ones there about 5,000 other great
people doing amazing work on behavior
cloning but she's one of the people who
worked day and night to really put a
component of our software together Vivek
also not here today unfortunately it's
actually a professor himself PhD
professor and by being a professor got
bored with what professors do which is
writing proposals and stuff like this
and when they go back to coding and
found another V and became a student
again and he's also not just writing he
was the piece of software that blew my
mind he was able to track other cars
just using a camera alone something I've
never been able to accomplish at Google
when I was there he was in record time
it's also a beautiful community person
really helps other students like crazy
to make advances and lastly third person
I wanna mention is John and John su is
in the audience
John Chen
I it never occurred to me that students
like John and many other students could
write software at a level that I think
is on par with the absolute best
self-driving engineering as seen in my
life and I'm humble to see oh my god I
always feel like when I'm going to look
at these results and Oliver flips these
videos by me I was humbled to realize
that your CUSO it twice my IQ and I get
the privilege to work with all of you we
have a Udacity race team that's entirely
here entering can you guys stand up so
it's the end
Anthony Navarro Christy call the icon
group policy man Narayana
John Chen Dean do claudio servitor the
motives and Chris Grundy call the names
and they are joining the polishing soft
seven car race event now be health
hopefully definitely wins Udacity I want
to take some time and answer any
question you might have you have two
microphones one over there and one over
there I usually have speak as a
professor I mean if you see me in class
you probably I don't play listen to you
very much are just talking so it's a
good chance to discuss anything is on
your mind it's a question right here use
the microphone please
thank you
so currently self-driving cars the car
itself is X amount of dollars with the
senses and everything is the same
process the car itself and I think the
biggest impact could be made in the
tablet countries where the roads are not
always perfect and you can have like
self-driving cars with you're building
roads you know what I mean like the
machine itself is building the
infrastructure for other machines so how
do you envision cheap self-driving cars
like we have mobile phones so every
person has a version of their own like
personal transportation so here you ask
two questions one is how do envision
cost-effective cheap selling cars and
second write on cars to down roads yeah
so I've never studied cars that build
their own roads that is a new question I
also don't know what I mean obviously we
have heavy automation and Road building
I see less of the reasons to get rid of
humans entirely for Road building then
what using because the builds of
advanced over users like 10,000 times
every day the cost actually massively
shifting right now in this field when I
first worked with radars which is what
you drive the cruise control the
cheapest radar could buy was $60,000 and
if you go to Delphi or Continental or
Bosch today you get the same beta for
about 80 US dollars and the difference
is that we now have scale products you
call the technical control that uses
evaders and the Dean manufactures in the
millions as opposed to the individual
units the laser world hasn't reached
that level yet so if you go to valide
and order laser it comes back six months
later with a handwritten serial number
they build them still one on one but
there's a whole bunch of great startups
in that space and if you have other
aspirations and space is a great space
to be in
we have actually moved off into camera
images so but Oliver story later is most
of it's driven by cameras and cameras
have become commodities as super cheap
so
think the costs will not be the issue
the real challenge is the brains is to
make sure that they are hundred percent
safe and not just 99.999% say thanks
yeah okay it can you hear me okay so
we're a different company and we're
looking at the underprivileged people
who didn't have the chance to get great
engineering education or math and
programming and AI and we're kind of
stepping up the team to do data labeling
collection and annotation things like
that for refugees in Jordan as well as
India and things like that but was
wondering about what is it audacity
thought process for enabling these
people who didn't have such a great
education to contribute and grow jobs
and and do things that are interesting
and participate in the economy if I had
infinite exactly my way and had infinite
time then I would love to address every
job in the world and help every single
person involved we have what at this
point 25,000 or so enrolled students and
there are seven point four billion
people we actually very very poorly
relative to what we should be doing in
our company and that we're growing
obviously rapidly and we are trying to
build the trust but they are very much
arguing internally whether we only do
bleeding edge Silicon Valley which is
south of in Carver bollocks as we
announced today machine learning or
whether we also start going down to
lesser paid jobs so that with a lesser
pre-qualifications we have some
beginning other ways deep learning is
among them induction of programming and
I think we're going to stay in the tech
space for now we stay in the tech space
for multiple reasons one is it's super
hot it's very fast moving and it can be
conveyed online very well whereas other
fields like nursing and so on would
probably have a much more physical
dimension but yes I want to get to the
point where every single person on the
planet has a chance to get an
educational system
just can't do everything in the same day
unfortunately that's the main obstacle
oh yeah I think you're making progress
there's a lot of work left for us to do
yeah if you have any thoughts on you
know enablement or things other that can
do not necessarily I'm sorry I'm saying
if you have any thoughts on things that
others can do to enable this class of
people or these underprivileged people
would love to hear your thoughts on that
and cook Sudan we have a very very
active scholarship program now that to
advice building up and it's my been my
personal passion I make no securities
from a personal passion to go to the
Middle East and and help jumpstart I've
talked to the king of Jordan being
negotiation to them we have now ground
officers in Saudi Arabia specifically so
we go to the Middle East and say look
guys anybody here who grows up can
become an end result and will you make
this to me the audacity contribution to
world peace I don't want to sit there
and say things I want to do things and I
feel especially in the Middle East to be
honest great education is actually not
as accessible as from a year in America
but yes we have suggestions send me
emails thr UN and udacity.com okay and
thank you I love to hear if go over
there and alliances on line up I guess
this question kind of marries with the
previous question Udacity started with
the when the nanodegree started was the
front end nanodegree and then very
quickly Career Services came up around
that and started reviewing like github
and LinkedIn and resumes and now is
moving into AI and machine learning and
so much growth and expansion and a
Career Services team has grown with that
also in helping hundreds of students
find jobs and with like the nanodegree
plus so what do you what do you think
are the the next steps of Udacity and
career services team moving forward from
this point on helping students connect
with more John yeah Vee when we when we
started Udacity vvd thought education is
anything in the vacuum you do for
yourself although for some people it is
but we really felt if you're serious
about education
then you're going to be suitable jobs
and that made us basically start to
companies not one company right so a job
company that helps even jobs and
dedication company but with either piece
missing it's almost like a water pipe
that's clocked somewhere so you go to
this point I can go for that that's why
in the last year we put even more
emphasis on jobs and job placement and
drop services career services then we
put even education to be honest
certificate II is going to be important
for us to do both because we believe as
we still have the pipe right like great
people come in and we assign them a
little bit and then we have to find in
the great place in life going forward
we're just going to do more of this
honest thing we launched the cyclone
blitz
let's is I guess the German works our
sides we're all of you upon graduation
can interact with companies we cater
blitz a lot of startup companies startup
companies in the valley are desperate to
find talent like yourself
turns out any machine learning for you
to get the job here any self-storage
need to get the job robotics person and
we found that by marrying you guys with
startup companies through a platform
like blitz we can de risk it for
everybody we can do risk it for you
because you're not moving entire family
to a place company don't know and we do
risk it for the sella company because
they can try out and work with you and
see they like working with you and
that's been phenomenally successful we
taste a good number of people and jobs
afterwards I just want to stay creative
innovative and see what it takes I mean
we are reinventing everything they're
building basically a shadow university
system here and reimagining what a
university should be in 21st century
we're just at the beginning
honestly we fail the students who can't
find jobs the students who aren't able
to give the self confidence to find a
job but you're doing our best to make
that thing really happen and I'm very
proud of our progress so far thank you
so in the logging industry when a tree
comes down it's directly replaced by a
new tree which initially in a in the
logging industry when trees come down
they're immediately replaced on the new
tree
that's a responsibility of the logging
industry to do that yeah when AI and
automated cars or even ride-sharing
takes away jobs like I know you dasa tia
is a great job of creating opportunities
for learning and taking on new jobs but
do you feel that there's a
responsibility on the large industries
to either slow down or directly replace
those jobs because some people can't
wait for six months it takes to ramp up
an entirely new career we are in a in
the transition period that's extremely
significant and I don't think people see
it optimized yet we are in a period
that's Atkin of the beginning of the
Agricultural Revolution when the steam
engine was invented and while our
customers she never really but we place
people in the physical sense of
duplicated people it made farmers a
hundred times as efficient and before
that 90 or so percent of Europeans were
confirming after that it was less than
2% what's happening today is that
artificial intelligence will take any
office job that's repetitive
when 8 people 100 effective to be an
accountant if your lawyer your medical
doctor if there's a whole spectrum of
jobs 75% of Americans broken offices
there's a whole spectrum of jobs if you
do the same repetitive stuff over and
over again and we're going to invent the
AI that makes people Hunnam centers
effective and if you don't believe it
check out the cover of nature about a
month ago and skin cancer where students
from Stanford accomplish the training of
a deep network of the type we teach here
to detect skin cancer and an accuracy
that rivals the best human dermatologist
so in the future rather than going to a
doctor
you pull your phone and you get the same
diagnostic quality now the
responsibility of new jobs is a tricky
question I think it's going to put a
burden on all of us
I think the IRA culture evolution was
great I'm super happy I don't have to
work in the field every day I'm actually
happy to be here
none of you were here without it and all
the stuff we care about mark our to our
microphone to our smartphone wouldn't
exist and didn't exist prior to the
revolution a dead driver changed the
notion of human labor had he gotten
together four hundred years ago you
would have said there without a
microphone and saying look I work in the
feed every day and what's going to
happen when we invent stuff that's
stronger than me what's going to happen
to me and what happened is life became
so much better we started how to
learning how to read how to write how to
communicate how to do research how to
invent things now the make was better
and faster and safer
this was going to be on steroids so what
I envision is that thanks to a I think
AI is the single biggest thing happening
today that we can get rid of repetitive
remedial boring work and replace it with
creative work all of you are incredibly
creative and most people are know
insanely creative and are being forced
to do uncreated work every day and it
pains me we are going to go into a face
that anybody can do social media
creative work they can beat it say a
self-driving car in a day or a DD in a
day Bob spoke earlier or you can build
in Amazon in a day and it has already an
evening and you push a few buttons and
next morning you can try it out there's
always I mean these transformations talk
about responsibility they always global
and technologies trust in the neighbor
to be honest if that they affect real
people and it's important to have a
dialogue on this I think it's
unstoppable I'd rather be on the
tsunamis and under the tsunami and quite
frankly I'm actually excited to live
today because I firmly believe that only
1% of interesting things have been
invented yet in 99% has not been
invented yet and you're the peoples were
going to invent the next percent of cool
stuff to invent yes
here on first off I'd like to thank all
of you guys at Udacity you guys have
been a true inspiration to me I mean I
love learning and you guys have given me
higher kicks than alcohol or illegal
drugs or illegal drugs combined so
thanks a lot keep up the great work
so now coming to the questions have two
questions so what I've seen today's
world is a little bit concerning a lot
of polarization you know there's a
disparity of thoughts you have people
who love to learn we use Udacity and
other platforms to learn you look yeah
who use Internet to learn you know to
become more aware of what's happening
but at the same time there are people
who are not who are using it for other
purposes it's like when television was
invented people caught it called the
idiot box but television has some good
stuff as well so today's the other
extreme no information is on demand
people choose to check out stuff which
really is not helping our society if you
know what I mean we are creating
anti-social elements or dumbed down
people who can fall prey to anything
they see yeah they're treated five the
more you know so I mean how do we solve
this and I mean an extreme example is
there's one segment which is saying
climate change is real it's a real
problem but suddenly there is another
group saying climate changes Hawks yeah
now what do we do about this so first
thanks for your compliments and honestly
I love any of those emails I get where
someone says here's something you did
great in my life well you definitely did
this for us and that we pass around the
company every single time we have about
250 fully dedicated people who work day
and night to make these things possible
so every time thank you so much any of
us a listen to to another thing we
actually really grateful services it's
wonderful for people the very mission
driven it's it's a question that I don't
think you'd ask you can fix but I'm an
optimist and I would applaud all of you
optimism is always be the case to be a
plurality of opinions and it always be
the case that even majority opinion can
be wrong if you look at the history of
this country for example not so long ago
we believed that a marriage between a
black person the right person was not
okay or it was not okay to have two men
or two women marry and that opinion was
revised the same happens in science we
look at medical treatment 100 years ago
you'd be shocked what people belief at
the time before we had evidence medicine
evidence-based medicine I would argue we
should be optimistic for two reasons
okay one is the world is going in the
right direction
science is winning hands down and that
hiccups and their moments of desperation
but the grand scheme of things science
is winning and as a result we all live
better lives and even more parents
generation second reason is if you are
not an optimist and it's not going to
happen
we need the optimists in the world like
yourself to make the change that we need
to believe it and whatever we believe
will happen and my friend thank you
thank you
hi my question is basically on the
hardware computation capability what are
the challenges that lie ahead because
there are millions of algorithms coming
up in terms of machine learning and
other stuff and there are new algorithms
coming up everyday and the amount of
computational capability needed needed
for this algorithms are really heavy so
what do you think of the challenges that
lie ahead in terms of hardware
computation lighter hmm so the challenge
with lighter have no challenges lie
ahead offers a vector like YS yeah in
terms of machine learning yeah if I were
to characterize saying machine learning
is machine learning is certainly the big
new thing in artificial intelligence and
I think what we're learning is that
programming is kind of obsolete in that
it software engineers someone who
instructs the machine with like millions
of rules for every contingency and
really hard as you know because you are
learning it and doing it especially and
as I paid as much money because it's so
hard the lesson for me in deep learning
is we can instruct a machine with data
and data itself takes of his own life
very much like very very certain we
don't waste children by giving me a rule
for every contingency in the first 18
years we let them teach based on data so
we're making computers learn very much
human-like but there's still an enormous
gap between both where computers today
succeed and I think it's phenomenal to
work on and to be honest is when it has
vast amounts of data of something highly
repetitive like for example diagnosing
skin cancer we had 129,000 images no
human Dementors can ever study hundreds
faint nine thousand images so when data
the size of data vastly outweighs for
the human padule you get to the point
with machines one better and better and
better what machines don't do at all in
my opinion is go beyond us like
inventing of discovering spatial
relativity or new lower nature for being
able to take the learnings from over
here and transfer to a complete
different feet over here and I'm not
even sure we have the right evidence
quite the
to do this but obviously as machine
learning and computers and general
proceeded I would love to see work on
how can we build a universal learning
machine and get to more of a broader
eyes in a very narrow way today's AI is
so narrow that the Google self-driving
car cannot fly a plane and alphago can't
play chess right so narrow and you know
last question I apologize for I'm
Courtney and first of all it actually
obviously excels at the education
company and so I have a question about
the job aspect of Udacity so a triple AI
you said that and being a Udacity Nano
to regret it comes
you know maybe priority treatment at
went in the hiring process
but what and the plus degrees do have a
lot of promise as well but what does
that specifically mean for for us and
does it mister me a medic in interview
at say Google or does it mean like
you're guaranteed spot at Udacity blitz
and for their showcase your work in this
case of plus grad or just simply career
advice what's specifically for those of
you know for maybe we'd created a single
exactly plus little Danny ago and it's
basically that's the not agree where we
say if you are eligible to work so you
can't be five years old and you you're
interested in a job and you can't find
one we just give your intuition back no
questions asked
and we did this in part to hold
ourselves accountable to make clear to
assess be a series about jobs and we
can't just fake it and say it if we fail
in doing our missions then we deserve to
make no money I think right now our job
success rate is north of ninety percent
last level it was 96 percent I'm very
proud of this but we have paid some
students money back thank you
but we cannot of course guarantee an
interview we do have amazing
partnerships and it's actually
interesting because I sit on the side
where talk to companies like Tesla and
so on and and in various other tech
comics and video and Men Google of
course on about prime prime is 18 G and
the companies we talk to are desperate
the reason why Mercedes for example is
so active in building software in
canonically or Google with Android and
Nvidia all these wonderful companies
Diddy is there's actually a thirst for
great talent that the great skill set
and there's an understanding that
colleges tend not to produce the right
skill set machine learning is the
hottest thing on the planet right now of
a lot of things there's only one college
that produces the machine learning
degree it's called Carnegie Mellon now
guys it was one one one University right
in the next four thousand different
degrees so we believe by working so
closely with such fantastic companies we
can leg up in job placement and we're
willing to pay for it if not thank you
so much you guys are my inspiration
okay I really believe there's going to
be a future where we all learn all the
time and we work really close with the
companies that we'd love to work with
and we adore and you are making possible
you are partners and your students thank
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
