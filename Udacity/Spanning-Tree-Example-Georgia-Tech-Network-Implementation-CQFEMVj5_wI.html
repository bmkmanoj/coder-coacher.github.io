message format is as follows yd and X
where X is the origin of the message Y
is the node being claimed as root and D
is the distance of the particular node
sending this message X from the claimed
root so initially every switch in the
network broadcasts a message like X 0 X
to indicate that the node that it thinks
itself is the root when other switches
hear this message they compare the ID of
the sender to their own ID and they
update their opinion of who the root is
based on the comparison of these IDs
let's suppose that we have the following
graph and switch number 4 thinks it's
the root so we will send a message for 0
for 2 nodes 2 &amp;amp; 7 but to also thinks it
is the root so 4 is going to receive the
message 2 0 2 from node 2 and then it's
going to realize that 4 is just 1 hop
away from node 2 so node 4 will update
its view of the root to be node 2
eventually for we'll also hear a message
2 1 7 from node 7 indicating that node 7
thinks it is one hop away from its view
of the root which is no - it will
realize that the path through node 7 is
a longer path to the root and it will
remove the link for 7 from the tree we
can repeat this process and ultimately
we will end up with a spanning tree</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
