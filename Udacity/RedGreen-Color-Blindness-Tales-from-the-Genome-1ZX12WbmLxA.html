traits with the example of red-green
colorblindness this trade is most common
in families of North European ancestry
so let's actually take a look at a
fictional family with a Northern
European background meet Henry and this
is a pedigree of Henry's family it shows
that he has an affected father an
affected paternal uncle his father's
brother and an affected maternal
grandfather his mother's father before
we explore the genetic reason for this
particular trait I want to get you to
tell me a couple of things about the
inheritance pattern that you see here in
the pedigree based on the pedigree that
you see here for Henry and his family do
you think this trader red-green
colorblindness represents an inheritance
pattern that's autosomal sex-linked or
maternal and does the trade appear to be
dominant or recessive now if you have
trouble answering this question it's
probably because you need to go back to
lesson 5 for a bit of a refresher where
we learned about pedigrees and dominance
for the first time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
