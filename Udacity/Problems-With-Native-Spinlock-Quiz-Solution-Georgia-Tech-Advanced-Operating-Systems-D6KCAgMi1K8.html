exactly on the right track let's talk
about it first of all you know that with
this with the naive implementation
there's going to be too much contention
for the lock when the lock is released
because everybody both t2 and t3 in the
previous example jumped in and started
looking at the testing test and set
instruction trying to acquire the lock
and if there are thousands of processors
everybody is going to be executing this
test and set instruction so there's
gonna be plenty of contention on the
network in order to get to that shared
variable that's the first problem now
let's talk about why the second answer
is also right answer you know from the
previous lesson that a shared memory
multiprocessor has private caches
associated with every one of the
processors and it is often the case that
the caches may be kept coherent by the
hardware now of the private caches
associated with every processor and if a
value from memory can be cached in that
there is an issue with testing said
instruction and that is testing that
instruction cannot use the cached value
because it has to make sure that the
memory value is modified atomically
while when it is inspecting the memory
and therefore by definition a test and
set instruction is not going to exploit
caches it is going to bypass the cache
and go to memory in order to do the test
and set operation and therefore yes this
is also true that the spin algorithm
that I gave you spent on testing said is
now going to be able to exploit the
caches the third problem is is the fact
that it might disrupt useful work and it
is also a good answer and the reason is
because when a processor releases the
lock after releasing the lock that
processor wants to go on and do some
useful work and similarly if let's say
there are four processors trying to
acquire the lock only one of them is
going to get it and the others are gonna
have to back off because they're not
going to have a lock now the one you one
guy that did get the lock has useful
work to do
because of the fact that there is a lot
of contention the guy that can actually
do useful work is being impeded from
doing useful work because of the
contention that is there in all the
other processes trying to go and get the
lock when it is not available so this is
really the problem that the test and set
instruction because it was bypassing the
cash its first of all causing a lot of
contention on the network and it is also
impeding some of the useful processor
from carrying on with its work which may
advance the cause of the parallel
program so all of these are good answers
in terms of the problems with this with
this naive spinlock</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
