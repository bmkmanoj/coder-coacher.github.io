relate back to the concepts we had
looked at when we looked at the
frequency domain of an image that is how
do we actually start representing things
at the different frequency spectra and
of course we played around with things
like the pyramid so to achieve this
basically we would have to find in the
scale and pyramids of images the most
this the most amount of information in
both space and in scale space in this
case would be the image itself scale is
again the pyramid levels for example
being able to find information at
different frequency spectra differently
so one of the more important methods
that's actually widely used is as I said
sift scale-invariant feature transform
for this process what is suggested is
that basically use the pyramid to find
the maximum values again we use this
kind of stuff to do things like edge
detection and in this case then
eliminate the edges and pick only the
corners so run the same process that
we've been doing before except that now
find all edges using a different
frequencies and then eliminate the edges
and pick only the corners so again the
same concept that we've been doing for
corner detection but except we do it at
multiple scales we find edges at
multiple scales and then we basically
kind of says okay which one of them are
corners are teaching every one of the
scales so in essence what happens now is
that basically at each point is compared
to its eight neighbors shown here so
each point it's compared to it eight
neighbors and then we can of course also
scale it up and down and in this case
each point is also compared to its nine
neighbors above and below in scale so
eight local neighbors at this point and
then above nine points below nine points
and these are of course different scales
which could be computed using again
things like pyramids and stuff like that
we've looked at</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
