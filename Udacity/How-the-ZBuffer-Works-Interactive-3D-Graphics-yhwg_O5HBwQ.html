at each pixel the distance from the
object to the camera is used to compute
it's a Z depth a value from zero to one
so here for example I've rendered a
sphere and at this pixel I found that
the depth of the sphere is zero point
six this value is then checked against
the current value stored in the Z buffer
which you'll recall we've initialized to
all ones if the objects distance is
lower than the Z value stored the object
is closer to the camera and so the color
of the object is then stored in the
images color buffer so in this case the
spheres depth is clearly closer than the
maximum value can store in the Z depth
so it's visible at this point next say
we draw a cube the cube step that this
pixel is 0.3 which is closer than the
zero point six that we have storage for
what the sphere did so since it's closer
we use the cubes color at this pixel and
replace this value zero point three
replaces of zero point six say the last
object we draw is this ground plane at
the pixel it turns out the ground planes
depth is zero point eight
this is higher than the current Z depth
zero point three so the ground plane
fails which is as it should be because
the ground plane is obviously farther
away than these two objects the final
conclusion of this process is that the
current Z depth stays at zero point
three and the color that's stored at the
pixel this blue cube is indeed the color
that gets displayed on the screen by
storing a depth at each pixel the GPU
can mindlessly keep track of what object
is closest to at any given moment
what's interesting to realize is that
decades ago when this idea first came up
of the Z buffer it was considered
absurdly expensive because he had at a
big chunk of memory of Z depth buffer
that was just an outrageous amount you'd
have to add all megabyte of memory which
would be outrageously expensive so this
algorithm originally was a terrible idea
and memory cost came down just a tad and
it's now the predominant way of
rasterizing triangles</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
