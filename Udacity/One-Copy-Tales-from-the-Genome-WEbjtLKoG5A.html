more susceptible to sex-linked traits
than females well it actually has a lot
to do with the fact that the x and the y
don't have the same genes on them and
the x chromosome is also much longer
than the Y chromosome does that mean the
X chromosome has more genes on it it's
exactly what it means and the genes of
the X chromosome has aren't actually on
the Y chromosome so it's beneficial to
have two copies of the X yeah and as
since it is I mean all your other
autosomes you have two copies of right
it's kind of like having a backup copy
for a lot of the jeans and the same way
that you'd have a backup copy for data
on your computer you might have it on
your internal hard drive and then have a
backup copy on an external hard drive so
if one crashes you still have the other
right but you're still not completely
protected because both of the hard
drives could still crash although it's
less likely that both of them would
crash than just one of them and the same
is actually true for recessive alleles
on the X chromosome in the case of males
if you only have one copy of the X a
recessive allele is really more like a
dominant allele because there's no
backup copy to mask the effect of the
recessive allele so for females you
could still be affected by the trait but
if both of your X chromosomes have that
recessive allele exactly we can even see
this in a trait like red-green color
blindness in the general population the
fact that eight percent of males have
some form of red green color blindness
while only point five percent of females
have a similar form of red-green color
blindness well I'm curious are you red
green colorblind let us know and are you
male or a female so we can see how the
distribution lines up with our class
compared to the general population</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
