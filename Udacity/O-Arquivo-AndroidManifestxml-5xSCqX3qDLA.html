for the first time and even though it's
an XML file it can be intimidating to
look at because it looks different from
the layout and resource XML files then
we've been used to seeing in other parts
of the app so I think it might be
helpful to provide you some context for
this file so every app must have an
Android manifest dot XML file with
exactly that name but luckily for us we
don't have to worry about creating one
so this file is automatically generated
whenever we create a new app in Android
studio you can think of this file as a
table of contents for your app let me
explain in a book like this we have a
table of contents that helps summarize
what's contained inside the book
similarly the manifest file summarizes
the import information about the whole
app in a single place when you install
your app on a device the Android system
first looks at this file before it runs
any of the code on your app so what is
contained in this file from the last
exercise you notice that all the
activities have to be listed in the
Android manifest file
well this manifest also contains other
important information such as the Java
package name which is the apps unique
identifier components of the app for
example the activity names intents
permissions for notifications or using
the camera and also it helps sets the
minimum Android API which means to
specify which versions of the Android
platform the app is compatible on so in
the Android manifest file forum you walk
up here's the package name and these are
the components of our app this points
the theme of our app this is where the
app theme from the styles.xml file is
applied to so that our app and satisfier
will be brown and this is where our icon
is specified in the all apps screen of
our device we see a basket as the app
I've gone for our Miwok app within the
Miwok app we have five activities listed
here within the main activity tag we
also see something called an intent
filter remember that an intent is a
message that requests some type of
action to be performed by another app in
turn apps can specify intent filters to
announce to other apps hey I can receive
a certain type of intent and perform an
action for you this attend filter with
the action main and category launcher
indicates that this is an entry point
into our app when a user taps on the
Miwok
PyCon in the device home screen Android
will send an intent to start our app
this activity will receive that intent
and open up the screen we'll have a
chance to practice modifying the
androidmanifest.xml later in this lesson
but for now let's go back to building
our app</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
