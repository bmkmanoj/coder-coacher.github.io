Solomon constructed a game with payoffs
okay would somehow are supposed to
capture what's really going on with the
mothers and based on the action was able
to kind of determine what their true
preferences were so really this was a
game about eliciting preferences hmm and
in fact that's exactly what you said you
said by their reactions by their
behavior King Solomon was able to figure
out that a preferred that the baby live
and have begin it him let's say him
while be preferred mainly that a not
have the baby hmm and by once getting
preferences and saying well you know
they don't those preferences only make
sense for the real mother and the fake
mother let's just go with that and so
now I can determine a the real mother is
okay right and King Solomon's wise now
i'm gonna make a claim which is that
this is insane and doesn't actually make
any sense ah so let me ask you this
Michael sure you're a rational kind of
guy I'm gone wise guy you're wise kind
of gave you definitely a wise guy let's
imagine that you were be lets say be
really is not the real baby mother they
will baby mama okay so b is not the real
mother but let's say that your be okay i
want to meet the king bit okay shooting
solomon you can be both in King Solomon
makes this offer I will cut the baby in
half okay what would should if your goal
is to keep the baby right or at least to
make certain a doesn't get the baby
right should you actually do alright
here's what I think you want me to say
but I'm not sure that I completely get
it so b is as wise as King Solomon
because game theory assumes we have
rational agents etc etc with infinite
processing power so b is at least as
smart as king solomon and so B says okay
King Solomon's going to use whatever I
say to decide whether or not on the real
mom and in particular if I say don't cut
the baby he'll think I'm the real mom so
B will cry out do not cut the baby no
and now King Solomon's back where he
started in that he has two identical
women and two identical reactions right
and so if both of them say
then King Solomon knows nothing ah but a
being an extremely rational person as
well says King Solomon will know that
the person who actually is not the mom
is going to say no facetiously and so
only the real mom would say yes cut the
baby in half no no no because of that
were true then the other thing would
then the story would make any sense Oh
actually this story doesn't make any
sense because first off the idea someone
would be lit would say oh you're gonna
cut the baby in half I'm fine with that
as if people be like that's a caring
mother that's just out of that big city
sense but we don't have to go we can
just talk about game theory in this
little matrix here and go the best
action for both of them is just both say
no all right wait so you're saying King
Solomon set up a kind of a mechanism
design problem or set up a mechanism
mm-hmm and it was a flawed mechanism
because if you understand the mechanism
you know the right thing to say is no
and so knowing then he has to flip a
coin to decide who gets the baby right
and then you know you're doing pretty ok
and that game certainly better than the
alternative which is to say yes think
about if your action in some sense is
either to say no or to say yes I'd wear
that's my baby or it's the other
person's baby the equilibrium here is
sort of both if the other person says no
there's no reason for you to say yes
right and the other person says yes then
you should say no right so that's a
dominant strategy it's actually just
it's a lot like chicken in their chicken
and air has this sort of thing where you
want to be the daring one if the other
ones the chicken this is like everyone
says no yeah okay fair enough but you
basically both want to say no there's no
circumstances under which you want to
say cut the baby in her errand that's
awesome yeah I mean so I mean the
problem with this of course is that none
of these people studied game theory so
they may be hadn't thought things
through and they were just giving their
original reaction well i'm pretty sure
that in the real world even people who
haven't studied game theory with know
better than to say sure cut the baby in
half it's just not socially acceptable</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
