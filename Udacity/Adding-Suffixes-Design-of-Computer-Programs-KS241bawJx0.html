back to our list of concepts and say
well what are we done so far and what's
next we think we did a good job with the
dictionary and we did a good job with
our hands here in terms of legal play
well we've got words so we're sort of
part way there but we haven't hooked up
the words to the board so maybe that's
the next thing to do say let's do a
better job of hooking up the letters in
the hand with the words in the
dictionary and place them in the right
place on the board I don't want to have
to deal with a whole board let's just
deal with one letter at a time so let's
say there's one letter on the board and
I have my hand and I want to say up I
can play wor and make up a word and just
to make it a little bit more satisfying
than one letter let's say that there's a
set of possible letters that are already
on the board and we can place our words
anywhere but we're not going to worry
about collisions and so on so we're not
going to worry about placing some
letters here and having them run off the
board we're not going to worry about
placing letters here and having them run
into another letter we're just going to
say what words can I make out of my hand
that connect with either a D or an X or
now and so I need a strategy for that
and let's just consider one letter at a
time so what I need to find is all the
plays that takes letters in my hand
let's say those are the seven letters in
my hand take those letters and combine
them with the D and find all the words
and so what kind of what can those words
consist of they can have some prefix
here which can be any prefix in our set
of prefixes that come solely from the
letters in my hand and then the letter D
that's already there doesn't have to
come from my hand and then some more
letters and so I'll think of this as a
prefix + a suffix where I make sure that
I know that the D is already there
here's word plays takes a hand and a set
of letters that are on the board and
it's going to find all possible words
that can be made from that hand
connecting to exactly one of the letters
on the board we're going to break it up
into a prefix that comes only from the
hand then the letter from the board and
then the remainder of the suffix that
comes from
and the same structure as we has before
we start off with an empty set of result
words in the end we're going to return
that set of result words then we're
going to go through all the possible
prefixes that come exclusively from the
hand then the possible letters on the
board and add a suffix to the prefix +
the letter on the board from the letters
in the hand except for we can no longer
use the letters in the prefix find
prefixes it's just like fine words
except we're collecting things that are
in the prefixes rather than things that
are in the list of words and now I want
you to write add suffixes so given a
hand a prefix that we found before
result set that you want to put things
into find me all the words that can be
made by adding on letters from the hand
into the prefix to create words</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
