let a user know when something was done
how does the user know that the action
has been completed so now now you're
gonna do the exchange
now you're exchanging with someone how
do you know when it's been completed you
know what's funny about these questions
is they seem obvious like duh right but
actually when you're the designer you
have to think about what happens that
shows it's done the numbers change does
anything else happen do they see the
numbers change if you views like some
Apple products sometimes like when you
delete something the little piece moves
into the trashcan
you know that's feedback right but it's
also feedback that showed what happened
like this thing didn't just disappear it
moved into this other folder that you
can actually go to</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
