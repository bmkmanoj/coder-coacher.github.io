periodic table little bit further so
earlier we came across another method of
dealing with classification which we
call top-down or established refine in
that method we had this classification
of hierarchy which start with the
concept establish it then refine it and
refine it further if needed that
particular control of processing is very
well suited for one kind of organization
of concepts it's very well suited for
one set of situations where we know
something already vertebrate we're
trying to establish whether it's a bird
or a bluebird in a different kind of
classification task a better control of
processing is to go bottom up let's look
at this a little bit more carefully here
are a number of leaf nodes and we know
the agent knows something about the
value for each of these leaf nodes and
the task is to make a prediction at the
root node so in this particular case
imagine the task of the agent is to
predict the future the dow jones
industrial average tomorrow it'll be
great to have an air agent like that if
we had a good agent like that you and I
could both become very rich now how
could this air agent make a prediction
about the Dow Jones Industrial Average
tomorrow but one way in which it could
do is it could look at the information
it has about the GDP in the inflation in
employment today but how does it nobody
in value of GDP of the inflation
unemployment today well it could look
then at the values of the overtime hours
the Consumer Sentiment Index new orders
index and so on and so forth now the
processing is largely bottom-up we know
something about the values of the
features that go into this concept and
they go into this concept they go to
this concert you can abstract them and
find the value of the gdp and similarly
for this and that abstracted further so
the controller processing in this
particular case we might call it
identify an abstract identify an
abstract bottom-up controller processing
are then pop down in the previous case
we have just defined to other elements
of a periodic table of of a growing
periodic table of intelligence and this
latter element the bottom of
classification the conditions of
application are different</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
