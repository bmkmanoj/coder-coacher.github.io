both the skin color and the disposition
appeared to be related in these families
as opposed to height doesn't appear to
be related and our first family now what
do we mean by this all I mean is that
when we look at the Sun here in the
first example he's much taller than the
parents both the parents are short so
we're asking the question where did the
trade of the Sun being tall come from
not only does it not appear to come from
either one of the parents individually
but doesn't look to be a combination of
the parents height either in the case of
skin color and disposition though we see
that both the daughter and the baby
share the same skin tone as the parents
so it appears as if that trait was
related in this case and the same thing
for disposition while one parent seems
to be sad most or all of the time the
children are happy and resemble what the
other parent looks like most of the time
which is having a happy or really cheery
disposition now it's really important to
remember as we go through this lesson
and all the lessons in this course just
because a trait appears to be related or
to be inherited in particular ways looks
can be deceiving sometimes and we'll
talk in great detail about what aspects
of traits have a genetic component in
which of those might have an
environmental component down the line</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
