search engine you can crawl the web
finding content from pages building an
index and then respond to search queries
with the pages that contain that content

ready to start my search company and so
I was looking at the competitors out
there and the keys you had to have a
catchy name so Google dr. go I got some
other really hard part so this is I'm
ready to enough I'm ready to share with
you my idea I've been putting a lot of
fun that's how about search with Peter
info yeah so there's a lot of work to do
I got to buy servers I got to get
employees investors I got a um I got to
start now okay well good like the Peter
there are some more things that we want
to learn in this class and there's some
things that we need to do to really
improve the search engine to make it
useful and unit five will work on making
the search engine faster and in unit six
we'll work on making it find the best
page for a given query not just all the
pages for the rest of this unit we're
gonna look at understanding more how the
internet works and what happens when we
request a page on the World Wide Web</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
