the previous example that I just showed
you that we should make concrete a good
function for scale detection has a one
stable sharp Peaks for example again the
same function that we looked at f and if
I actually was to trace this out this is
not a peak here this would be
problematic here has multiple peaks
would be problematic because I wouldn't
know which scale to choose this is the
kind of behavior you want we want to be
able to kind of see as a region size
gets bigger this function basically has
or gives me one peak again some of the
ideas here it basically suggests that we
can actually do this more normal images
a good function would be the one that
responds to the contrast or intensity
changes in an image remember all of this
still sounds a little abstract so let's
look at a few examples to make this a
bit concrete here's an example of the
same building at two different scales in
case this is an example of a zoomed up
image and now zoom doubt here basically
look at the scale and basically you look
at the function this is a nice peak here
this is the one we want to look at and
at the same scale level this is a
visible at this point so in essence now
we know need the two scales for these
two images this allows us to look at
scale and actually model the scale that
will allow us to make our detector
invariant to scale</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
