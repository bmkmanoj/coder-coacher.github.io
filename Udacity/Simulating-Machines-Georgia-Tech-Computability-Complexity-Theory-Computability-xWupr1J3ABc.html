machines can simulate multi tape ones I
want to warm up with a very simple
example to illustrate what we mean when
I say that one machine can simulate
another so let's consider what I'll call
stay-put machines these have the
capability of not moving their heads in
a computation step which Turing machines
as we defined them are not allowed to do
so the transition function now includes
an S for the direction which makes the
head stay put now this doesn't add any
computational capability to the machine
because I can accomplish the same things
with a normal Turing machine for every
transition where the head stays put we
can introduce a new state and just have
the head move one step to the right and
then one step back to the left
gamaheer means to match everything in
the tape alphabet and this puts the head
back in the spot it started in without
affecting the tapes contents except for
occasionally taking an extra movement
step this Turing machine will operate in
the same way as the stay-put machine
more precisely we say that two machines
are equivalent if they accept the same
inputs reject the same inputs and loop
on the same inputs if we consider the
tape to be part of the output equivalent
machines also need to halt with the same
tape contents note that other properties
of the machines such as the number of
states the tape alphabet or the number
of steps in any given computation do not
need to be the same just the
relationship between the input and the
output needs to be the same</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
