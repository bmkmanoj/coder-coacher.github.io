200 pairs of shoes in stock shoes are
selling fast because of the sale if the
company increases its shoe inventory by
twenty-five percent how many pairs of
shoes will the company have so the
company is going to be running out of
shoes if the company doesn't get any new
pairs of shoes they'll have a hundred
percent of their inventory their current
inventory is 200 so they'd have a
hundred percent of 200 I know that as a
decimal one hundred percent is just one
I divide by 100 and move the decimal
place left so i have 1 times 200 the
company doesn't want this if they just
have a hundred percent of the shoes the
inventory won't change and they'll run
out of shoes so in the last problem we
had a decrease our percentage because we
had a percent off but this time the
company wants to increase their
percentage let's see if you can figure
out what percentage of the pairs of
shoes you actually want to find</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
