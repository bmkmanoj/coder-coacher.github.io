introduction to artificial intelligence
I'll be teaching with the very very
basics today this is unit one of
artificial intelligence welcome the
purpose of this class is twofold number
one to teach you the very basics of
artificial intelligence so you'll be
able to talk to people in the field and
understand the basic tools of the trade
and also very importantly to excite you
about the field I have been in the field
of artificial intelligence for about 20
years and it's been truly rewarding so I
want you to participate in the beauty
and the excitement of AI so you can
become a professional who gets the same
reward and excitement out of this field
as I do the basic structure of this
class involves videos in which Peter or
I would teach you something new then
also quizzes in which we will ask you
about your ability to answer AI
questions and finally answer videos in
which we tell you what the right answer
would have been for the quiz that you
might have falsely or incorrectly
answered before this will be reiterated
and everyone says so often you get a
homework assignment also in the form of
quizzes but without the answers and then
we also have video exams a a I program
is called wetware a formula or an
intelligent agent pick the one that fits
best</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
