connected world the Google logo wasn't
always so polished and actually has a
rich typographic history the original
logo was created by Sergey Brin in GIMP
using a typeface called Baskerville Bolg
yeah that's right in GIMP now there was
even a time when the Google logo had an
exclamation point at the end like with
Yahoo roof kadar designed the logo we
see today but before the final design
was reached
she iterated on a whole bunch of ideas
the final word mark is set in the
Couture typeface using the primary
colors in green it's continued to evolve
over the past 16 years with minor
refinements and most recently a flutter
more simplified look and Google Doodles
have become a much anticipated part of
the google.com homepage but did you know
the idea for doodles came about when
Sergey and Larry wanted to mark the
occasion of attending Burning Man in
1988 the doodles a temporary marks that
denote holidays significant events or
figures the doodle stylistically makes
organic and inorganic objects and
figures to make the letter forms now
after viewing just a few of them thanks
to the Gestalt laws of grouping your
brain immediately recognizes even very
lyrical and stylized drawings as the
individual letters in the word Google
now material design utilizes these very
same principles and concepts to make it
easier for users to comprehend your UI
knowing all that will you look at the
Google logo the same ever again</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
