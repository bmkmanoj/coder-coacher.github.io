routing table at the source using the
school's approach to key based routing
we're in every step we are going half
the distance towards the desired
destination now reducing the distance
but exactly half may not always be
possible because I may not have a way to
reach that particular node so it is
approximately we're reducing the
distance by half so let's run through
this example to illustrate how the ski
based routing works so the XOR distance
between the source and the destination
is 10 so the target for my first hop is
going to be to a node that is 5 distant
from the desired destination the node
that is 5 distant from the desired
destination is no number one because the
XOR of 1 and 4 is 5 so this is my target
that is half the distance to my desired
destination but unfortunately I don't
have a direct way of reaching one
because I don't have that entry in my
routing table and therefore i'm going to
go to a node that is approximately half
the distance and I could have gone to
either 2 or 0 close to the desired half
the distance metric but to make forward
progress towards the desired destination
I will go to this guy who is for distant
from the desired destination so I make a
an RPC call to this node because I
cannot reach him I go to him and I'm
going to ask him hey I am looking for
someone who is too distant from my
desired destination which is four and
when I sent this request over to him he
responds to me and says look I have
information on three nodes that are not
exactly too distant but close enough for
five and seven are the nodes that I have
who are close enough to the two distant
neighbor that you're looking for the two
distant neighbor is this guy but even
this note that I am reaching that is for
distant from my desired destination he
doesn't know anyone that
too distant from the destination and so
he's going to respond to me and say I
don't have exactly what you're looking
for but I have information about nodes
four five and seven that are close
enough to who you're looking for that's
the information that I get back so when
I get the response from this node what
I'm getting back is information on how
to reach nodes number 4 5 &amp;amp; 7 so I am
now going to populate my routing table
to evolve it to this new state where it
shows that in addition to what I started
with originally I have now new
information about how to reach node
number 4 node number 5 which i already
had and load number seven which is a new
information I got so you can see that
from this I evolved this by adding two
more reachable entries in my routing
table namely the nodes four and seven so
what do I want to do next well the next
thing that I want to do is I want to go
to someone who's too distant from the
desired destination because I reduce the
distance by half and now I want to
reduce it even further by half that
means I want to get to a node that is
too distant from the desired destination
that is this guy right here but I don't
have a way of reaching him so I'm going
to go to a node that is close enough to
the desired target the target is too
distant from the desired destination I
don't have an entry for him I could
either go to the guy that is three
distant from the desired destination or
there is one distant from the desired
destination obviously I want to go
closer to the destination so I'm going
to go to this guy normally if I went to
the guy who was too distant from the
destination I would have asked him for
I'm looking for someone who is one
distant from the desired destination but
in this case it turns out that I've
already reached the guy that is one
distant because I did not have an entry
for the
guy who was too distant from the desired
destination so this guy is going to get
my request that says I'm looking for
somebody who is one distant from the
desired destination and he looks at his
and routing table and says these are the
nodes that I know satisfy the criteria
that you're looking for 4 5 &amp;amp; 7 that's
what I get back you notice one thing
that is happening here and that is after
my first hop I got back noo tidies 4 5 &amp;amp;
7 which are the response for my request
saying I'm looking for somebody who's
too distant from the desired destination
because he gave approximately the nodes
that are having that characteristic of
being too distant from the desired
destination including the node number
for itself so my table evolved at this
step with a direct way of reaching node
number four as well but notice that I'm
not being greedy here because in the
second step I want to reduce my distance
only by half from the first step and
that is I want to go to somebody who's
too distant from the desired destination
that's what I did and I got back this
response and when I get back that
response I'm going to populate my table
again but it turns out I did not get any
new information at this step because i
already have the information about 4 5 &amp;amp;
7 at the end of my first RPC call as
well now I have a way of reaching the
desired destination and in my conscience
I can feel good that I'm not being
greedy I can now the target is 0 and now
I can make that call directly to the
desired destination and get back the
response that I want so you can see that
in this corals key-based routing using
this idea of reducing my distance to my
desired destination by half at every hop
what it results in is the fact that the
latency that i am going to experience in
order to reach my desired destination is
increased because i have to take more
number of hops
in order to get to the desired
destination even if I have a direct way
of reaching my desired destination I am
NOT doing that I am actually reducing my
distance by half every time in order to
get to my desired destination and the
reason is i am placing common good more
important than my own latency i'm
avoiding the tree saturation that can
occur at the destination if everybody is
greedy that comes at the cost of
increased latency but that's okay what
we are shooting for is common good</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
