atomic read write operations on the lock
repeatedly even while waiting for the
lock is inefficient in terms of energy
and it actually slows down the thread
that is in the critical section we want
to make this more efficient and one way
of doing that is to do a so-called test
and atomic op approach in the locking
function so the original approach to
using for example an atomic exchange is
to set our one to one and as long as our
one is one try to swap it with lock bar
eventually we see a zero and we exit but
as we now know this keeps invalidating
everybody else who is waiting on the
lock so we are getting a lot of cache
misses while waiting and active waiting
like this is not only spending energy on
the bus transfers all the time but also
keeps the bus busy so that useful work
in other threads that are not busy
waiting is slow down so this is kind of
like a repeated atomic op approach to
make it more efficient what we do is we
do the same type of looping here but we
don't immediately try to swap what we do
first is use normal loads to wait for
lock were to become zero so the idea is
that we're using normal loads while aqua
is busy if we observe that it's free we
try to grab it by doing an atomic
exchange we cannot try to grab it using
the normal store that's why we have to
do the exchange but it is that there is
no point in trying to do the exchange
unless the lock is actually free and the
purpose of the exchange now is solely to
ensure that only one of us grabs the
lock once it becomes free but the busy
waiting while the lock is continuously
free is done using normal reads so now
if we have core 0 1 and 2 and core 0
succeeds in doing an exchange and gets
the locker in the modified State core
one will now reach this point and read
lock VAR see that it's one it's done
using a normal load so here we move to
the own state here we move to the shared
state
and there is a cash to cash transfer
here now we will keep doing this but
we'll keep getting cash hid so we no
longer access the bus while waiting
similarly corto will load the lock lure
it will also get the value and have it
in the shared state and i also get cash
kids while waiting so as long as score 0
keeps the lock busy here these two cores
are no longer generating bus traffic
support 0 basically gets the entire
coherence bus to itself so you can very
quickly service cache misses and cash
hits here are much more efficient than
bus accesses and this is going to
continue until core 0 releases the lock
at which point there is an invalidation
and these two will read again see a
value of one try to compete for it using
the exchange and so on but those bursts
of activity really happen only when
they're actually trying to acquire the
lock as long as the lock is really busy
they just keep using normal loads in
this loop so this is much more energy
efficient</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
