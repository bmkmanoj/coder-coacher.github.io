structure we want to create a dictionary
that contains the heck semesters as the
keys and the values as a list of each
course a given person is involved with
so let's look at Dave for April 2012
he's involved in two courses cs101 his
intro course and CS 387 the applied
cryptography course and the dictionary
continues on but the structure stays the
same where the key is the heck semester
and the value is a list of courses for
which that person is involved so one
question you may be asking yourself what
does it mean to be involved and if we go
back to our data structure what we're
going to do is look at the name value
pairs associated with the course so if
we're looking for Steve Steve is
associated with his class CS 253 the web
engineering building a blog and so
that's what we're going to do we're
going to go through each course looking
at the value in the name value pairs and
if the value is what we're looking for
then we're going to add that course to
our dictionary associated with the key
of that heck semester it sounds a little
convoluted and the answer is a little
long but it's really a simple idea the
first thing I'm doing is creating the
output dictionary we're going to go
through each heck semester we're going
to go through each course in each heck
semester we're going to go through each
key in the name value pairs if the value
associated with all this is the person
we're looking for then we're going to
update our output dictionary if we've
already added this heck semester as a
key to the output dictionary then we're
just going to append this course at the
end of the list associated with that
heck semester otherwise we're going to
create a new list for which the course
is the sole value and once we're done
with all these four loops we're going to
return our output dictionary</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
