to go back to Xcode and open up the Mays
project once you have it open I want you
to navigate to the move dots with four
it's located under Mays under-the-hood
Mays moves and then move dot Swift this
is where we describe the move struct but
it's just a single file and that seems a
little confusing since the robot is
moving more than once don't we need more
than one move struct or more than one
move dot Swift file the answer is no
think back to the analogies we used like
engine blueprints and the blueprints a
particular component was defined only
once but actual instances of the
component will physically exist in tens
and thousands of actual engines and
that's what this file is it's like the
blueprint for the move struct we create
this single blueprint as we can see here
in the movie Swift file and then we can
create many instances of the move struct
in our application in programming lingo
we'd call this blueprint a definition or
we would say that in the movie Swift
file we define the move strut</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
