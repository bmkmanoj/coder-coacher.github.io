enough information to kind of chew on it
a little bit maybe so let's see I have I
guess K hypotheses I have to choose from
I know that basically you always return
the output of one I don't get to choose
what those examples are they're drawn
from from some distribution right and I
want to know whether I'm gonna need to
see another of examples that are
polynomial in the error that I'm
interested in with a certainty that I'm
interested in and I gotta be able to
come up with an algorithm learning
algorithm that will do that exactly so
what do you think I want to say the
answer is yes all right so how would you
argue that though like you have a
particularly out rhythm in mind well I
was actually I actually did I was going
to basically keep all the hypotheses
that are consistent with the data that
I've seen okay all right and what is
that called
the version space right okay all right
so keep track of that and then whenever
I stopped getting samples I have to pick
one of those so I'm just going to pick
one of them uniformly okay well that
seems good so far we could pick one
uniformly so what makes you think that
that's actually going to be able to
return the right answer or a close
enough answer with not that much data
like how do we actually bound the number
of samples that we need to make it so
that when we pick uniformly we actually
get a good answer well it's a little
hard I mean my intuition is that given
that we don't know what the the concept
is only the class that it comes from if
I do anything other than choose
uniformly then I can be very unlucky
I basically uniformly basically means in
this case I don't know anything else to
do so there's sort of no better
algorithm than the one that we just came
up with which is find all the hypotheses
that are consistent and you have no
reason to choose one over the other
because you don't have any more data so
you should just close your eyes and pick
one and if you do anything else
then in the absence of some specific
domain knowledge that tells you to do
otherwise you know you can just
basically end up being very unlucky so I
agree with you and this is a good
algorithm but we do what we lack at the
moment is an argument as to why the
number of samples that it needs isn't
exponential right because there's an
exponentially
you know 2 to the K different possible
inputs if we had to see all of them to
be able to guess right that would be too
many so we really want it to be a you
know a polynomial in K not an
exponential in K so I'm gonna say that
we don't have enough background yet to
be able to answer this definitively the
yes is the right answer but we're gonna
need to dive in a little bit more deeply
and develop some more concepts to be
able to argue why that's the right
answer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
