be able to figure this out here is that
if the boolean formula has a satisfying
assignment then a shortest path from A
to B that visits all vertices can visit
each of these vertices by basically
paying just one extra edge so instead of
going this way we have to go this way
exactly once for each clause so the
length of the shortest path from A to B
that visits all vertices is the same as
the shortest path from A to B that does
not visit the clause vertices plus M
because we have to pay one extra edge
for each clause vertex that we visit
here so it's something plus M and we
know that there is a path between a and
B that visits each vertex exactly once
and so the path lengths from e to be is
almost the same as the number of
vertices it's just one less so you can
see this here in the example if I have
two vertices then the shortest path
between those vertices is one so one
less if I go one two three four five
vertices and the path has length 4 and
so on so what we have here is 5 n plus 3
mm plus 1 and then we have to add em so
our total here is 5 n plus M plus 3 MN
plus 1 and now we are almost done so we
have shown that if the boolean formula
has a satisfying assignment then the
length of the shortest path from A to B
that visits all vertices has length 5 n
plus M plus 3 MN plus 1 where n is the
number of variables and M is the number
of clauses now we also have to show the
other direction of course so if there is
a shortest path between a and B of
length 5 n plus M plus 3 MN plus 1 then
each clause in the boolean formula can
be satisfied so we have a satisfying
assignment right now we have shown that
if the boolean formula is satisfied then
we have a path of this length and now we
need to show the other direction as well
of course if we have a path of this
length then the boolean formula has a
satisfying assignment why do we need to
show those two directions
because the requirement for reduction is
that our new instance that we
constructed here is a yes instance if
and only if this boolean formula appear
has a satisfying assignment so right now
we have shown the if and now we need to
show the only if but this is actually
quite easy because if we know that there
is a path between a and B of this length
here then we already know that each
vertex is visited exactly once because
this is the bare minimum of eight or
between a and B given this many vertices
secondly we know that the tour will
correspond to a variable assignment so
it will correspond to an assignment of
true and false to these vertices here
because otherwise we would visit a city
more than once we've already shown that
and finally we have also shown that each
class can be satisfied because we can
only visit a vertex down here like that
with paying just one extra edge if the
assignment up here corresponds to a
satisfying assignment and now we are
almost done in showing that shortest
tour is np-complete I don't know if you
notice but there's one small detail
missing right now we are only going from
A to B and we're asking for a shortest
path from A to B we are not asking for
shortest tour yet but that is actually
quite easy to fix we'll just remove this
vertex be here and make this edge very
very very very long over here and then
it's not the length of the shortest path
from A to B anymore but it's the length
of the shortest tour and of course that
length is only true if and only if the
boolean formula is satisfiable and we're
done we have reduced SAT to shortest
tour we have shown that shortest tour is
in NP so now our final conclusion this
problem here is np-complete of course
it's a bit ironic that showing that
problems such as shortest tour is
np-complete can sometimes feel like
solving an np-complete problem in itself
that's why I would now like to show you
how to even further simplify that
problems are np-complete</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
