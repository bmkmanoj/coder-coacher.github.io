related that either all of them lie here
in NP but not in P or all of them lie in
p we don't know which one it is but it
can be the case that for example we have
just vertex cover and P and the other
two problems here in NP and how did we
show that in the last unit four clique
and independent set we showed that there
was a polynomial time algorithm that
could take a graph that was an input to
independent set and transform that into
a graph that we can use in as an input
for click and once we have solved the
clique problem on the transformed graph
that same solution is also the best
possible solution to independent set so
we have a polynomial time algorithm so
the algorithm transforms the input of
one problem say X into an input of
another problem why so for example we
take independent set and transform that
graph into an input for click and now
you'll see one of the advantages of
working with decision problems because
the third condition is rather easy to
state because we can now simply say that
solving the problem why on the
transformed input yields the same answer
as solving the original problem on the
original input so these three statements
you're out the same thing that you have
seen in the last unit so we took an
input which was a graph to independent
set then transformed it into an input
for click and we found out if we solve
click on that new input then we would
get the same answer that we would have
gotten if we had solved independent set
directly on the original input and of
course we also saw that the
transformation worked in the other way
so we could transform an input to click
into an input of independent set and now
for vertex cover an independent said it
was even easier because we didn't even
have to transform the input so basically
the transformation was we could keep the
input as it is the only thing is if
we're working with the decision problem
of course the answer will be a little
bit different so if we have a vertex
cover of size K for a graph with n
vertices then for independent set we
must ask if we have an independent set
of size and minus K but other than that
the transformation here is very easy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
