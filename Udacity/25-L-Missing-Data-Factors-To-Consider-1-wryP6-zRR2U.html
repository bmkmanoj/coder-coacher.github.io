consider when dealing with missing data
and the answers to some of these
questions might guide us in what
methodology might be the best approach
for example one question to consider is
just how much data is really missing as
we saw from our example deleting all the
records with any missing data eliminate
a full one half of our total data this
would obviously not be an acceptable
solution however what if we were working
with 10,000 observations and had missing
values in just 200 of them since that
means that we could effectively keep
ninety-eight percent of our records even
after eliminating those missing data
then in this situation this deletion
method might be appropriate another
question to ask is how the missing data
is distributed across the data set as we
can recall from our example we had
missing data in all of our variables
whether the majority of what's missing
is in a smaller subset of the variables
available will help guide us on how to
work with them an example of this would
be if we had data with 10 different
predictor variables if most of the
missing values were predominantly in
just two of these 10 then we could deal
with them on a variable x variable basis
one question to consider would be
whether those specific variables are
actually significant to our analysis and
model making process referring back to
our example if home ownership wasn't
readily relevant to our business
question the fact that we have some
missing data for that variable won't
really matter and in fact we might want
to just eliminate that one variable
entirely from consideration for our
model and one further question that we
might use to consider our approach is
whether the variable in question with
the missing data is numeric or
categorical an example of this from our
survey sample is the education variable
it's not quite that simple to imputing
up with an average education level might
be a bit more
flex so this could limit our approach</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
