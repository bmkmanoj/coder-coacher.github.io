on in this question the end of the day
we want to know how much we have to pay
well that's a question of money and
money shows up here it's six dollars for
each 24 ounce package of chicken links
ok so i guess it means annie's know how
many 24 ounce packages i need which
means i need to figure out how much
chicken I need to order ok well the
first thing I want to do is figure out
how many pounds i'm going to have to
order and then i'm getting point 3
pounds per person which i can write like
this and that there's 60 people so i'm
going to multiply by 60 people well
person people same thing i'm going to
cancel out so i have 60 x 0.3 and the
only unit left is pounds and this works
out to 18 pounds ok so i need to buy 18
pounds of chicken how many ounces is
that looks like i need to convert two
ounces to figure out how many of these
packages i have to buy well i'm going to
multiply by my conversion factor which
is going to be 16 ounces / 1 pound again
my units cancel i'm left with 18 x 16
ounces plug that into my calculator and
i find that i need two hundred and
eighty eight ounces of chicken wings and
i should point out that normally I'd be
doing this all on separate lines and
that's how you should be doing it in
your book I just want to make sure this
all stays in the same page so I'm being
a little bit sloppier than I normally
should be so we need two hundred an
eighty eight ounces of chicken how many
packages is that well I could just think
of this is dividing 288 by 24 and that
would give me the answer but as long as
we're thinking in terms of conversion
factors I want to write it like this x 1
package over 24 ounces of chicken and
again units cancel ounces of chicken go
away but now i have to multiply by 1
over 24 which again is just like
dividing by 24 and the unit i have left
his package so i get 12 packages of
chicken now how much you have to pay
well it's six dollars per package i can
even think of that as being a conversion
factor
package cancels and i'm left with $72
and that's the answer you should have
gotten and if you didn't believe me I
understand there was a lot going on here
I would rewatch this video and see if
you can make sense of all of the
different uses of conversion factors
because there were a ton in here once
you can get to the point where you can
answer this question without seeing the
solution video well you're good to go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
