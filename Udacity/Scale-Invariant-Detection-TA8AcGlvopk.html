come up that actually makes our feature
detection invariant to scale let's take
the same examples of these two shapes
again you can tell that they are the
same just scaled up and of course I kind
of look at this window it basically says
that this is an edge of course when I
look at this window it comes across as a
corner so one thing I can do now is
start looking at different regions so
basically consider this region a circle
and they start looking at at different
sizes around the same point so in
essence what I'm doing now is I'm
zooming out I'm a kind of wanting to
look at the same region but from farther
away which actually would start making
this object start smaller so I try out
another region a circle no that doesn't
work let me try out at the same point
another larger one and if I keep going
and let's say I get to this scale all of
a sudden this detector is going to fire
this to be a point that's a corner just
like this so in essence by scaling up my
detector regions I can actually
accomplish exactly what this one is
doing and in essence what that comes out
to is now I would actually have
scale-invariant matching so in this
basic idea here is the region of
corresponding sizes will look the same
in both images as long as I can come up
with that scale so this does require a
little bit of kind of coming up at the
process that lets me find the right size
of the view region that would let me
compare this scale to this one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
