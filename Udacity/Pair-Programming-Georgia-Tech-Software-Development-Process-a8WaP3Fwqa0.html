very important one in XP and also one it
is kind of controversial and it's the
practice of pair programming what does
it mean it means that all production
code is written with two people looking
at one machine and notice that they're
working with one keyboard and one Mouse
so they're not just interfering and
writing on each other's code and the way
in which that happens is by playing
different roles at different times so
the two developers alternate between the
role of programming and strategizing
we're strategizing means for example
looking at the code that is being
written and thinking whether that would
work or what other tests that are not
there might not work given the way the
code is being written or maybe looking
at the code from it slightly detached
perspective and trying to figure out
whether the code can be made simpler
more maintainable more efficient and
interestingly there are measurements
there are studies that suggest the
development productivity with pair
programming is similar to that of two
people working independently and their
answers one of the main objections
against pair programming which is why
should I put two developers together
which is going to cut their productivity
in half it is not studies shows that
that does not happen and that the
resulting code can actually benefit from
the fact that two developers are working
together</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
