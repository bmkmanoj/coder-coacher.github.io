programming model say that I wanted to
count the number of occurrences of each
word that appears at least once in a
document let's use the text of Alice in
Wonderland here's a bit of text that
says Alice was beginning to get very
tired of sitting by her sister on the
bank and of having nothing to do if I
wanted to solve this problem without
MapReduce I might create a Python
dictionary consisting of all the words
and their counts I could go through the
document and say for each word in the
document if there's a key for that word
add one otherwise set the initial value
for that key equal to one and instead of
applying it to this short sentence
fragment from the book we'd apply it to
the entire book before we solve this
problem with MapReduce why don't you try
to write a Python script along the lines
of what we just discussed that will get
the job done
given many lines of a text create a
dictionary with a key for each word and
a value corresponding to the count of
the word in that text note that we want
the words to be stripped of any
capitalization and punctuation we just
want the basic words here's some code to
get you started first we import Sisson
string and then we initialize an empty
dictionary which will hold our words and
values we cycle through the lines of the
input and for each line we create an
array data which is essentially all of
the words in that line split by
whitespace so if we started with this
line hello how are you it would become
hello how are and you in an array of
length for your code should go here
after we split the line by whitespace
and before we print out the dictionary</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
