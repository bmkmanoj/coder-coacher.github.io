situation awareness applications is that
a computation may need to get
correspondingly time-stamped items from
several different sensor sources so for
instance in this picture I'm showing a
video source and audio source a text
source and gesture source and this
computation in order to do its
high-level inferencing it wants to use
the multiple modalities of sensing
that's available to generate higher
level inference that can be more robust
and this is where bundling of streams
that pts allows comes in handy pts
allows streams to be grouped together as
a stream group and any number of such
streams can be grouped together and and
labeled as a group and in creating a
stream bundle like this a computation
can specify that for this stream group
this guy is the anchor stream for
instance we could name the video as the
anchor stream for this particular stream
group all the other streams within the
same stream group are dependent streams
on the anchor stream and in PTS there is
a primitive for getting a group yet
saying get corresponding time-stamped
items from all of the streams in a
particular stream group the group get
primitive is once again a way of
reducing the pain point for a domain
expert and having to go out and fetch
individual items from each one of these
streams and selecting temporally
correlated items from all the other
dependent streams that burden is taken
away by pts but providing this group get
where you can get correspondingly
time-stamped items from all the streams
in a given group</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
