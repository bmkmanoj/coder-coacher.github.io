would be to go through and try and
determine what are the potential sources
of error in this experiment well first
our whole experiment was based on the
assumption that the earth is a sphere we
also use the assumption that the sun's
rays arrive at the earth parallel in
different locations and we justified
this by saying that the Sun is so far
away those rays must be coming nearly
parallel next we have the fact that the
sun's rays were vertical in CNA
we also have to measure the angle of the
sun's rays in Alexandria this is that
angle that we call to alpha and finally
we have to measure the distance between
CNA and Alexandria now these are the
five steps or assumptions that I
identified for this problem there could
be others that you may have identified
but these are the ones that I think are
most important if any of these were
incorrect so for example if the earth
wasn't really a sphere well that would
throw off our entire geometry
calculation likewise if the sun's rays
didn't arrive exactly in parallel or if
they weren't exactly vertical in CNA any
problem in any of these steps would of
course lead to error which would
propagate through our experiment and
show up as an error in our circumference
calculation let's go through each of
these potential sources of error and
quantify how much we think it may have
contributed to the error of our final
calculation step 1
earth is a sphere turns out the earth
isn't a perfect sphere it's actually
what's known as an oblate spheroid
which is a much cooler name but all it
means is that it's a little fatter
around the middle it turns out that this
difference is so so tiny that this
wouldn't really introduce any actual
error into our calculation barely even
measurable so I'm gonna call this
potential source of error as negligible
next we assume that the sun's rays
arrived parallel which means that the
Rays which strike CNA actually strike
parallel to those striking Alexandria it
turns out this is not exactly true the
Rays are not perfectly parallel for a
homework problem you'll actually
calculate how much error this will
contribute to our measurement of the
circumference or to our calculation of
the circumference but
I'll tell you for now that it's
negligible next we have this idea that
the sun's rays are arriving vertically
in siene now this seems like it could be
a potential source of error now let's
think of how Eratosthenes came to this
conclusion that the sun's rays were
perfectly vertical in siene on the
summer solstice</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
