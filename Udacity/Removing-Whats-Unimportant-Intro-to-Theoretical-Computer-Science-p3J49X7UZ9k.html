with algorithm B I guess there were
certain parts of the running time that
you did have a look at and that you base
your comparison on and there were other
parts that you ignore it so the parts
that you probably ignored are the plus
10 and the plus 256 because those are
just constants that we add to the
running time function and also when we
compare the function we didn't really
care about the minus N or the minus 50 n
because we just looked at the growth of
the two to the power of n versus three
and squared and even that three here is
not that important because if we had say
five N squared here or six N squared or
even 100 N squared 2 to the power of n
would still grow much faster and this is
why in theoretical computer science we
use a notation called Big O notation
that leaves away all those things that
we didn't really care about when
comparing the algorithms</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
