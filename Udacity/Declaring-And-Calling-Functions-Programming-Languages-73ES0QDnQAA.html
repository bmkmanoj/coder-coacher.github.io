puts us in a perfect place to write
interpreter code for declaring and
calling functions however there's a lot
more to functions than just environments
for example someone could be a little
mean and give us a procedure like this
to try to interpret mean of X
immediately returns X but then after
that it has written print a thousand and
one nights we should never actually
print out a thousand and one nights from
this function definition we should
return first now that's a shame because
a thousand and one nights is perhaps the
best known example of Arabic literature
collection of Middle Eastern and South
Asian stories one of my particular
favorite parts are the stories involving
Sinbad the sailor unfortunately his luck
fluctuates wildly more on Sinbad perhaps
later on the meaning of this is we need
a way to return without doing any more
work let's get a better feel for this
with a bit of a puzzle here I've written
a bit of Python code and I have for
assignment statements involving X what
I'd like you to do is imagine that these
assignment statements are not there but
you get to add one of them in and your
goal is to try to add in a statement
that will prevent us from printing out
Sinbad so again assume these statements
aren't there but which ones could you
move in to prevent Sinbad from being
printed multiple multiple choice check
all that apply</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
