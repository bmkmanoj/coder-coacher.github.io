do with exponents or powers when we have
log base B of X to the a we can really
set that equal to a times log base B of
X in other words we just take this
exponent of a and we bring it down in
front of our logarithm as a coefficient
in other words if I had log of base 10
of a hundred to the third power we can
rewrite this we can bring this third
power down in front of our logarithm so
we'll have three times the logarithm of
base 10 of 100 now I usually put this in
parenthesis so I understand that it's
three times this quantity and let's
carry out the math on both sides of the
equation to make sure that this makes
sense on the left hand side we'll have
log of base 10 and then a hundred to the
third power well a hundred to the third
power is the same thing as a million
that's one followed by six zeros on the
left hand side we'll help three times
the log base 10 of a hundred log base 10
of a hundred is 2 we know this since 10
squared equals 100 we're looking for the
exponent that we'd raise 10 to in order
to get this number so we know 3 times 2
equals 6 and now let's check the
left-hand side we'll have log base 10 of
a million well we know what million is 1
followed by six zeros so that means we
have to raise 10 to the sixth power in
order to get a million so yes 6 equals 6
this is just one example of why this log
property holds true and finally here's
the last logarithm property we'll
examine if we subtract two logarithms
that have the same base then we could
just divide the two numbers so the log
with base B of X minus the log of base B
of y equals the log base B of X divided
by Y for example the log of base 3 of 81
minus the log of base 3 of 9 would equal
at the log of base 3 of 81 divided by 9
we simply just divide these two numbers
inside of our argument and take the log
of it and let's also be sure that this
checks
we know the log of base 3 of 81 equals 4
since 3 to the 4th equals 81 we also
know the log of base 3 of 9 equals 2
since 3 squared equals 9 and finally on
the right hand side we'll have the log
of base 3 of 81 divided by 9 we know 81
divided by 9
really equals 9 so we have log with base
3 of 9 now we can just subtract here so
we get 2 equal to 2 we know log of base
3 of 9 is really just 2 as before now
using those log properties I want you to
try and write this expression with 1
logarithm in other words you should have
the log with base B of one number here
now it's ok if you're not entirely sure
what to do I just want you to try your
best think back to what it means when
you add logs together and when you
subtract laws together do them one at a
time and I think you might get to the
answer and again it's totally ok if you
don't get there you can always see the
solution</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
