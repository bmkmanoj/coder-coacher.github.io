by not doing this thing over here anyone
so here's what I'm proposing we do now
we take all of the data all that
training gear we have the XY 1 XY 2 dot
XY N and we put it in a database ha and
then next time we get some new X to look
at we just look it up in the database
and we're done
none of this fancy schmancy learning
none of this you know producing an
appropriate function like you know W X
plus B or whatever the equation of a
line is none of that fancy stuff anymore
we just stick it in a database people
written database programs before we look
it up when we're done we're done period
I feel like you've changed the paradigm
yes I'm a paradigm changer so what do
you think it's like it's disruptive it's
going to throw off the markets yeah it's
going to change everything so what do
you think well I mean so there's a bunch
of really cool things about this idea
which is why I'm excited so one is it
you know it doesn't forget right so it
actually is very reliable it very
dependable right so if you put in an XY
pair and you ask for the X you're going
to get that Y back instead of some kind
of you know crackpot e smooth version of
it right so we don't yeah that's a good
point so we look at this little blue
line over here you'll notice that say
for this little X over here we're not
going to get back what we put in so it
remembers it's like an elephant good so
that's kind of cool another thing is
that there's none of this wasted time
you know doing learning it just takes
the data in it and it's very rapidly
just puts it in the database so it's
fast its fastest like that I like it
when you say nice things about my
algorithms ok so it's fast anything else
Shh yeah I could think of one more thing
at least which is that like you it's
simple ha ha that's true I am simple I'm
simple and straightforward I just need a
few things to make me happy bacon bacon
and chocolate oh nice have you ever had
a chocolate-covered bacon that seems
wrong you know you would think so but it
turns out it's delicious it's like if
you take fat and sugar
and you put it together somehow you like
it I'm not making this up you can buy
chocolate-covered bacon your unsurprised
to here
in America okay so we've got three good
things it remembers stuff so you know
none of this little noisy throwing away
information it's very fast you just
stick it in a database using your
favorite database and looking up it's
going to be equally as fast and it's
very simple there's really no
interesting learning going on here so
it's the perfect algorithm and we're
done okay I mean it it feels like
there's more that we need to say though
like what in particularly the way that
you wrote this f of X equals lookup of X
if I give you one of the other points in
between then it will return no no such
point found which means it's it's really
quite conservative it's not willing to
go out on a limb and say well I haven't
seen this before but it ought to be
around here instead it just says I don't
know hmm so the downside of remembering
is no generalization okay
and I guess a similar sort of issue is
that when would you call it memorization
it makes it reminds me of the issues
that we saw with regard to overfitting
so it bottles the noise exactly it
models exactly what it was given so it's
going to be very sensitive to noise so
it's kind of a yes and no so that's a
little scary and they can over fit in a
couple of ways right it could over fit
by believing the data too much
that is literally believing all of it
and what do you do if you have a cup and
speaking of noise what if you have you
know a couple of examples that are all
the same so I've got an X shows up
multiple times but each time with a
different y ou the same X ah yeah so
then look up would return two different
things and this algorithm or whatever
that you've described so far wouldn't
commit to either of them and it would
just say hey here's both yeah that seems
problematic okay all right but I feel
like you know you're going to tell me
how to fix those things so I wasn't too
worried yet yeah well there's got to be
a nice way of fixing it I think that
there's sort of a basic problem here
which is that we're taking this this
remembering and then looking up a little
too literally right so I stick in the
data and I can get back exactly the data
that I got but I can't get back anything
that I don't have and that seems like
something we might be able to overcome
if we're just a little bit clever so
let's see if we can be a little bit
clever</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
