to talk about I have to admit it's a
little bit tricky it will require some
serious focus and it's something I was
never shown in school but after having
seen this what I'm about to show you I
had to say my mind was fairly blown so
just for some anticipation i want to
show you what we have we have one
dimensional motion we have a mass moving
back and forth in a straight line on a
spring I don't see any right triangles
here do you I don't think so yet what
we're going to get pretty soon is an
entirely new way of looking at
trigonometry the science of right
triangles this graph is a graph of
position versus velocity so on the
x-axis here we have position and I've
divided by x max the maximum possible
position so if I were to put a dot here
that would mean that at some point in
time the mass was all the way at the
maximum possible position that's why
this number is one and notice that I've
put it here I didn't put the dot here or
here and that's because on the vertical
axis I have velocity here velocity can
be as much as positive V Max which we
calculated earlier or negative V Max
positive this way- that way but we know
that for the instant when the block is
over here its velocity is equal to zero
it stops for that instant before it gets
pulled back towards equilibrium okay so
this is a point on a graph of position
versus velocity let's see if we can fill
out some more points I promise you we
are going to see something very
interesting I've given you four possible
suggestions for points that should exist
on this graph can you select the
appropriate one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
