paste the data into a new spreadsheet
and then try and find the average number
of Facebook friends hmm okay link to you
- Ian's Facebook friends equals ah
I can't type anything okay whoa copy and
paste the data into your own spreadsheet
how do I do that
Oh from Google Drive looks like I have
to sign in I can go to create
spreadsheet let's call this the same
thing that says here this way I can
reference back to this in the future
okay so I have to copy and paste the
data edit ah
copies not there I'm gonna copy it by
brute force command C maybe I'll just
try copying the data command C command V
yeah it worked
what's something else I could have done
file maybe download as Microsoft Excel
hey maybe this will work it did I have
an exact copy of the data and I can do
the exact same thing in Microsoft Excel
well I think I'll use Google Docs for
now dududuu to do oh no I accidentally
clicked on it and it's gone but here it
is in my drive from your Google account
you can see all the options here at the
top and here's my spreadsheet let's get
to know this spreadsheet this is cell a1
this is cell a2 each cell has a name
just like you and me except we usually
don't have numbers in our names there's
no comma or special characters in the
name of the cell and it's always the
letter first and then the number what do
you think this cell is let's put a
header on this data so we know what it
is
insert row above this is the header and
is not part of the data it just tells us
what we're measuring so that means the
data is from cell a2 to a 28
I wonder what cool stuff we could do
with this data
how about data sort range Oh data has
hetero
I almost said dater has hetero sort by
number of Facebook friends indeed what
else could we do what's this that looks
like Sigma sum here a bunch of functions
let's add them it automatically put the
formula here we could have written that
ourselves though and not been so lazy
actually let's do some formulas let's
calculate the average equals average a2
because that's where our data starts all
the way to a 28 cool and then we can see
here in the formula bar what we just
typed let's find the deviation from the
mean there's no formula for that you
just have to intuitively know what it is
deviation meaning how far something
differs from the mean how far each value
differs from the mean how do we find the
difference by subtracting and how do we
start our formulas with an equals a2
minus and now we always want this value
to be constant so instead of just
writing II 1 we're going to put a dollar
sign in between the letter and the
number that'll keep it constant when we
copy and paste this for the other cells
so that makes sense right zero minus
five hundred eighty four point blah blah
blah should be negative five eighty four
point blah blah blah so now there are a
few things we can do we can go to this
corner here where there's a plus sign
and drag it down and then we get each
deviation from the mean in fact if we
click on it we see in the formula bar
this is a ten here
minus the mean which is e one another
thing we could do is click on this cell
push command C or if you're on a PC
control C go to cell a2 push command
down go to cell b28
push command shift up and then that area
is highlighted and then push command V
what's the sum of the deviations equals
sum B 2 : b 28 it's like zero it should
always be about zero let's name this
column deviations X I minus X bar and X
bar is the mean okay let's do squared
deviations that's pretty
self-explanatory it's just the
deviations squared equals b2 squared now
again command C go to cell b2 command
down go to cell C 28 command shift up
command V I'm telling you if you get
used to those keyboard shortcuts you'll
be able to do things way fast especially
if you have a list of 500 data values it
might be easier for short data sets to
just drag this down but for large data
sets these keyboard shortcuts will make
your life a lot easier so now we have
our squared deviations let's find the
sum of squares equals sum C 2 : c 28
error
I must have typed something wrong let's
look and see what I did
oh there's a comma right there let's
delete it now we get the sum of squares
or SS let's find the variance that's
simply the sum of squares divided by N
equals C 30 divided by and it looks like
there are 27
values this goes until c28 but there's a
header here so it's not using one of the
cells so there are only 27 values cool
so this is the variance should probably
write this down just so you remember oh
and look it says all changes saved in
Drive every change you make is
automatically saved in Drive that is so
awesome I love Google Docs notice that
for variance we divided by n but if we
were treating this as a sample we would
divide by n minus 1 okay let's find the
standard deviation equals square root of
C 31 so here is the standard deviation
which remember it's represented by that
Greek symbol Sigma what if someone had a
lot of Facebook friends like a hundred
thousand how would that change our mean
standard deviation and variance let's
say that instead of having four hundred
eight Facebook friends he has 100
thousand ready for this whoa everything
changed automatically the deviations are
huge because the mean is huge and the
squared deviations are huge and
everything's huge that's so cool and
then you don't have to do anything
different what if everybody had zero
Facebook friends then everything's just
zero our spreadsheets totally awesome or
what</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
