kernel density estimate we could use
multivariate density estimates
multivariate kernel density estimates
will give us joint probability density
functions from which we can draw
conditional probabilities in this case
we can use another second variable
denoted as X bar which could be the
difference between F 0 and F 2 divided
by F 0 this will then be the difference
of the submitted charge amount and the
Medicare allowed amount divided by the
submitted charge amount let's take a
look at what the kernel density estimate
for the Joint Distribution of X and x
bar looks like back to your ipython
notebook we have defined a new variable
called X bar which is the absolute value
of the difference between f naught and F
2 divided by F naught we can use a very
convenient joint
plot function included in C born to make
that joint kernel density estimate of
the variables X and X bar let's run this
piece of code this might take a while to
run the star here indicates that the
computer is still working on your plot
have patience and you will get a nice
looking figure once that code finishes
running you will get a two-dimensional
plot looking like this on each axis we
have plotted the one-dimensional PDFs
the joint distribution is given as this
heat map here looking at the joint PDF
you can see that there is a cluster
around the point 0 0 there's also
another one around 0.8 there could be
another cluster somewhere around 0.6
you can ask several different questions
after you have a joint KDE notice that
the multivariate kernel density
estimation was made behind the scene
and all you see is the plot of the
probability density you can use
multivariate cadiz to do regressions you
can also use them to do pattern
classification using Bayes decision
rules the usefulness of cádiz is also
to determine the shape of the data very
quickly without having to collect a lot
of data and can be used for online
models and high velocity data in the
next lessons we are going to look at
some ways to determine if we have
outliers in the data we covered a little
bit of kernel density estimates as part
of nonparametric methods in statistics
however the subject is really vast we
recommend the book all of nonparametric
statistics by larry Wasserman if you
want to learn more about this subject a
link to the book is given in the
instructors notes in the next lesson
we're going to look at a simple way to
see if there are outliers in our data</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
