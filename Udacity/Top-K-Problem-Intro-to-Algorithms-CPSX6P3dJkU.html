interesting problem called the top k
problem so here's the idea
imagine we've got our list of values L
and there's n values in the list we can
compute the max or the second max second
largest just like we've been doing but
in some sense that doesn't really give
you a very representative sample of what
the list is about sometimes it's nice to
have a bit more so let's imagine that
this list is sorted though turns out it
won't have to actually be sorted and
imagine that we're going to focus in on
just the the ones that would be at the
the best the K best out of the n it
could be the case smallest or the K
largest depending on the particular
application that that you're considering
but knowing you know a bunch of the ones
near the top instead of just the very
tippy top can be very instructive
so one natural strategy is to iterate
the max procedure so go through the list
find the max pull it out of the list so
the list is now n minus 1 long and then
repeat this each time we compute the max
it'll be actually the second the third
the fourth largest from the original
list but it's always the max of the
current list it's a pretty reasonable
thing to do especially if K is small you
just need one or two or three of the top
values so another natural thing to do is
just sort the whole list once we sorted
the whole list the first K elements of
that sorted list are exactly the ones
that we want so this is actually a very
simple way of doing it in Python it
could just be essentially one or two
statements insertion is another strategy
this is the generalization of the
solution that I gave for the find the
second best example before in that
example I kept track of both of the best
and the second best and as new and then
was running through the list and each
new element of the list that was
encountered figure out where it would
fit into that top two list if it was
smaller than both of those ignore it if
it's bigger than both of those put it at
the top of the list and bump the list
down and so forth so as always we're
trying to find the best algorithm that
we can use to run on our data so which
of these algorithms has the best big
theta and I'm going to give you a hint
if there's we're looking for the top K
out of a list of n elements but K we're
going to look at this question for
different values of
okay in particular if K is half of the
list we want the the largest half of the
list question is are we better off using
selection or insertion both of these are
going to have the same big theta for all
these examples so I just grouped them
together or is it better to sort the
whole list keeping in mind that sorting
is a big theta of n log and operation so
you want to find the best route n items
is it better to use selection or sorting
if you want the top log in items which
one is better this function is the
logarithm of the logarithm of n so as as
slow growing as logarithm turns out to
be this is even slower or growing the
logarithm of the logarithm of n so which
one would you choose in that case and
finally let's say you want the top 100
this is a common thing that you see on
the internet a lot top 100 movies the
top 100 Beatles songs the top 100 times
I've used the phrase top 100 there's
lots of different contexts and which
disappears and if you're going to do
that are you better off using a
selection or insertion algorithm or to
sort the whole list so what I'd like you
to do is for each of these columns check
this box or that box or if they are big
theta of each other in other words from
an asymptotic standpoint this algorithm
and this algorithm will run the same
worst-case asymptotically then check
both of the boxes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
