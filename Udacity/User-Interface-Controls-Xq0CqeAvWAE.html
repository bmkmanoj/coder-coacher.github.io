course we will answer one big question
Android developers ask all the time and
that question is how do you use blank in
Android for instance how do you use
radio buttons or grids or maps and a
whole bunch of different components that
are available in Android now if you
think about it
developers encountered this question all
the time
and in response what they will do is
that they will conduct a search on the
Internet
read something like a blog or some Stack
Overflow page on how do you do something
in Android and then they will try that
in their app we will follow a similar
approach in this course to be successful
you will need the basics of Android
programming we taught those in the
Android for beginners course this is
where among other things we made the
happy put the app and the just Java app
you may also recall that in the Android
for beginners course we learnt about
buttons and checkboxes in this course we
will work with toggle buttons radio
buttons spinners and much more here is
how this course is going to work for
each of these interface elements that
you see on the screen here we found the
best resource on the internet that
teaches you how to use them in your app
so for toggle buttons we will link you
to a tutorial for radio buttons will do
the same thing and trust us these links
are good we know that because we've used
them ourselves here's what we want you
to do at the end of this video you will
see a tutorial on how to use toggle
buttons in Android follow the
instructions in that tutorial and learn
how to implement toggle buttons in an
app that you build from scratch once
you're done with that move on to the
tutorial for radio buttons and so on so
forth also each one of these links that
you're about to see will take you about
30 to 60 minutes to learn once you do a
few of these you would have mastered the
process experienced Android developers
follow every single day let's begin</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
