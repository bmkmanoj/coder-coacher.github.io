analogical reasoning we started by
talking about similarity as we saw in
our opening exercise similarity is
something that we evaluate very easily
without even really thinking about it
how can we design agents that can do the
same kind of similarity evaluation we
didn't talked about analogical retrieval
which can be difficult because we're
trying to retrieve examples across other
domains how can we structure our
knowledge to facilitate this kind of
retrieval how can a system know they'd
given a model of the atom in to retrieve
a model of the solar system then we
talked about mapping which is figuring
out which parts of different systems
correspond for example how can we figure
out the troops in the for example
correspond with lasers in the tumor
example we didn't talk about transfer
which is moving knowledge from the
concept that we know that the concept
that we don't for example we used what
we knew about the solar system to fill
in our knowledge of the atom then next
we talked about evaluation in storage
how do we evaluate our analogies in the
tumor example we might actually try that
medical procedure but for other
analogies how do we evaluate them and
then how do we store them for future use
last we talked about a special kind of
analogy designed by analogy or we use
something that we know a lot about to
inform our design is something new we'll
talk a lot more about this especially
designed by analogy when we come to the
design unit later in our course</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
