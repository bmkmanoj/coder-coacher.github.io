let's go back to methods for a moment
and think a little more carefully about
the syntax of how methods are called
I've initialized some movies here so we
can have a movie archive object devoted
to rob reiner movies you've already seen
a call to filter by year here it is one
more time we just use dot syntax on an
instance of the movie archive class and
then we call filter by year and passed
in the year we want to filter by let's
go with 1986 and then we'll want to grab
the first item from our movies array
print out the title and we can see that
it's stand by me filter by year is an
instance method you may also have
occasion to call type methods or class
methods type methods like type
properties belong to the class not to
any particular instance of the class and
so they're called on the class instead
of being called on an instance of the
class you're going to run into a number
of type methods when you start working
with the iOS user interface library
uikit for example here's a class method
that you'll use when you build the
second portfolio app me me this method
belongs to the uiimagepickercontroller
class it's called is source type
available it takes in a source type as
an argument it returns a bool indicating
whether that source type is available on
the current device a source type in this
case is the source of an image like a
camera or a photo album in the
playground there's no camera available
so in the playground environment if you
pass in source type camera this method
returns false the playground does have
access to the photo library so if you
pass in source type photo library the
method returns true if you are running
this code on a phone with a camera this
method would return true for both source
types let's take a look at the class
definition for uiimagepickercontroller I
can access it from the playground by
command clicking on the class name now
this might look intimidating but all it
is is a list of properties and methods
right here is the method is source type
available notice that it has the word
class before funk just like type
properties type method definitions begin
with the word class or static otherwise
they're defined just like instance
methods and if you use the word class
and so static sub classes will be able
to override them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
