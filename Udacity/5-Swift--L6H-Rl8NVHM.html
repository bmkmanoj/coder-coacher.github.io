and if you're new to the Swift
programming language I highly recommend
going through it for now I'm going to
attempt to give you a quick intro into
Swift in under five minutes it is just
the basics that you need to know and it
assumes you've seen some programming
language concepts before there are just
four key concepts to understand before
we can start coding variables control
flow classes and functions hopefully
you're watching this video as Xcode
downloads ready here we go variables if
you want to declare a variable and Swift
the VAR keyword lets you do that as an
example here we have a variable called X
of type int and we're setting its value
to 42 note the semicolons are not needed
do you see something else that's a bit
odd that's right the type of this
variable comes after the variable name
different than most other languages the
reason for this is that Swift can infer
the type of the variable so in most
cases you can leave the type completely
off for example here I could just make X
equal to 42 now something else you're
going to encounter in your code is a
constant for example here we have Y that
is a constant of type int with the value
of 100 Swift has infer the type int
because we're setting it to an int value
the next type of variable deems deal
with our strings they're easy to let me
show you an example here we have a
variable of type string and I'm setting
its value to hello moving on to control
flow the only item that you need to know
for control flow is if statements if
statements can determine what branch or
path your code to take as an example if
I put something like this we can take
one path if x is less than 50 and a
different path if X is greater than or
equal to 50 if we want to see what path
is chosen we can open the debug console
and take a look at that that's this
middle button here on the upper right
we're going to cover loops and the
powerful switch statements in the later
part of this course classes are objects
which allow you to store values and have
functions that operate on those values
the
really interesting part of classes is
that they have inheritance and therefore
they can carry forward any values and
functionalities from their parent called
a superclass if we look at this view
controller definition here we can see
that it inherits from UI view controller
and any instances or class functions
that I have would go here in the middle
where I've have these two green comment
lines you can declare class variables
that live in the class and functions
that exist in every instance of that
class just remember two things about
classes and Swift everything in between
the curly braces for the class is inside
the class and available to any function
in the class and the UI view controller
here is what this class inherits from
and it will be our hand where to look
for for built-in functionality that is
what functionality our view controller
class inherits from its parent
uiviewcontroller functions are a way to
encompass code and make it more reusable
functions start with the keyword funk
followed by a name than any parameters
and the return type here's an example of
the most basic function it takes no
parameters and it returns nothing it
just prints out hello we can call this
function by doing something like this we
can see hello here is printed out in the
debug console we can also have functions
that take a parameter for example if you
wanted to print hello in many languages
we could write a function like this
point hello message that takes in a
hello message string here we just simply
call it hello string it's of type string
and then we print that message to call
this function we'd simply do something
like this print hello message and pass
it the message that we wanted to send in
this case a hello greeting in Portuguese
so here we have the hello greeting in
English with the regular function taking
in no parameters returning nothing and
we have the Portuguese greeting for the
function that takes in one parameter
string it also doesn't return anything
it just simply runs the print command
that's just a little bit of swift that
you need to know before we dive into
Xcode and iOS development I've included
a link below on our swift refresher
and now the resources if you want to
learn more hopefully you'll finish
downloading and installing xcode when
you're ready let's go about creating
your first iOS app</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
