and if you're new to the Swift
programming language I highly recommend
going through it for now I'm going to
attempt to give you a quick intro into
swift in under five minutes it is just
the basics that you need to know and it
assumes you've seen some programming
language concepts before there are just
four key concepts to understand before
we can start coding variables control
flow classes and functions hopefully
you're watching this video as xcode
downloads ready here we go
variables if you want to declare a
variable and swift the VAR keyword lets
you do that as an example here we have a
variable called X of type int and we're
setting its value to 42 note the
semicolons are not needed do you see
something else that's a bit odd that's
right the type of this variable comes
after the variable name different than
most other languages the reason for this
is a swift can infer the type of the
variable so in most cases you can leave
the type completely off for example here
I could just make X equal to 42 now
something else you're gonna encounter in
your code is a constant for example here
we have Y that is a constant of type int
with the value of 100 swift has infer
the type int because we're setting it to
an int value the next type of variable
to deal with are strings they're easy to
let me show you an example here we have
a variable of type string and I'm
setting its value to hello
moving on to control flow the only item
that you need to know for control flow
is if statements if statements can
determine what branch or path your code
should take as an example if I put
something like this we can take one path
if X is less than 50 and a different
path if X is greater than or equal to 50
if we want to see what path is chosen we
can open the debug console and take a
look at that
that's this middle button here on the
upper right we're going to cover loops
and the powerful switch statements in
the later part of this course classes
are objects which allow you to store
values and have functions that operate
on those values the
really interesting part of classes is
that they have inheritance and therefore
they can carry forward any values and
functionalities from their parent called
a superclass if we look at this view
controller definition here we can see
that it inherits from uiviewcontroller
and any instances or class functions
that I have would go here in the middle
where I've have these two green comment
lines you can declare class variables
that live in the class and functions
that exist in every instance of that
class just remember two things about
classes in Swift everything in between
the curly braces for the class is inside
a class and available to any function in
the class and the uiviewcontroller here
is what this class inherits from and it
will be our hint where to look for for
built-in functionality that is what
functionality our view controller class
inherits from its parent UI view
controller functions are a way to
encompass code and make it more reusable
functions start with the keyword funk
followed by a name then any parameters
and the return type here's an example of
the most basic function it takes no
parameters and it returns nothing it
just prints out hello we can call this
function by doing something like this we
can see hello here is printed out in the
debug console we can also have functions
that take a parameter for example if you
wanted to print hello in many languages
we could write a function like this
print hello message that takes in a
Hello message string here we just simply
called it hello string it's of type
string and then we print that message to
call this function we'd simply do
something like this print hello message
and pass it the message that we wanted
to send in this case hello greeting in
Portuguese so here we have the hello
greeting in English with the regular
function taking in no parameters
returning nothing and we have the
Portuguese greeting for the function it
takes in one parameter string it also
doesn't return anything it just simply
runs the print command that's just a
little bit of Swift that you need to
know before we dive into Xcode and iOS
development I've included a link below
on our Swift refresher
and now the resources if you want to
learn more hopefully you'll finish
downloading and installing Xcode when
you're ready let's go about creating
your first iOS app</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
