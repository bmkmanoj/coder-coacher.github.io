repositories we can define dependencies
on artifacts contained in those
repositories dependencies that are
resolved from repositories are referred
to as external module dependencies
dependencies are assigned to
configurations we'll talk more about
configurations in detail later but for
now you can simply consider them to be
groups of related dependencies for the
examples here we'll be adding
dependencies to the compile
configuration which is added by the Java
plugin dependencies are configured in
the dependencies script block the syntax
used is the name of the configuration we
want to add the dependency to followed
by a dependency notation we can also use
a groovy map syntax to identify
dependencies again by their group their
name and their version in some cases we
simply have files we want to add as
dependencies file dependencies are
declared very similarly to manage
dependencies however instead of a
dependency notation we simply use a file
collection or file tree in this example
we are simply adding two jar files as
dependencies by creating a file
collection we can also use a file tree
which allows us to do things like
specify filters this is useful for
including a number of files within a
directory Gradle also supports project
dependencies which are dependencies on
other Gradle projects within a single
multi project build we'll talk more
about multi project builds and project
dependencies in the next lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
