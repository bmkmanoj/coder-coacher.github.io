back to the actual deduction process
when you are reasoning what could have
happened in the program we again see the
program execution as a succession of
states and then we reason backwards from
what we observe to what could have
happened beforehand this reasoning this
backwards reasoning is actually
structured along the ways that earlier
events in the program could have
influenced later remains the most
important concept when reasoning
backwards is called data dependency the
idea is as follows we do have two
statements say a and B in the program
and now a writes a variable which is
later read by be in our example up here
a may have written this variable and
this will then be read by B then we say
that these two statements are data
dependent on each other B is data
dependent on a because there's a flow of
data from the statement a to the
statement be this concept of data
dependency allows us to trace back the
possible locations in the state as well
as the statements that cause them back
within the program execution and
therefore to isolate the possible causes
for an infection and later the failure</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
