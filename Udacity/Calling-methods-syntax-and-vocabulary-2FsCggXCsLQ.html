let's see how to call them we'll start
by filling in the body of the Throwdown
method this method will simulate a
player throwing down a move rock paper
or scissors and simultaneously generate
an opponent's move in order to create a
rock-paper-scissors game in our case an
instance of the class RPS game the
player chooses a move rock paper or
scissors and that move gets passed into
the throw down method first off we'll
take that move and generate an instance
of RPS turn will call it player's turn
notice that the objective c compiler
doesn't infer types the way the swift
compiler does so every time we create a
new variable we need to first indicate
its type like we're doing here then on
the right side we allocate and
initialize an instance of RPS turn I'd
like to dissect the right side of this
statement focus in on this section and
you'll see our first method call in
between brackets on the Left we see the
object receiving the method call RPS
turn and on the right we see the method
alec but in objective-c instead of
saying we're calling a method we say
that we're sending a message so the
general form for a method call look
something like this in the previous
example RPS turn is the receiver and
alec is the message being sent to the
receiver next let's zoom out to the call
to an it with move on the Left we see
the receiver of the method call the
space and memory that's been allocated
on the right we see the method in it
with move followed by the argument
players move so here's the receiver the
message and the argument</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
