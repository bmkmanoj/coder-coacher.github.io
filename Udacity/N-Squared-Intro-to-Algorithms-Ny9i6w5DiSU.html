the last time that we're making a graph
with n nodes and again we're going to
zoom in to some power of two if it's
just a single node we just return that
node otherwise we recursively generate
the two sub graphs but now what we're
going to do is choose half of the nodes
from g one and half of the nodes that
are in g2 and connect all pairs so for
all I one in s1 and all I 2 and s 2
we're going to link i 1 and i 2 together
so we have some graph g 1 we have some
graph g 2 we choose half the nodes at
random to be called s1 we choose half
the nodes at random in this graph to be
s2 and then we connect up all pairs so
that every single node up here is
connected to every single node up here
it gets very densely connected here but
kind of much looser elsewhere so how
many nodes are in that graph we're going
to do another recurrence relation once
again a graph with one node has zero
edges a graph with n nodes as however
many edges are in two sub graphs each of
size n over 2 then we're going to add to
that what well we're going to take n
over 4 of the set of nodes and fully
connect them with another set of n over
4 nodes and over for from one side and
over for from the other we're looking at
all combinations of those so this
becomes our recurrence relation it's a
little bit cumbersome to work with this
that's funny constants in it so what
we're going to do is actually think
about it and big theta notation this is
just n squared right it's really 116 m
squared which is big data of N squared
alright let's take a look at what
happens in the same kind of tree
structure as before where the amount of
edges that we add at each of these
levels is some big theta of N squared so
at the top level going to be CN square
the next level down it's going to be C
and over 2 squared which is n squared
over 4 same thing twice which is C of n
squared over 2 next level down we square
we get 16 but they're going to be four
of these now so it becomes a quarter in
fact each level down here we're getting
C N squared over 1 over 2 over 4 over 8
/ 16 and so on and we had all these up
we get C and squared times 1 plus a half
plus a quarter plus an eighth and so on
which adds up to something on the order
of two so when all is said and done we
still have big theta of N squared edges
total so this recurrence relation saw
2n squared which is interesting right
because we do N squared really at just
the first level all the other levels
that we do the amount of work gets cut
in half each time and so even though
there's possibly a large number of
levels it doesn't add up to anything
more than another constant times n
squared</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
