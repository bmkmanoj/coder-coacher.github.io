some design decisions that differentiate
their approaches for example they often
differ on memory management java and c
lr provide garbage collection scom
provides reference counting and korba
doesn't provide anything at all as far
as container managed persistence is
concerned Java has enterprise javabeans
core behet CCM but CLR and com+ don't
provide anything the vendors also have
various approaches for dealing with
versioning some of them freeze some of
them have version numbers some of them
have compatibility rules and some of
them allow for side-by-side execution
some other differences include the
target environment for the component
frameworks j2ee and calm target servers
com also targets client and desktop
machines whereas corbett targets legacy
applications they also differ in terms
of their development environments j2ee
uses WebSphere which is the commercial
version of Eclipse and net uses visual
studio net as far as protocols are
concerned java and core bro support i io
p in XML Java supports also supports rmi
common CLR support be calm and clr
supports XML and soap</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
