should put this one here b/c F and G now
I've chosen the sizes and values so that
this is not that difficult for you to
figure out even though it is an
np-complete problem in the general case
I suppose you have seen that there's
lots of objects here which have a
comparable small size and a very large
value so probably putting in F and G is
rather obvious and also I would presume
putting in B and then once you're there
you can see what else you got and you've
already used up five of your size units
so you cannot put an e anymore and then
the best value of the remaining objects
a C and D is given to you by C which has
a value of five as opposed to four and
two and also you cannot put in more than
one so that makes see the only candidate
to also put into that container and for
that you get a total value of three plus
five plus five plus two so you get a
value of 15 in your container actually
not using up all the space in the
container because you only have size 2
for 2 and 1 which is a total size of 9
so with a container of size 10 you can
carry a value of 15 given these objects
over here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
