going to return to a data set that we've
talked about several times before the
OpenStreetMap data set and we're going
to make a case study out of it there are
several reasons why we chose to use this
data set for the case study the first is
that it's a really nice data set freely
available for download and it's an XML
which is the data format we've gained
some experience with during this course
now this is a human edited data set so
for our purposes this is great because
there are lots of opportunities for
cleaning and it's relatable you can
download the data for your own city
block your favorite summer travel
destination or a place you really want
to visit someday and finally it's open
source anyone can contribute to this
data set and you can potentially submit
back the improvements you made as you
work through this case study just an
option now the exercises will use a data
set that I chose of a city that I know
very well Chicago now we're going to
grade the submissions according to this
data set but please bear in mind that
there might be cultural differences in
how for example phone numbers or
addresses are formatted what makes sense
in Chicago might not make sense in say
Cobie so if you want to take your
improvements back to the community that
created the map you should take local
specifics into account okay good luck
and have fun</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
