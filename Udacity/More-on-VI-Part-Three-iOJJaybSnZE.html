probably should have put first now that
I write it down and that is the idea
that if we start off with some Q
function q1 and we run K steps of value
iteration in other words we apply the
bellman operator k times that the case
step bellman operator is a contraction
mapping and the index of contraction is
like gamma to the K which is a much much
smaller number so running K steps of
value duration actually pushes your
value functions much closer together
than say a single step of value duration
which is really what you'd expect that
is um although that's even better right
because it's not just it's not like
linear it's not like linear right it's
like gamma squared gammak you came into
the third camera through the cape right
and that's I mean that is the index of
contraction so we run ten steps of value
duration that's like running one step of
ten step value her agent so this again
it's not super surprising but what's
nice about it is it gives us a way of
quantifying how long we run value
iteration and connecting it with how
close you are to optimal after you've
run that far and so this kind of this
kind of fact is underlying these other
things that i wrote number one and
number two which is probably why i
should have said the third one first
that's okay we can fix it in post</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
