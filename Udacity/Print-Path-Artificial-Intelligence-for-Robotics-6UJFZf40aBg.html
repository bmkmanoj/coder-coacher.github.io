piece of software for you I would like
you to augment this to print something
entirely different which is the final
solution there's nothing to do with
expand and you have to implement a new
data structure for this similar to
expand here's the I would like to see
there's an error to the right which is
the optimal action to take in this cell
over here and again this is ambiguous
there might be a different optimal
action that's equally good but my
software picked the one to the right
here gonna go to down this little V over
here is an error down an arrow to the
right again and out to the right and out
to the right and out to the right down
down down and at the way and at the end
we find a star which indicates the
location of the goal let me modify the
maze I'm closing up the wall over here
opening the wall on here run it here is
my policy and you can see in the grid
this is the only way to make it to the
grid over here you should write for me a
piece of software that outputs this
specific thing over here part of this is
the data name that I kind of brushed
over before these four symbols over here
the ones being used to indicate arrows
to the top left down and right in there
correspond to the four actions over here
go up left down and right so use those
over here to printer at the table over
here it's very very non-trivial to write
this as you'll find out in the end is
not much code but you have to carefully
think about how to cache actions and how
to assign them to this table over here
so take a vial do it it's challenging if
you fail not a big deal you can
completely understand how the lecture
works and I'll show you the code once
you hit the submit button and you move
on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
