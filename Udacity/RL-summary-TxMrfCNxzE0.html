lecture I just want to repeat the points
so you see how reinforcement learning is
something that we can use in trading the
problem for reinforcement learning
algorithms is a Markov decision problem
and reinforcement learning algorithms
solve them a Markov decision problem is
defined by s a T and R where s is the
potential States a or the potential
actions T is a transition probability
which is given I'm in state s I take
action a what's probability I'll end up
in state s prime and R is the reward
function the goal for reinforcement
learning algorithm is to find a policy
PI that map's a state to an action that
we should take and its goal is to find
this pi such that it maximizes some
future sum of the reward and we talked
about that being either infinite horizon
fixed horizon or discounted sum we can
map our task for trading to
reinforcement learning and it works out
like this s our states are features
about stocks and whether or not we're
holding a stock actions are buy sell or
do nothing the transition function here
is the market and finally the reward
function is how much money we get at the
end of a trade so we can apply
reinforcement learning algorithms to
find this policy we've mentioned a few
those algorithms for instance policy
iteration and value iteration and Q
learning but we haven't talked in detail
about what they are and that's the
subject of lessons coming up okay that's
it for reinforcement learning I'll see
you again soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
