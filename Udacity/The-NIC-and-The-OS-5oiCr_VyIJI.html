operating systems I'm going to leave you
to explore most of the physical layer on
your own and focus on the part that has
implications for the operating system at
the edge of the network and end users
like you and me the most important piece
of hardware for us then is the network
interface card or Nick this typically is
a direct memory access or DMA device
meaning that once connected to the
memory bus it has the ability to read
and write from memory on its own
independent of the CPU typically the CPU
specifies through the bus the range of
memory it wants to be sent whether it's
a read of right and then sets the go bit
to let the Nick begin the Nick then
tries to copy the data as requested
because the Nick controller puts all of
the copy instructions on the bus the CPU
doesn't have to he can go about his
business to the extent that he finds the
information he needs in the CPU cache
there won't be any contention on the
memory bus only when the NIC finishes
either sending or receiving a packet
need he bothered the CPU with an
interrupt the Nick controller is also
responsible for putting
hardware-specific headers and footers on
the data for physical Ethernet this
would include an inner frame gap of
silence and a special preamble to
indicate the start of a frame</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
