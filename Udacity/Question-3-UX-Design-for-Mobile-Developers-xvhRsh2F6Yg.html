where the final project begins and so
work you do in this question may wind up
contributing to what you submit for your
final project submission at the end of
the class since your final project is
the design of an app the first step is
to answer the question what app are you
going to build and at this point I
should mention it's okay to not be
thinking of personas and use cases and
high-level flows here this is where you
decide on the project that is going to
excite you and keep you motivated
without that excitement probably won't
even build anything at all so it's
really important that we start with what
app do you want to build and here we're
really just talking about maybe a two to
three sentence explanation any more
detail than that
and you'd probably want to have an idea
of who your users are and what this app
is going to do at a high level keep in
mind that though you are going to be
coming back to this final project
throughout the class you can always
change your idea so don't feel like
whatever you do here you have to be too
committed to</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
