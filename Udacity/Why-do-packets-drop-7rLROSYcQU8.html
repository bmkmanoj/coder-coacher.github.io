deal with packet loss and other failures
but why do these ever happen in the
first place why don't know works just be
super reliable so nothing ever gets
dropped well that's not always an option
imagine that you have two machines a and
B attached to two different fast
networks but those fast networks are
connected by a slow network in the
middle like maybe these are two offices
with gigabit ethernet and the connection
between them is only 10 megabit that's a
hundred times slower then host a tries
to send a big pile of data over to host
B let's say a gigabyte of data because
its own network interface is very fast
in theory host a could transmit this
data as far as its nearby router in
about eight seconds but that data also
has to travel over this slow link and
because that's 100 times slower over
that 10 megabit network that's going to
take 13 minutes where does that data
have to live in the meantime if host a
were allowed to just push that big pile
of data onto the network in order for it
to get through this router would have to
buffer it in memory and trickle it out
over this slow link over the next 13
minutes and meanwhile nobody else on
this network would be able to send
anything this link would be saturated
completely full that wouldn't be a very
good outcome so TCP and routers don't
actually do it that way instead TCP
doesn't start sending data at full blast
it starts out slowly only increasing
speed when the other end shows it can
keep up by sending acknowledgments back
if packets are dropped it slows down and
then gradually it speeds up again and
routers work with this by dropping
packets if they're linked they're trying
to send on is too busy the result of
this is that the endpoints and the
routers in the middle collaborate to
move data at close to an optimal speed
but this only works because routers are
willing to drop packets in order to
signal congestion and endpoints are
willing to slow down in response if the
router just let everything queue up the
whole connection would eventually time
out this is called TCP congestion
control and it's one of the most
important
formance features of TCP</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
