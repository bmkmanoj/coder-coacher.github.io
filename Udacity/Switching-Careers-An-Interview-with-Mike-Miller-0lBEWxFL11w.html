know the optional resources up to and of
course including that the Career
Services one if you want to make a
career change starting with the resume
going through that course and when they
reference something like you should
think about having a portfolio you
should think about getting your LinkedIn
profile put placeholders there and go
work on those to having conversations
with technical recruiters like really
was great experience for me about just
being able to speak freely and like you
start assembling like the words like to
say that like really define what it is
you've been working on and the technical
recruiters ask this questions like so
what if your experience like I see this
on your resume can talk more about that
I think definitely take serious like
those there suggested resources becoming
like a developer for any platform for
any language for any whatever for any
technology it's not only just like
watching videos and learning like
specific skills but it's learning like
how do you find out and how do you come
to know things you know now you don't
know like how do you react in that
situation users as opportunities to like
prove that like this is what it means to
be a developer I don't know how to do
this and instead of being frustrated I'm
gonna go and figure out how to do this
instead of being discouraged like using
the opportunities for like growth and
problem-solving and just like realize
those are the things that like
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
