comma 5 it would have an a value of 8
and a B value of 4 good thinking if you
got these three right we'll start by
dividing each of these terms by 64 when
we divide this term by 64 well simplify
it to one sixteenth this term / 64 turns
into negative x squared divided by 64
and finally 64 / 64 equals one hour y
squared term comes first which means our
hyperbola needs to open up and it needs
to open down there's no number next to
the X variable so that means the center
or the x coordinate of the center is 0
the y coordinate of the center would be
positive 5 this is the K it's always
next to why the a is the number that we
move in the X direction so that's
underneath the x squared term it's the
square root of this number since the
square root of sixty-four equals 8 we
know the value of a it must be 84 the
value of B we simply take the square
root of sixteen which equals four we
start by graphing the ellipse with a
center at 0 5 and then we move eight
units in the X direction for two points
and four units in the Y direction for
two more points next we draw our dash
rectangle around our ellipse then we
draw in the two diagonals and since we
know the y squared term is first and is
positive we know our hyperbola opens up
and it opens down so we cut our lips
horizontally and we flip over these two
pieces ultimately this produces our
hyperbola as a quick check we can make
sure that these two points are four
units vertically away from the center
our center is at zero five so yes this
point is 4 units away vertically and
this point is 4 units away in the other
direction</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
