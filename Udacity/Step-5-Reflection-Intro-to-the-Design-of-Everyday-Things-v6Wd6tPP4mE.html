going to iterate our designs and then
we'll commit to them and we're going to
wrap them up in a presentation before we
do that let's go check in with the
students that Udacity office and hear
what they've learned from this project I
wanted to feel good when I use this up
so say someone came on or within your
range but what if you see a flower or a
fun picture that you like it adds a
click but it makes me feel good and I'm
happy to compensate for a click as far
as it makes me feel good so you click on
that and then it shows you the map and
shows you the person that you're most
likely to barter with or exchange or
transact with and gives a little profile
of who they are and what they're wanting
to offer once you dig deeper there's a
screen that tells you how many hours you
have so these were just supposed to be
coins that you have 16 hours right now
and for this transaction you need 3
hours there's a little button that can
help you transact once you have
transacted makes you feel better by
showing you an ice cream cone or a heart
sign or some image that makes you feel
nice like the fact that you're putting a
focus on that one person so if that's
like a mutual thing like if you got
showed Clifton's profile and then
Clifton gets showed Canelo's profile you
establish that mutual connection it's
much more kind of deep and meaningful
than just seeing like a list right and
you pick from that list because it
seemed to me as if the soul of the
business was about exchanging hours and
not money and that was it was already
fun I like the flower idea I would have
taken that from you if we don't already
have it on camera that you thought of it
you're addicted that's ok</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
