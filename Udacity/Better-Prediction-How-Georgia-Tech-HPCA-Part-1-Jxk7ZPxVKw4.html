to have a better predictor but the
question is how we have seen that the
predict taken predictor computes the
next PC as a function of the current PC
by just incrementing it so the question
is if all we know is the current PC is
there any better function that we can
use to form a better prediction of
what's coming next and the answer is if
all you know is the current PC then
probably you cannot make much of a
better prediction it will help us if we
knew is the instruction a branch but we
don't know that we are still fetching
the instruction while we are making the
prediction is this instruction going to
be taken as a branch again we have no
clue about that what is the offset field
of the instruction if this is a branch
this is what will be added to the PC to
form the target address if it's taken
but we don't know that either because we
haven't fetched instruction so really we
don't know for sure anything that might
be really useful in forming the good
prediction so it seems like it's
hopeless but it's not so what do we know
if we don't know anything for certain
what we do know is what the current PC
is but we also know something about how
that branch at this PC was behaving in
the past and we can use that because it
turns out that branches tend to behave
the same way over and over again so
really that is what we can use we don't
know for sure what this branch is gonna
do but we can know what it did the few
previous times when it was executed</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
