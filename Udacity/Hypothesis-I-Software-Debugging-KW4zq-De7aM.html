devise an experiment to further refine
this hypothesis let's come up with a
very simple input we would assume that
this holds if we put in just foo in
double quotes without any tags we would
assume that we would get the very same
output let's do this as an experiment
here again we have a buggy function and
now let's conduct the experiment so we
invoke print HTML markup with foo and
close in double quotes we press run and
the output is foo without double quotes
so now we see the output is not what we
expected the output be through without
quote and this again confirms our
hypothesis we can try this out with even
more strings further strengthening our
hypothesis so we could put in bar not
very surprising what's going to happen
we get bar as output and if we put in
just the two quotes what we get is an
empty string so we get more failures
down the way this hypothesis is
confirmed now by a number of experiments
double quotes are stripped from tagged
input but actually we didn't even have
any tags so we can actually scratch that
double quotes are stripped from general
input so even if there's no tags quotes
are being stripped away now we can
actually go and explore the cause-effect
chain if codes are being stripped away
there must be a place in the code which
does that the only place in our code
where quotes are handled right here in
this slide and we have if there is a
double quote or a single quote and tag
is being set then quote should be
inverted and when quote is inverted tags
should not be recognized nothing to
complicate but why would the quotes be
stripped because normally we should not
be in tag mode maybe we are in tag mode
maybe the variable tag is set so we
can't can come up with the new
hypothesis that explains precisely that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
