properly display a website Rises
constantly and has recently risen over
100 that means on average a website
requires over 100 requests to display
correctly things are getting a little
crazy
remember that HTTP 1 does not work well
with lots of requests
fortunately HTTP 2 has come to the
rescue
we'll look at some problems of HTTP 1
and how HTTP 2 is solving them one of
the reasons we have so many requests is
because of head-of-line blocking we
talked about this earlier but it's so
important let's briefly go over it again
head-of-line blocking is when one
request is blocking others from
completing a browser will open at most 6
connections to the same server that
means that most 6 requests can be in
flight simultaneously at the very least
you'll have to wait for the request to
be sent and then the response to be sent
back these two together are called the
round trip and the round trip time can
take between 20 to 50 milliseconds on a
good connection let's do some quick math
let's say a site needs to send 100
requests to lo completely we can handle
6 requests in parallel which means
ideally each connection will need to
make 17 requests to download all 100
requests with each request having a
round-trip time averaging roughly 35
milliseconds this yields 525
milliseconds about half a second of
waiting of doing nothing and this
assumes that actually transferring the
requested file doesn't take any time at
all
if the file being transferred is large
then this number will become a lot
bigger
this round-trip time is an average if
there's an unstable or slow internet
connection things only get worse
head-of-line blocking is a disaster to
good loading performance of a website
with HTTP 2 we don't have to worry about
head-of-line blocking</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
