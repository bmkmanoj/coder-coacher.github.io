making one of the problems go away
namely the power failure the
implementation is very simple 700 lines
of code and Vista as opposed to more
than 10,000 key lines of code in the
original lrvm implementation why because
there are no redo logs all the changes
that we're making to virtual memory for
persistent data structures directly get
into the data segment so no redo logs
correspondingly there is no truncation
code and checkpointing and recovery code
is significantly simplified and there is
no group commit optimizations the upshot
of all of these simplifications that
comes from one simple trick and that is
to make a portion of the DRAM persistent
and implement a file cache with that
persistent portion of DRAM you can get
rid of redo logs and get rid of
truncation code and Vista has the
simplicity of lrvm
but it is also performance efficient I
encourage you to browse through the
performance results that are reported in
the paper on Rio Vista which I have
assigned for your reading to see how
Vista performs compared to lrvm
in particular we saw performs three
orders of magnitude better than the
original lrvm because of the simplicity
and the fact that there is no disk i/o
that is the biggest improvement in
making Vista perform really well
compared to lrvm</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
