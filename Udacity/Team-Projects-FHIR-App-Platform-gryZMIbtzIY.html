widely adopted is that it could
constitute a universal health app
platform developers could then use that
platform to help solve some of the
limitations of current EHR systems will
discuss in less than six they can also
provide innovative tools for patients
the topic of lesson 7 in fact such a
platform already exists Harvard's Boston
Children's Hospital receive federal
funding to develop a universal health
app platform called smart the latest
version smart on fire is based on the
new standard and you can visit the app
gallery on their website using the link
provided in the instructors notes to see
examples of smart on fire apps these
could be plugged directly into any EHR
that supports the platform I'll
interview the chief architect of the
platform dr. Josh Mandel at the end of
lesson 5 be hims is the largest health
IT meeting in the world at the last two
hymns meetings he demonstrated multiple
EHRs running the same third-party apps
using this approach sooner and epic the
two largest enterprise healthcare
software companies have announced fire
support we believe it may not be long
before your most promising ideas could
plug into actual electronic record
systems you could then validate your
team's approach with real practicing
physicians are their clinical personnel
and their patients finally it is also
entirely possible that fire will be
further developed to solve the analytic
challenges will be discussing in lessons
