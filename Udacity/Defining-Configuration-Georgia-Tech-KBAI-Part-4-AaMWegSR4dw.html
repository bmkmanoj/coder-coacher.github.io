assigns values to variables to satisfy
certain constraints design in general
can be very complex and sometimes very
creative configuration is a kind of very
routine design the kind of everyday
mundane design which is very very common
while in design in the beginning you do
not know what the components or the
arrangement of components looks like in
configuration you already know all the
components you simply have to figure out
an arrangement that will satisfy some
constraints as an example consider the
furniture in the room in which you are
sitting right now all the components all
the pieces of furniture already known
the room is fixed you can't change the
room either but you certainly can move
the furniture around they might be some
constraints for example if the room has
a couch and a TV then you might impose
the constraint that the couch must be in
front of the TV and a certain number of
feet away from it given the constraint
that all the furniture must somehow fit
into the room as well as the constraint
that the TV must be in front of the
couch you might first decide to place
the TV and the cultic specific locations
and then having decided on the location
of the TV on the couch decide on the
location of the other pieces of
furniture they were given the
configuration is so common can you think
of other examples so it seems like we
could talk a lot about the physical
arrangement of things in different types
of rooms for example in an airline
configures a new airplane they have to
configure the arrangement of the seed
Syrian run to the window the arrangement
of the emergency exits and various
things like that but I think
configuration really goes beyond just
configuring the physical layout of items
so when I'm taking a picture with my
camera phone for example I have to
configure different options like the
focus whether or not the flash is on my
distance to what I'm taking a picture of
and if you have the different things
like that in doing so I'm still
balancing different restrictions so for
example if I'm taking a picture of a
landmark I can only be so close to it
and therefore I might need to make
different decisions based on the focus
of the flash in order to afford for how
far I can be from the line mark design
in general is a very common information
processing activity and configuration is
the most common kind of design now that
we have looked at the definition
reconfiguration task we're going to look
at methods for addressing their task
once again recall that the components in
case of configuration are already known
we are deciding on the arrangement of
those components by assigning values to
specific variables of those components
for example sizes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
