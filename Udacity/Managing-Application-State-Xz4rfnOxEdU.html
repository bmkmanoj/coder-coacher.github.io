a config method to configure how it gets
set up the config method takes a
function UI router includes a lot of
functionality two components will be
using our state provider and URL
provider will inject both of these into
the config function providers are like
services but only providers can be used
for a module configuration we can now
use state provider to set up the
different states of our app let's start
out with the default state and call it
home to add a state to our app we call
dot state give this data name again
we're going to use home and give it a
configuration object with the URL for
this state the template to use our app
is already using the default template so
we'll link to that and the controller to
load for that template we view state
provider to set up a state for the app
we need to use URL router provider to
load the home state by default so the
app state management is all set up but
there's one last thing we need to tell
you I router where to insert this
template we can do that with the
directive UI view we have access to this
directive because we've included the UI
router module into our project UI router
is now handling our apps state let's add
a new state for an individual menu item
let's create an item state we also need
to create the template and controller
for this item pay attention to this
right here the colon ID we can use
dynamic content in our routing let's
quickly generate a template and a
controller for an item I've also created
a few JSON files with more details about
the menu items when the URL is item /
some menu ID the ID will be accessible
in the idle controller by using the
state / am service will also add in the
food finder service so that we can
retrieve the item will use the get item
function and look up the item by its ID
then when it's returned the JSON file
we'll set it to the items data property
the get items function is very similar
to get menu except that it gets a single
item specified by the ID
let's make the name a link to that items
detail page ui-router gives us the UI
srf directive to switch between states
we want to switch to the item state and
pass along a value the state expects an
ID which will set to the items ID now
it's just filling out the template for
the item let's have it show the items
name the image of the menu item and its
rating and description and now our app
can be in the default state with the
menu showing or it can be in an item
state how awesome is that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
