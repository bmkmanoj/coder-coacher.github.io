knowledge-based AI is to contrast it
with the other schools of thought in AI
we can think in terms of a spectrum on
one end of the spectrum is acting the
other end of the spectrum is thinking as
an example when you're driving a car
you're acting on the world but when you
are planning what route to take you're
thinking about the world here is the
second dimension for distinguishing
between different schools of thought of
AI to one other end of the spectrum we
can think of air agents that are optimal
at the other end of the spectrum we can
think of air agents that act and think
like humans humans are multifunctional
they have very robust intelligence that
intelligence need not be optimal
relative to any one task but it's very
journal purpose it works for a very
large number of tasks whereas we can
think of air agents on the other side
which are optimal for a given task given
these two axis we get four quadrants
starting from the top left and going
counterclockwise here our agents in
think optimally agents that act
optimally agents that act like humans an
agent said think records and this
particular calls a knowledge-based AI
we're interested in agents that think
like humans let us take a few examples
to make sure that we understand these
four quadrants well here are some
well-known computational techniques
consider many machine learning
algorithms these algorithms analyze
large amounts of data and determine
patterns of the gravity in that data
well I might think of them as being in
the top-left quadrant this early doing
thinking and the option are optimal but
they're not necessarily human-like a
plane autopilots they would grow under
acting optimally they're certainly
acting in the world and you want them to
act optimally improvisational robots
that can perhaps dance to the music that
you play they are acting and they're
behaving like humans
dancing to some music Semantic Web a new
generation of web technologies in which
the web understand
the various pages and information on it
I might put that under thinking like
humans they are thinking not acting in
the world and it's much more like humans
than let's say some of the other
computational techniques there if you're
interested in reading some more about
these projects you can check out the
course materials where we've provided
some recent papers on these different
computational techniques there's a lot
of cutting-edge research going on here
at Georgia Tech and elsewhere all these
different technologies and if you really
are interested in this this is something
where we are always looking for
