we have our app that if the submission
is not valid we just rewrite the form
out and if it is valid we say thanks now
let's work on this invalid case let's
make that a little bit more friendly the
first thing we want to do is tell the
user there was an error so let's let's
figure out a way to do that we're gonna
add a little section to our form here
for a little placeholder for our error
message after our form we're going to
have a div you remember divs it's just a
block element with no with no special
styling or anything like that it'll just
make a new line for us and inside that
we're gonna print our error message and
we're going to use the string
substitution we just learned to print
our error message now I'm gonna do one
more thing here is I'm going to make
this text appear red this is I'm gonna
add a little CSS style color red now
this is like I said we're not gonna
spend a whole lot of time in CSS but
this is one example of how we'd use it
this will make this text in this div
appear red okay so we need to update our
form a little bit or the way we use form
to use this since we're going to be
printing the form in a couple places you
know here and here let's generalize this
into a function so I'm going to add a
new function called
write form and this is going to take a
parameter for the error message and the
default value of this parameter is going
to be the empty string and all this is
going to do is it's going to self dot
response that out it's going to write
our form like we've been doing before
but we have to use a string substitution
now because we've included a variable in
our form we have to address it here and
we're going to say error equals error so
this is going to say the string error in
our form will be equal to the value of
this variable here error so this
variable in the function is used down
here and it refers to the string
substitution error here okay now we need
to use this function we have this new
function right form so let's use it in
the everywhere where we draw our form
now so we can use it here in our get and
use it here on our get function so now
we can say so
right form an error takes a default
parameter so we don't need to specify
here and we can also use it down here in
our post function let me say self dot
right form and now we can give it an
error message okay
so what have we done we've updated our
form we've made a new write form
function that should be a you know a
nice way of calling this and we've used
our write form function here our get
remembered just draws the empty form and
our post down here should draw the form
with with a new error message so let's
give this a try out in practice and
there's one last thing we forgot to do
the first parameter to all of our
functions inside a class should be self
because otherwise this self here
wouldn't be referring to anything okay
so we've got that in place let's try
this out in our browser here we are in
our browser let's give our form a shot
I'm going to type in some invalid data
first because that's oh that's what we
were just testing so invalid everythings
and we submit this form aha now we have
our error message and it appeared red
like we wanted it to really cool so now
the user has an opportunity to submit
the form again in a valid way okay so
we're gonna fill out this form with
correct data and when we submit it now
we still see our success message cool
alright so we're making progress the one
thing that would be nice is if when we
entered bad data when we entered an
invalid form and we submit this it would
be nice if it left our values in here
for us so we don't have to enter
everything over and over again
especially the ones that are already
valid let's let's make that work</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
