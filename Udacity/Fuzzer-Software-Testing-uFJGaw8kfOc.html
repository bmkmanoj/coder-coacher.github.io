said I'm going to go write a random
tester or buzzer in our example we're
going to be fuzzing PDF files and our
application is a couple of PDF readers
this example is taken from Charlie
Miller's fuzzer babysitting and army of
monkeys I encourage you all to look at
these links to start this buzzer we
begin by choosing a random file and
choosing a random PDF application we
then read in off the bytes from our file
and store them in a buffer next we run a
random function to determine the number
of rice that will be doing based on the
fuzz factor we defined this fuzz factor
to be 250 now you can see as the false
factor increases the number of rice
decreases based on a number of rights we
create a bite a random byte and choose
from our buffer one of the bytes that
we're going to overwrite we then
overwrite that bite with a random one
and we continue to do that until we get
to the number of rice
finally we invite all of our new bytes
to a file a new file so we don't
override our old one and we then use the
sub process module to open our
application with our new file now when
you run this script might see your
program go crazy and if that happens and
you've done it correctly now there are a
few things I want to point out this
chunk of code is the heart of the fuzzer
this is all that you really need for
this program forward a couple of other
things notice that we don't do any
logging this is bad practice for all
programmers you should always do logging
and your applications to make the
bugging easier so what I want you to do
is write a fuzzer
based on the one that we gave you for
real-world applications in our example
we first tested PDF files after you've
written your father I want you to go to
the forums and link to your fuzzer so
what you fuzzed describe any bugs that
you film and explain how you would
improve your fuzzer
and the future post all these things to
the forum and when you're finished
check this box now of course you can
check this box without actually having
done the problem set but then will be
the point good luck on thumbs up for</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
