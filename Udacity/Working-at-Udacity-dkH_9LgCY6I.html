comes from all around the United States
all over the world and although our
backgrounds are diverse we share a
passion for making great education
available to everyone in the world for
free my background is in theoretical
biophysics Spanish and geography the
chemistry at Stanford English literature
philosophy I got my degree in physics
from MIT one point is toward for the
government I've worked in small startups
I've worked in large companies and right
before this SEVIS working in a
psychology lab everybody who's at this
company who you know coming from really
really diverse backgrounds is able to
get together and have a good time and
relate to each other and I think that
makes for a really great working
community by and large even the people
that are remote from us like you know
Attila Michael Cera get Vega we still
have a fairly strong presence with them
in the office you don't get that
attitude where if you ask something for
help they refuse because that's not
their job
everything is everyone's job there's
something to be said for really loving
what you're doing a really feeling
passionate about what you're doing and
working with other people that feel that
passion why we're all here is because we
want to change education
seeing student responses in the forums
and getting these random thank you
emails from from people that I had no
idea knew I existed this morning I got
an email from a student in Hyderabad
India saying good job keep up the good
work
the opportunity you have at Udacity to
impact millions of people by providing
some credibility empowered them Udacity
has seen the excitement of students
around the world join us in solving one
of the most important problems in the
world today they can great education
available to have</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
