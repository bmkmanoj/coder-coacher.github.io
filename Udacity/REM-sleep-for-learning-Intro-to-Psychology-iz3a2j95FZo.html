of REM sleep is to assist the brain in
growth and development do you remember
when we previously talked about neural
plasticity in other lessons well in
infancy our brains are very plastic and
less plastic and old age we see this
correspond with the amount of REM sleep
we give at these different ages a
fascinating component of REM sleep is
that this is when we dream and while
we're dreaming the areas of our brain
that are responsible for receiving
sensory stimulation and responsible for
controlling and planning our body
movements are actually activated this is
why we feel like we're running or
swimming or even falling while we're
dreaming in essence we feel the dream
like it's really happening
sleep is an adaptive response and
imperative for healthy functioning both
mentally and physically if we don't get
enough REM sleep one night we're gonna
get more REM sleep the next night this
is called the rebound effect this shows
us that there's both a biological need
for sleeping and REM sleep now let's
finish up this material on sleeping and
dreaming with Susan and talk about an
area that I find really fascinating
that's the ability for someone to become
consciously aware where they're dreaming
lucid dreaming</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
