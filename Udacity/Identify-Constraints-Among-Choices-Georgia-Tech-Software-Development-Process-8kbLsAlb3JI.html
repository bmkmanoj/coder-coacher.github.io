looking at the split program before is
that if we just combine the interesting
values that we identify we may end up
with a lot of cases and I mentioned that
we were going to look at some way of
addressing that problem and this is
exactly what happens in the next step of
the category partition method in which
we identify constraints among choices
and why do we identify these constraints
we do that to eliminate meaningless
combinations of inputs if you remember
for example we have the case in which we
were trying to create a string with a
size less than zero which doesn't make
any sense and very importantly we also
do that to reduce the number of test
cases because every time we constrain
one of the possible choices we eliminate
possible test cases so we can use it to
keep under control
the number of tests that we generate
there are three types of properties the
pair property if error properties and
properties of type single so we're going
to look at what these properties mean
using once more our example of the Split
program in particular we're going to use
some of the choices that we identified
earlier so let's look for example of
choice 0 for category length of the
string all we can say is that if the
length is 0 this define a special
property of the string and we specified
in this way by saying that this
identifies properties 0 value so every
time that we use this choice 0 value is
defined at this point we can use this to
exclude some meaningless combinations
for instance consider special characters
if we have a string of length 0 which
means a string with no characters
obviously there cannot be special
characters so considering this
combination will just be a waste of time
so what we do is that we specify next to
this choice that we're only considered
this if length is not 0 and we do this
by saying that we consider this only if
not 0 value so if 0 value is not defined
so this pair is an example of a property
if case define the property and use that
property now let's look at the case in
which we might want to use an arrow
property for instance when we look at
the category value for the input size
the choice value less than 0 is an
erroneous choice so it's a choice that
we selected to test the possibly around
your situation so we can mark this as an
error property and what that means is
then when generating possible
combination of choices we will consider
this only once because we assume that we
just want to test this error condition
once fine
the single property is a property that
we use when we want to limit the number
of test cases and it's similar as an
effect to error it just has a different
meaning so what we do when we use the
single property is that we're saying
this choice we want to use in only one
combination so don't combine it multiple
times and that of course given the
combinatorial nature of the problem cuts
down dramatically the number of test
cases and we might use for instance a
single property for maxint which means
that we will only have one test case in
which the size is equal to max' and
we're actually going to see a demo on
this topic so we'll have more chances of
seeing how properties work in practice
and how good they are at eliminating
meaningless combinations and at reducing
the number of test cases</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
