terms of prediction accuracy
unfortunately there's quite a lot of
variants in this data so we've already
been looking at inter tweet time meaning
if there's a tweet t1 and t2 insert we
time is the number of seconds between
them but what we're trying to predict is
more granular than this right
specifically if it's been delta T
seconds since the tweet occurred we want
to try to predict the amount of time
labeled P here until the person tweets
again so in order to do this we have to
collect a bunch of training examples so
our training examples are going to look
like this we want lots of pairs of
elapsed time since the last tweet and
how far we have to go until the next
week to get an understanding of the
variance in our data let's create this
training data from the given raw data
and then make some graphs you can see
here we're just producing these very
same points from the given raw data in
time until next which is just the time
between tweets we produce a series of
more granular points how much time has
elapsed and how much time to go until
the next tweet and we collect them
together in the list data points so to
get an idea of variance let's take a
look at a few fixed points specifically
let's look at what the data looks like
when 10 seconds has lapsed 150 seconds
is elapsed and 100 seconds has elapsed
to get an initial idea about what the
variance looks like in our data let's
fix it at a couple of points
specifically let's look at what the data
looks like after 10 seconds is elapsed
and 150 seconds is elapsed let's zero in
on the 10 second graph first so let's
look at what this graph is saying this
is just a histogram saying that if 10
seconds has elapsed since my last tweet
how long did I have to wait until the
next tweet occurred so here 0
collapse until the next tweet occurred
and at the other end of the graph 90,000
seconds has elapsed until the next tweet
occurs as you can see it's huge strongly
towards zero seconds again it looks like
an exponential distribution now let's
look at what this looks like for 150
seconds again this is a graph of after
150 seconds has elapsed since the last
tweet how long did we have to wait until
the next tweet at the left end we had to
wait 0 seconds at the right end 90,000
seconds as you can see again looks just
like an exponential distribution in fact
let's look at a graph of the standard
deviation again the x-axis here is the
number of seconds that has elapsed since
the last tweet so 0 seconds 10 seconds
20 and so on the y-axis describes the
number of seconds until the next tweet
occurs and this graph describes the
standard deviation in that quantity so
as you can see the spread of the times
that we have to wait until the next
tweet occurs increases at the time
elapses since the last tweet let's
visualize this another way this graph
shows a ninety-five percent confidence
interval of the time we have to wait
until the next tweet as a function of
elapsed time so after 20 seconds elapsed
here's the spread of how long we have to
wait as you can see it spreads all the
way from 0 seconds to 30,000 seconds
after 60 seconds has elapsed the spread
goes all the way from 0 seconds to
35,000 seconds so as you can see this is
just another way to describe the graph
we just saw of the increasing standard
deviation the confidence band just
increases as time goes on this is just
another way of saying that as time goes
on were more and more uncertain of how
long it's going to be until they tweet
next any estimator that we create which
is a function of delta T will do so by
essentially averaging over the spread at
any given point along the graph again as
you can see the spread gets wider as the
elapsed time goes on
reflecting greater and greater
uncertainty in the data as the time
since the last tweet grows elapsed time
becomes less and less good at
determining what the inter tweet time is
and any predictor we make based on delta
T will suffer from this this problem is
called inherent variance note this is
not the same thing as model variants
which refers to how the output of your
model is sensitive to training data
inherent variance refers to the
following concept let's suppose that our
real model meaning the actual real-life
phenomenon will in fact a linear one
meaning you had some function f and it
was a function of the single variable X
as data scientists we collect records of
the form X cometh from these records we
will try to build an estimator and will
probably have a pretty easy time of it
right for a given fixed value x1 we will
always see the very same value of F
beside that a times X 1 over and over as
we collect records every time we see x1
we will always see a times X one beside
it now let's suppose we introduce some
noise into the situation the way to
think about this is X occurs but before
we can measure it as f some noise
process occurs to X and the result is
the thing that we measure the
consequences now we no longer see the
same f for a given X the first time we
see x1 we might see value one beside it
the next time value 2 and so on this
spread of values v1 v2 and so on
produces the confidence band effect that
we saw earlier that of course makes
finding the right value to guess for a
given x1 much more difficult in the next
video we'll talk about sources of this
variance and what we can do about it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
