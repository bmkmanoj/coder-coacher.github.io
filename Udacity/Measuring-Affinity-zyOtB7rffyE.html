pictures as of not just a collection of
pixels but actually as a graph and what
I mean by a graph is shown here so in
the graph we have a node for every pixel
okay and between every pair of pixels is
a link okay
Dustin's in any other graph those are
the edges of our graph right and on each
edge there's what's referred to as an
affinity weight or just a weight and
here that's written as wpq right and the
idea is that I'm gonna need an edge for
any weight that is nonzero okay and the
weight is gonna measure the similarity
between two pixels and the two and the
similarity will be essentially inversely
proportional to the difference so that
just means that the the more different
they are the less similar they are and
another way of saying is if the
difference is too big I'm gonna say the
similarity is zero so those edges go
away so I'm gonna build a weight matrix
using this affinity so I a standard
affinity for example might be that I'm
just gonna use a Gaussian right where I
say the the affinity between two pixels
a and J is just this exponentiation it
as a function it's just this
exponentiation as a function of the
distance so of course there is a
parameter here and here you can see the
change in affinity depending upon what
that parameter is you get these
different curves and essentially if you
use a very small Sigma this thing goes
grows quickly so in which case only
nearby pixels get any reasonable
affinity at all whereas if you have a
large Sigma you can connect you can have
strong affinities in between points that
are somewhat far away far away in your
distance space so if your distance
includes just color then it would be
that but typically our distances also
can include actual distance</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
