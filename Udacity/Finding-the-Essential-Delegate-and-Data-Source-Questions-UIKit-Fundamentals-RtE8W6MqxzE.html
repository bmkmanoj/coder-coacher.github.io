protocols with a total of 44 methods the
two protocols are the UI tableview
delegate which governs responses to user
events and the UI tableview datasource
which enables the table to access data
and cells so think of the delegate as
being associated with events and the
data sources being associated with data
appropriately enough the table uses its
delegate protocol to ask event questions
like these what should happen when a
button in a cell is tapped what should
be the response to cell selection how
should I respond when a user begins
editing a row what should happen when a
cell is deselected the table uses its
datasource protocol to ask data
questions like these how many rows do I
have how many sections do I have what
are the titles for the sections what is
the cell view for each row here I've
opened the class reference for the UI
tableview delegate
where you can find a complete list of
the protocols methods many are related
to managing sections like the ones we
saw in the contacts and settings apps
don't worry about those as much for now
since we'll be focusing on single
section tables visit the documentation
on your own
skim through the list and for each
method think about the question that the
view is asking its delegate when you're
done answer the quiz question think of
yourself as a table if you could only
ask three of these questions and you
needed to build a single section table
which would you pick</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
