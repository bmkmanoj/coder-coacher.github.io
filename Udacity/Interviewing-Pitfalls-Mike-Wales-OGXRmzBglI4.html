interview experience so during an
interview one time I was given 15
minutes to write the computer side of
tic-tac-toe function that would play the
computer side now I play tic-tac-toe a
lot with my kids and we all know if you
get three corners you win the game so
that's what I approached it as and I'm
standing at the whiteboard and I keep
mumbling to myself just get three
corners and I win I'm telling the the
interviewer if I get three corners I win
and I wasted 15 minutes trying to win
the game of tic-tac-toe and at the end I
didn't even have a function that would
play the game of tic-tac-toe it was
horrible it wouldn't even run it would
have been better for me to just write a
function that would put an X in the very
first available slot instead I'm too
worried about winning and winning and
winning I walked away from that I had a
friend who interviewed at the same
company and I was like dude I had this
question and I didn't do very well and
he laughed about it and he reassured me
he said I bombed it as well the first
time and then we sat down and worked
through another solution that not only
played the game but also played it very
well and so that was fun and I got to
learn a little bit from the process as
well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
