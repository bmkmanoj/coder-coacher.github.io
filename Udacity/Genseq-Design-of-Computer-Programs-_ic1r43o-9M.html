generate sequence so let's talk about
that now sequence in this formulation is
a function that takes X and y2 patterns
and what it returns is a function and
that function takes a list of numbers
and returns a set of texts that match so
sequence is delaying the calculation
it's computing a function which can do
the calculation later on gen sequence
does the calculation immediately it
takes x and y and a set of numbers and
it immediately calculates the set of
possible texts now the question is what
do we know about Gem sequence in terms
of the patterns x and y and the set of
possible numbers we know at some point
we're going to have to call the pattern
x with some set of numbers
we're not quite sure yet what and that's
going to return a list of possible texts
and then we're gonna have to call y with
some other set of numbers and then we're
gonna have to concatenate them together
and see if they make sense if the
concatenation of some x and some y if
that length is within this allowable set
now what do we know about what these
ends should be in terms of this set of
possible numbers here well regardless of
what this set is this could be a dense
set so we could have NS equals 0 1 2 all
the way up to 10 or something or it
could be a sparse set it could be say
only the number 10 but either way the
restriction on x and y is such that they
have to add up to no more than 10 but X
could be anything
if the list of possible numbers that we
want to add up to is only 10 that
doesn't constrain X at all other than to
be less than 10 so this end should be
everything up to the maximum of n sub s
and then what should Y be well we have
two choices one we could for each X that
comes back we could generate the Y's or
we could generate the Y's all at once
and then try to combine them together
and see if they match up and I think
that's actually easier and so for the
Y's also
they can be any size up to the maximum
and then we take the two together add up
the X match and the Y match and see if
that length is within n so in this
example if ten asked is equal to ten
here we want to have the ends be
everything from zero up to ten inclusive
in both cases and we get back some
results like say a a b b a c d e and so
on and some other results over here a b
b c d and then for each of them we add
them up and if we say a B b-plus a B and
check to see if that's in NS if it is we
keep it if it's not we don't keep it so
here's a candidate dilution for Gen
sequence so we take X Y and a set of
numbers and then we define n SS as being
everything up to the largest number
including the largest number so we have
to add one to the maximum number in
order to get a range going from zero up
to an including the largest number so
now that we know the possible values of
the numbers that we're looking for for
the sizes of the two components the X
and the y component then we can say m1
is all the possible matches for X m2 is
all the possible matches for y and if
the length of m1 plus m2 is in the
original set of numbers that we're
looking for then return m1 plus m2 so
this seems reasonable it looks like it's
doing about what we're looking for to
generate all sequences of x and y
concatenated together but I want you to
think about it and say have we really
gotten this right and the choices are is
this function correct for all inputs or
is it incorrect for some does it return
incorrect results or is it correct when
it returns but doesn't know is return
think about that think about is there
any result that looks like it's
incorrect that that's being formed and
think about as an infinite loop or not
and so think about base cases on
recursion and saying is there any case
where it looks like it might not return
this is a tricky question so I want you
to try it but it may be difficult to get
this
