system so what does it really do for you
first of all as I said before the
hardware is actually not very easy to
use if you had to use it directly if you
wanted to program your applications and
had to work with the hardware directly
it's going to be infinitely more complex
it may already be hard but it's going to
be much harder so that what the
operating system does is that it creates
easier to use and high level
abstractions for the resources that we
have that the hardware provides for
example we know that data that must be
persistent it's stored on the disk in
this Blatz well we actually don't
directly work with this blocks and keep
track of where on disk a certain piece
of information may be we have things
called files think of file as a high
level are we going to talk about virtual
resources that are created or supported
by the operating system and made
available to you so these high-level
abstractions that we can use to access
more user-friendly resources in some way
make it easier for us to write our
applications or build our applications
that going to run on this computer
system now the resources that we going
to provide the high-level resources the
operating system makes available to the
applications well they're going to be
implemented using their real physical
resources that we have that the hardware
provides to us the resources the
physical resources are going to be
shared across these different
applications obviously when you have
that kind of sharing we need to access
those resources in a controlled fashion
so the hardware resources are actually
managed by the operating system and
access to those is going to be
controlled we are it as well and that
actually is one of the fundamental
reasons why operating systems have such
an important role to play when it comes
to protecting resources and securing
access to them the last thing that is
really interesting and we're going to
spend good bit of time on that is all
the different applications or different
processes going to run on the same
system and share the resources we have
the physical resources that we have
between them but the operating system
sort of makes each process believe as if
it's the only one running and it's able
to do that by providing what we call
isolation between these different
processes in some sense one process or
one application does not need to be
aware of another application unless it
explicitly decides to interact with it
it's sharing these physical resources
but think about the operating system
making sure that what is being used by
one application doesn't get used by
somebody else or another process or
another application so having this
isolation sort of giving each
application sort of the feeling that it
is the only one running we should say
that if they share of course not each
process has all the resources so there
may be some performance of implications
but if you don't worry about performance
basically each process can believe as if
it has the resources and the computer to
itself so the operating system is
actually going to create this isolation
between these different applications
which is really important because
applications may not trust each other
and if they don't trust each other they
don't want any sort of interference from
other processes that are not trusted by
them so this isolation is the operating
system provided isolation is actually
going to guarantee to us that the
processor doesn't have to worry about
other processes or other applications
that may be there in the system</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
