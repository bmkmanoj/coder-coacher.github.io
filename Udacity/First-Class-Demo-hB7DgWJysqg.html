scratch and go through the code however
you can also download a rich playground
with more information for your reference
you may find the link in the instructor
notes so what does it mean for a closure
to be a first-class citizen of the
language it means you can use closures
just like any other types such as and
floats strings whatever you can assign
them to variables or constants put them
inside arrays or dictionaries return
them as the result of a function or
closure and even receive them as
parameters of another function or
closure that last part seems a little
bit weird so let's solve the most
obvious part first of all we're going to
assign a closure to the bar or a
constant okay so here we are creating a
closure using syntax closure and we're
assigning that closure to a constant so
that's a little bit different and this
closure just fix when integer returns
another integer and within the body of
it there should be X by the way it adds
42 to X okay so it's a pretty simple
closure and closures have types you look
right here in this result sidebar and
you'll see that the type of this closure
is int arrow in it means it takes one
integer and returns an integer and we
can call this closure just like we would
call any function or any other closure
so let's give it a try so the bottom
line is we can use the closure that we
saved into the constant F in the normal
way using the regular syntax however try
to call it passing the string as a
parameter this will cause an error and
by now you should already know what's
going on it's not the type that the
closure accepts so it works exactly as
functions so far let's get rid of this
and now let's try something fancier
let's put a bunch of closures inside an
array let's see if it's possible so here
we have an array called closures with
one closure inside and the type is as
you would expect an array of int to int
so this defines what kind of closure we
can put inside this array as long as the
closure takes one in and returns an in
we should be able to put it in there
let's add a few more okay so here we
have the final array with several
closures in there all these closures
have one thing in common they have the
same type they take an int and returning
it how does the compiler know that
because of the first one so this sets
the type of closure that can go in there
the second one over here has the full
closure syntax with type information for
the parameter and the return type that's
not really necessary because the
compiler has little information already
so the next one avoids the type
information and it works fine the other
one the next one doesn't have the return
why because when a closure just has one
statement one line the return is
implicit so the compiler knows that it
should return x times X and last but not
least we have this ultra simple version
where we don't even provide a name for
the parameter because in Swift closures
and functions can access their
parameters or arguments by the position
so dollar zero means position zero the
first one first parameter x 42 and
return that could we call those closures
that are stored in the in the array yes
definitely yes so let's give it a try so
right here we're iterating through the
array of closures and for each closure
we call it passing 42 and here you can
see the
results you can also see it this way
okay now I've got an exercise for you
try to create an array with two closures
one that takes two integers and returns
the Sun as another integer and the other
closure should take two floats and
return the sum as a float would this
compile think why</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
