time as I normally do because you think
you already know the answer so what's
the answer so you know I'd rather get
the plus twos occasionally so I'll say
at the bottom one no wait what you're
not gonna tell me the top one's better
uh no it's not okay then that feels like
a trick question it's not a trick
question the answer is neither one is
better than the other oh so I had to
give neither or both which is better and
I can click on knife or you could click
on both okay so you thought that the
bottom one was better what was your
reasoning for that because sort of
moment-to-moment
sometimes I'm getting Plus Ones and that
matches what I would have gotten if I
had been on the other bank but then
sometimes I get plus twos which is
actually better than what I would have
gotten on the other bank
and so I I never feel any regret being
on the bottom bank I only feel regret
being on the top bank that's fine so
what would you say the utility of the
sequence along the bottom actually is 1
plus 1 plus 2 plus 1 plus 1 plus 2 plus
dot dot which is equal to I guess that's
right what about the utility of the top
1 1 plus 1 plus 1 put that's also
infinity yep so the utility of both of
those sequences is equal to infinity do
you think one of them is bigger than the
other you treat the bottom one a lot a
little bit larger I did or longer anyway
yeah but in the end the sum of the
rewards that you get are both going to
be infinity so the truth is neither one
of them is better than the other I still
don't think you can say that both are
better you can't get around that but
yeah I see I see neither I could see
tonigh there is better or they both are
better neither is better both is better
whatever the point is is that they're
both equal to infinity and the reason
they're equal to infinity is because all
we're doing is accumulating rewards and
if we're always going to be able to get
positive rewards no matter what we do
then it doesn't matter what we do this
is the existential dilemma of being
immortal Oh living forever so if you
live forever then like why should you
care about anything ever right I mean
everyone every all the mortal people are
gonna die and one day they'll all be you
know an infinite amount of time in your
past I could do this thing here which is
pleasurable
or I could do this thing right now that
you know will is less pleasurable but
will eventually get me to a better place
but if I'm gonna live forever and I can
always get to a better place then it
really doesn't matter what I do it
really doesn't matter mmm because I'm
just accumulating rewards I'm living
forever and I'm gonna infinity as
infinity and there's really no way to
compare them having said that your
original notion that look it feels like
I should never regret having taken the
second path compared to the first
because I will occasionally do better
seems like the right intuition to have I
see but it's just not built into this
particular utility scheme right but it
turns out there's a very easy way we can
build it into this utility scheme by
just making one tiny little change would
you like to see it yes beautiful let's
see it then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
