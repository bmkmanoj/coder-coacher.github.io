started on the right here our start
symbol is s and it goes to P Q R and
there actually aren't that many choices
if we think about it there are two
strings in this grammar p q r &amp;amp; P Q
nothing so this doesn't look like a good
bet because it doesn't produce p QQ or
PE aur pyaar this is not a match all
right what do we have over here well
every string is going to have to start
with lowercase P and then Q looks like i
can have zero or more cues and then
eventually we end with an R so this
looks pretty good because it matches the
first string and this string down here
but it doesn't get pqq so I don't like
this one how about this grammar in the
middle that uses ABC instead of sonatas
populous quail domani in the name of the
senate in the people of Rome a B and C
well we have two choices for our start
symbol that definitely complicates
things but both of them start with a pee
well that's convenient since all five of
our strings start with a pee let's just
go through the strings one at a time can
I get P alone yes a goes to pee bee bee
goes to nothing so I can get that one
how about p QQ a goes to PB B goes to Q
and then Q again and then nothing yeah I
can get that one how about PR a goes to
pbc B goes to nothing C goes to our oh
this is looking super promising p QR
will use the first rule pbc will gather
up one Q and then we'll have an are
great p QQ r will use the first rule pbc
will go around this loop twice to get
two queues and then end with an R</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
