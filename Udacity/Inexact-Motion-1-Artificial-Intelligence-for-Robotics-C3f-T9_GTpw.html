motion we again given five grid cells
and let's assume a robot executes its
action with high probability correctly
is your point eight pi with point one
chance it finds itself short of the
intended action and get another one
point one probability it finds itself
overshooting its target you can define
the same for other u values say u equals
1 then with point eight chance it would
end up over here point one it stays in
the same element in 0.1 it hops two
elements ahead now this is a model of in
Ecuador word motion this robot attempts
to go you grid cells but occasionally
falls short of its goal or overshoots
and it's a more common case robots as
they move a coup and certainty and it's
really important to model this because
this is the primary reason why
localization is hard because robots are
not very accurate so we're now going to
look into this first from the
mathematical side I will be giving you a
prior distribution and we're going to be
using the value u equals two and for the
motion model that shifts the robot
exactly two steps we believe there's a
point a chance and we assign a point one
to the cases where the robot overall
undershoots by exactly one that's kind
of written by this formula over here
where the two gets a point eight
probability the one and the three and
every day point one probability so what
I ask you now for the initial
distribution that I'm writing up here
can you give me the distribution after
the motion</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
