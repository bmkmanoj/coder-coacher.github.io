extend the privilege levels provided by
the UNIX file system semantics this
includes groups and subgroups and access
lists for files with both positive and
negative rights negative rights are
especially useful for quick revocation
further it also introduces the notion of
audit trail for system administrators
modifying the system I urge you to read
this paper in its entirety to get a feel
for the extensions proposed in the
Andrew filesystem the main takeaway
however in this lesson is how as
operating system designers we can take
the best solution that is out there for
information security and implement a
secure and usable distributed system
further once designed and implemented we
should be able to benchmark or a
solution against the design principles
laid out by saltzer on information
security and know the vulnerabilities
that exist in our solution this last
point is particularly important to
safeguard our system against attackers
as we mentioned at the outset of this
course module the topic of information
security is fascinating and it is of
high relevance in this information age
hopefully this course module has spurred
your interest in information security to
seek more in future courses</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
