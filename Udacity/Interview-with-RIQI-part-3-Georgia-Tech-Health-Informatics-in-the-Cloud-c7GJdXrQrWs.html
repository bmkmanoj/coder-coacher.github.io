this is the director of hie program
management here at Rhode Island quality
and a student current care thank you
very much for all time deals today a lot
of you we're mostly going to talk about
directing the direct services you
provide but before we do that as soon as
going to learn in the next lesson
patient privacy is always a concern when
when health data is being utilized
absolutely and can you briefly tell us
what pretation privacy model you use the
students going to learn about the
various models later on sure in Rhode
Island is a so-called opt-in state in
our case the opt-in is very strict we as
an hie we cannot even see your data
until you have given consent for us to
see it to collect it when you do give
your consent you under in the Rhode
Island model you give consent for all of
your data including sensitive data like
substance abuse treatment for example
you know also when you give consent
you're consenting to who can see your
data and you basically have three
choices the first choice is anyone
that's treating me a providing treatment
or coordination of care the second
choice is only in an emergency only in
an emergency can I will I allow anybody
to see my data and the third choice is
just for these providers and you
actually list them on the form well
that's interesting do you know off the
top of your head what percentage of
patients fall into each bucket
absolutely about a little over 95 96
percent that range select the first
option all of my providers about two to
three percent select emergencies only
and about half of one percent select the
third option just these providers just
skipping ahead for a second what's being
avoided here which we'll discuss a lot
in a lesson later under the course is
the issue of allowing patients to select
which data they want to share which is
very hard to do
absolutely in fact at a very challenging
topic this so called segmentation in
Rhode Island the law is all of your data
and that was basically the result of a
compromise between the consumer
advocates that wanted to be able to hold
certain data back and physicians that
said I need it all in order to provide
effective treatment on theta
segmentation will be a topic we look at
some detail later the second thing and
really the primary focus I hope is for
you to give us more detail Laura and I
talked reef ly about direct and the idea
that is used as a service but can you
give us more detail about the sorts of
things you're doing with direct sure
we're doing two things with direct one
is on the inbound side where we are
collecting data from data sharing
partners we use direct to get feeds of
continuity of care document ccds
students know what those are from the
instance of the EHR that they happen to
be using so if they're using for example
all scripts we worked with all scripts
so that the allscripts would generate a
proper ccd attach it to a direct message
and send it to the current care gateway
where it is checked to see whether that
patient has consented or not and if the
patient is consented it flows on into
current care otherwise it's blocked at
the gateway and I understood from
chatting with Laura that that process is
fairly automated at the provider in the
provider doesn't have to do that every
time very much so in fact it's automatic
once it's set up when the provider takes
a certain action like lock up the record
after an encounter the system
automatically does all this process of
creating the ccd and sending it off to
current care it's all completely
invisible to the practice I also know
from talking to Laura that you have a
fairly large number of EHR systems
implemented here in Rhode Island where
the vendor is pretty amenable to doing
this
I would say some were some weren't part
of the problem is that the vendors are
have a lot of priorities especially
meaningful use and so this implementing
this feed for the Rhode Island hae in
many cases has been way down the list
and we have to basically encourage the
practices that with that want to send us
data to go back to the EHR vendor and
tell them that I need you to do this for
me so what about some of the services go
the other way you've got the data now
I've got the data now now on the
outbound side the major service we
provide using direct our alerts there
are three kinds of alerts one is a
so-called hospital alert in that case we
receive a ATT transaction from a
hospital you've been admitted say to the
ER and in that transaction has been
entered the identification of your
primary care physician we look up that
primary care physician and if they're
subscribing to alerts then we create a
notification message and it's a very
simple email type message very little
information in the message itself and
send that off to the practice typically
that that message is received in an
inbox that's being monitored by a nurse
case manager and that person will decide
what to do with the message there's a
link in the message to current care to
the current care viewer so if they want
they can go in and
and review what the adt was in detail
along with all the other information
that's in current care what is the
adoption of these these alerts I mean
what right now we have here in Rhode
Island and we're a small state if but we
have a hundred fifty practices that have
subscribed and they represent about 400
to 500 subscriber providers individual
people and we generate about 5,000 five
and six thousand alerts per month to
that group this has been fascinating
thank you very much for taking the time
to you're welcome I have to speak with
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
