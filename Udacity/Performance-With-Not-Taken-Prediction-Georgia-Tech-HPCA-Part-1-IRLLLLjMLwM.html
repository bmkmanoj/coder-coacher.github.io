performance looks like when we refuse to
make any predictions let's see what the
performance is with the so called
not-taken prediction which amounts to
simply fetching the next instruction as
if none of the instructions was a taken
branch when we refuse to predict
anything a branch every branch would
cost us three cycles and even a non
branch instruction would cost us two
cycles even in a relatively shallow five
stage pipeline when we predict that the
instruction we are fetching is not a
taken branch we get that branch is now
cost us one or three cycles one cycle
for not taken branch three cycles for a
taken branch and a non branch
instruction always cost us one cycle
because in that case the note-taking
prediction is always correct so as we
can see the predict not-taken always
wins over refusing to predict for non
branches we are always one cycle better
for branches we are either the same or
two cycles better this is why every
processor that has a pipeline will do
some branch friction even if the
prediction it is doing is simply
increment the PC and fetch the next
instruction note that that type of
prediction is really cheap
all you have to do is increment the PC
you don't actually have to know anything
about branches or other instructions so
it's very easy to do it you have to be
able to increment the PC anyway</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
