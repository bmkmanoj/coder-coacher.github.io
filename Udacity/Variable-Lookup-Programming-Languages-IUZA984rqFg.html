with a quiz we're gonna go back to our
JavaScript interpreter and add support
for looking up variables like X and y
the first change is that our recursive
evaluate expression procedure now takes
two arguments the abstract syntax tree
and the environment because we've just
established that the meaning of an
expression depends on the context in the
world depends on the environment we've
already seen these two cases before we
peel apart our abstract syntax tree
which is just a bunch of nested tuples
we look in the zeroth component for the
type if it's a number node then we just
return the string value converted to an
integer if it's a binary operator like
plus or minus we'll have to do the
addition or subtraction here I'm
skipping a few steps compared to last
time last time we assigned tree one to
left child and then called eval exp on
it I'm gonna do it all in one line now
just to save little space but notice
that when I make my recursive calls to
add E or to eval exp I have to pass in
this environment in order to have my sub
children the sub parts of the ast know
what the values of variables are and
since there haven't been any intervening
assignment statements the environment
stays the same whatever I was given is
whatever I will pass on to my sub trees
so now I just check to see if the
operator is a JavaScript plus I evaluate
it using Python plus if the operator is
JavaScript - I evaluate it using Python
- I translate these basic Universal
concepts like addition and subtraction
from one language to another I'm writing
an interpreter but what if instead of
being a number or a binary operator our
node type is identifier is actually a
reference to a variable and just to
remind you here I've written out our
abstract syntax tree for X plus 2 at the
highest level it's a binary operator
where the left child is the identifier X
and the right child is the number 2 so
we started up here with been off but
that involves calling ourselves
recursively to evaluate our left child
when we do the node type for our left
child is identifier so we're gonna have
to figure out what the value of x is so
your mission is to complete the code for
this case by finding the identifier name
look
get up in the environment and returning
it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
