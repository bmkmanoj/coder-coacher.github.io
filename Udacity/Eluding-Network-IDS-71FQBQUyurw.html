defeat the ideas so that his attack can
go undetected the code that an ideas
performs passive monitoring that is a
network ideas here's a copy of the
network traffic and analyzes it law the
traffic is reaching the end hosts
therefore in order for the ideas to
detect the intrusion that's happening at
the end hosts he must see the same
traffic as the end hosts however this is
not always the case an attacker can
exploit this in order to evade the ideas
the reason that the ideas and the end
hosts are seeing different traffic is
because they are using two different
operating systems that process traffic
in different ways in particular tcp/ip
protocol specifications have ambiguities
they lead to different implementations
in different operating systems as a
result if the IDS runs on unix and the
end hosts runs on Windows they may not
process certain packets exactly the same
way for example options such as time to
live or error conditions associated with
fragments and checksums a handle in
different ways in different operating
systems by exploiting these evidences
the attacker hopes that the ideas would
not see the attack traffic yet the end
hosts will be affected by the attack
traffic as intended by the attacker</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
