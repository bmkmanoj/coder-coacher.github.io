about slam there was a request popular
request actually in email on discussion
forum so slam is a method for mapping
it's short for simultaneous localization
and mapping and some of this might show
up and the final exam so do pay
attention mapping is all about building
maps of the environment you might
remember in the localization classes we
assumed the map was given one of my big
passions in my life has been to
understand how to make a robot make
these maps like this map over here which
is a 3d map of an abandoned underground
coal mine in Pennsylvania near Carnegie
Mellon University over the past 10 years
or so I've worked on a number of
different methods for building maps that
are quite sophisticated like this
particular method over here that you can
see in all these maps have in common
that we build a model of the environment
while also addressing the fact that it
over itself accrues uncertainty while it
moves so when in this example here the
loop is being closed you can see how our
mapping technology is able to
accommodate this and find a consistent
map despite the fact the robot drifted
along the way so the key insights
invading apps is that the robot itself
might lose track of where is by virtue
of its motion uncertainty the
accomodated is in localization by using
the existing map but now we don't have
an existing map rebuilding the map
that's why slam comes into play slam
doesn't stand for slamming a robot what
it really means is simultaneous
localization and mapping this is a big
big big research field most of my AI
book is about this technology and today
I want to show you my favorite method
called graph slam which is also by far
the easiest method to understand we will
reduce the mapping problem to a couple
of very intuitive additions into a big
matrix and a vector and that's it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
