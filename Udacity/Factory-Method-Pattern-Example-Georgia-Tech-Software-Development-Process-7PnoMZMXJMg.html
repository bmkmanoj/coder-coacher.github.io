a class called image reader factory
which provides the factory method which
is this one create image reader as you
can see the method takes an input stream
as input and returns an object of type
image reader and it's static so that we
can invoke it even if we don't have an
instance of the image reader Factory
so what does the Met to do well the
method first invokes get image type
passing the input stream as a parameter
and this method figures out the type of
the image that is stored in this input
stream and it's an integer then based on
the value of this integer the method
does one of several things if the image
type is a gif it will invoke the
constructor for gif reader passing the
stream as a parameter and what will
happen is that the gif reader will read
a gif from the stream create the
corresponding object and return it so in
this case the image reader object
returned will be the object representing
a gif as appropriate similarly if the
image type is JPEG then the method will
invoke the constructor for JPEG reader
and in this case this constructor will
read from the stream a JPEG create a
corresponding object and return it and
so on for different types of images so
why is this a situation in which it is
appropriate to use the factory method
pattern well because it corresponds
exactly to the cases that we saw before
of applicability this is a case in which
we don't know the type of the object
that we need to create until we run the
code because it depends on the value of
the input stream it depends on the
content of the input stream so until we
read the input stream we cannot figure
out whether we need to create a gif a
JPEG or some other type of image so in
this case we wanna do we wanna simply
delegate to these classes the creation
of the object once we know what type of
object needs to be created so perfect
example of application of a factory
method pattern</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
