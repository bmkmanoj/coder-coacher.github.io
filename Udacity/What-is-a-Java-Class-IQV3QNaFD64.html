the textview class which would be saved
in the textview Java file we simplified
it so it'd be easier for you to
understand what a class would look like
first it starts with an access modifier
it's marked as public so that other
things like an activity can use this
textview class then we have the word
class this indicates to Java that this
is a class definition then we have the
name of the class the name of a class in
Java starts with a capital letter and
it's in camel case so there's no spaces
and a capitalized subsequent words
there's some other text here but we'll
look into that later the important thing
is we have an opening brace and then at
the bottom of the definition we have a
closing brace now inside this textview
class we have a bunch of variables here
each of these represents a field in the
textview so we have a field for the text
of the text view and a field for the
text color of the textview there are
other fields as well but remember this
is the simplified version of the
textview class we also have a variable
to store a reference to the context of
the application you can read more about
context in instructor notes below but
it's basically a way to access
information about the app like for
example you can access resources in the
app using the context and these are the
methods of the textview the set text
method takes us input a text string then
it updates the global variable m text to
use this new value similarly the set
text color takes us input a new color
and it updates the internal state to
have this new color value
there's also methods like get text and
get text color which return the internal
text string or the internal text color
one more thing you may have noticed that
these global variables here all start
with a lowercase M M stands for a member
variable and these are all member
variables of this textview class member
variable is just another way to say
field or the state of the text view
class here's a simplified image view
class you would find it in the image
view Java file it starts with public
class and then image view is the name of
the class and then
we have opening and closing braces this
makes up the state of the image view
normally it would have more fields than
this but I just want to show you an
example this is an integer variable and
it's called M image ID M for a member
variable this stores the resource ID for
the image that should be shown in this
image view down here we have the
constructor which is used to construct a
new image view object and it takes us
input a context and then it initializes
these variables then we have a method
it's called set image and it takes its
input a resource ID for the new image
that should be shown in this image view
inside this method we update the
internal variable for image ID again we
created these simplified text view and
image view classes to help you
understand the concept of classes now
let's look at the real version of these
classes inside the android framework to
see the code for the Java classes in
Android you can install this Chrome
extension if you're not using the Chrome
browser you can see the instructor notes
below for how to access these files ok
once that Chrome extension is installed
then when I search for something like
textview Android and I go look at the
reference documentation for this class
then there's going to be this extra link
here that says view source this is
really for advanced developers if you're
curious about the code that is used to
create this text view this is a textview
Java file that was defined by someone on
the Android team as you can see it's
really long and complex but it still has
the main parts of a class it starts with
public class and then texts you the name
of the class and then this is the
opening brace and the closing brace is
all the way at the bottom here at the
top of the class we see a bunch of
fields here and this makes up the state
of the class for example we see that
text color is a field we also see that
text is a field and here's the
constructor for textview that takes us
input a context if I hit command F or
ctrl F if you are on Windows then I can
try to search for a set text and here's
the set text method this method is going
to set the string value of the textview
and if I search forget text and I also
see this method returns the text that
the textview is displaying you get the
idea and you can browse through this on
your own if you want if I search for the
image view documentation page then I can
click on view source to view all the
code for the image view class the file
says public class image view and then
these are the fields that make up the
state of the image view and then there's
a bunch of methods at the bottom of the
file the code in this file is pretty
complex as well and it's also thousands
of lines of code the best part about
object oriented programming though is
that you don't need to know about all
these details as a developer you can use
text view and image view in your app
without knowing about all the gory
details of what's going on inside of it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
