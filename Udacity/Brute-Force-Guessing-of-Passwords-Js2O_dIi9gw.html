this brute force guessing they'll have
to get hold of the shadow password files
and it there Linda hash values but let's
say there's a compromise of the system
and that file is exfiltrated or
something like that in fact in the past
year to they've been several examples
where linkedin and adobe and others had
these password derived values from
password files those were stolen by
hackers and actually made widely
available so if you have these hash
values let's say if you get hold of them
you doing brute-force guessing of
passwords how hard is this task one
thing we can do is we have some hardware
software and you know whatever hash
function here we're talking md5 it's one
of the hash functions that is used
publicly available software that we have
and certain kind of hardware that is
common and quite popular for graphics
GPUs a graphics processing unit and
they're particularly well-suited for
doing password kind of calculations or
brute force kind of attacks we're
talking about so a GPU with available
software can do 10 to the power 8 so
that's 100 million hashes it can compute
and check per second okay so if the
password is only let's say six random
upper or lowercase at 26 uppercase 26
lowercase or digits that'll give us 62
total number of characters if you have
62 possibilities and if it's six
character long the first character there
are 62 choices the second character the
sixty two choices the sixth character
that sixty two choices so total number
of possible passwords we can have is 62
x 62 six times or 60 to the power 6 if
you actually do your calculation you see
how much that is divide that number by
10 to the power 8 because that's how
many we can do per second if you try to
find that out you'll see that this
calculation or this boot force attack
guessing attack we're talking about can
be carried out in about 10 minutes well
one thing we do is we increase the size
of the past
we asked people to pick longer passwords
so from six if we go to eight of course
the effort for that hacker is going to
go up it's going to go from minutes to
two days but if you take eight random
characters of the same kind you would
actually get 60 to the power 8 because
there are 62 choices for each if you add
special characters the calculation would
change a little bit but if you calculate
this number again divide this by 10 to
the power 8 it's going to give you six
days you don't have to limit yourself if
you that hacker to one GPU if you add
GPU this kind of computation can be done
in parallel and you can reduce the time
if it's too long but the idea here is
that brute force guessing of passwords
even when they're reasonable respectable
length is certainly doable for for an
attacker</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
