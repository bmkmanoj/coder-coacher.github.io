dilation and erosion we have to talk
about something called the structuring
element okay the structuring element is
a mask okay it's a shape that you're
going to use to do these operations and
it can be any shape for today the shapes
are going to be just ones and zeroes
they can also be one zeros and X's and
the X's are don't cares but nothing
we're going to talk about today will
will involve don't care so I'm not going
to talk about it what's important about
the shape is that they all are defined
inspect is sometimes called an anchor or
reference point or an origin right and
usually not always usually that origin
is in the middle of whatever shape
you're making use of okay so given a
structuring element we can define both
dilation and erosion so dilation is as
follows basically I've got some binary
image B okay and that's here I've got a
structuring element s and the
structuring element has to have an
origin basically what you do is you're
going to take this dilation structuring
element and you're going to run it
around here placing the origin at
different places and wherever you place
it you're going to take the or of all of
the ones in the structuring element with
the ones underneath it and so what that
means is if any of the ones land of the
structuring element land on a one in the
binary image the or of all that will be
one so arpund did this and he's very
proud so there's my structuring element
and he there he goes yeah very good cool
all right so you basically run it all
over and what the result of this okay
is this val is this thing here and let's
just take a look at that right these are
our two original ones okay so when I put
this structuring element down here like
that nothing was a 1 in fact as I slide
it all along nothing is a 1 so those are
all zeros right but when I put my
structuring element here notice it
overlaps there ok so this value which is
the origin for that first position that
gets a 1 and as I slide it along that's
how I get the the
the rest of these so that's dilation by
a particular shape now I'll tell you
sometimes you'll dilate by sort of a
funny shape like that usually your shape
will be symmetric sometimes it'll be
taller than it is wide because you're
trying to extend things in one direction
as opposed to another but this cutout
kind of thing would be a little bit
unusual in fact here's a nice example so
here's a binary text and you can see
that there's white pixels but they've
got lots of you know if you take a look
at that em you can see it's kind of a
bunch of little spots in there that seem
to have some holes in it so if I use a
structuring element that looks like this
that essentially says if I touch anybody
to my right left up or below I want to
turn on the pixel and when I do that you
get the really much better result right
I mean it's much easier to read the one
on the left than one on the right one on
the right might be uglier okay because
it doesn't look so crisp but there's no
question about reading it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
