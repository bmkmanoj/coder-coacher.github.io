while and then suddenly the person who
is playing that game announces last
round so this is the last chance for you
to play the game and the odds already
looked pretty good and also the last
forty times that you checked actually
nobody lost what would be the factors
you would have to take into account to
determine if and how much to bet in this
last round now of course this is a
rather subjective quiz but I think we
should agree more or less so I'll give
you four opinions that you could have
and I also think that more more than one
of them are valid so the first opinion
could be certainly because the odds are
fantastic you get thirty percent back if
you throw a one two three four or five
so that will give you thirty percent
profit and in the last forty throws no
six was thrown and the probability for
that is smaller than 0.1 percent or
maybe your opinion is well you can play
a little you know your your chances of
winning thirty percent that's fine but
you should be ready to lose what you're
betting here the third option could be
that it kind of depends on your risk
affinity so if you're ready to play a
riskier game you might want to bet a
little bit more or stay out of the game
altogether and finally one opinion could
be well better not because it does seem
a little bit suspicious</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
