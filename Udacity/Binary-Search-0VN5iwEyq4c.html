dive into basic algorithms let's say you
have an array sorted in numerical order
and you want to see if a number that you
have exists in this array if you start
at the front and check every number in
the array the time could be Big O of n
if your number is really big the same
happens if you start at the other end
you could have a really small number and
it might end up taking linear time in
worst case however we could do a cool
trick here that takes advantage of the
fact that you have a sorted array rather
than starting at the end let's say you
started in the middle of the array you
could say is my number bigger or smaller
than the one in the middle
since my number is bigger I know that
it'll have to be in the second half of
the array now I don't even have to
search the first half of the array the
best thing about this strategy is that
you can make the same assumption again
just on the second half of the array
check the middle element and then move
forward from there my number is still
bigger than the middle of this array so
now I only have to check the last
element and now we're at the end we've
checked nineteen and twenty nine two
numbers side by side and we still don't
see 25 thus we can conclude 25 does not
exist in our array guess what you just
learned an algorithm an algorithm is
really just a high-level description of
a trick for solving a problem this one
happens to be called binary search</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
