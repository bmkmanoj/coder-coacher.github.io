participants that is he told him exactly
what the study was about and he made it
very clear to them that they never hurt
anybody but that's not to say that the
study was without controversy in fact
remember that the participants really
experienced serious and real mental
anguish and distress when they thought
they were hurting people now in fact
only five percent of the people though
said that they regretted participating
in the study but the controversy was
started after Milgram there was a real
serious debate in and outside of
psychology about what was ethically okay
in human research so let's look more
carefully at the ethics of Stanley
Milgram study so what is it that he
first did well he first recruited
participants by telling them that this
was a study on learning and punishment
and we now know that was a lie that was
deceptive but is that okay is it okay in
this case to use that kind of deception
in research what do you think</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
