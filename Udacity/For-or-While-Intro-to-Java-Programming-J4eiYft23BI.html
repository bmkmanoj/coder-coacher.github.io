and the for loop and now you have
choices and which look to take and
choices aren't always easy so let's look
at a typical problem let's say we have
ten thousand dollars and we get ten
percent interest and we want to know
what happens to our nest egg over a
period of 30 years which loop should we
take now in this case what's going to
drive our decision is the fact that we
know we want to do something 30 times
and when you know how often you want to
do it then the for loop is what you want
to choose over here I've modified our
program to do this here you've seen I've
changed the balance to 10,000 I've
changed the interest rate to ten percent
and I have now that I want 30 years and
then I just write my loop here where the
here goes from 1 to the number of years
gets incremented every time and inside
here you have the familiar computation
of the interest so notice that in this
loop I know exactly how many times the
loop is going to execute namely this
many times 30 times let me run the
program here you see the output you see
the interest in starting at one scrolled
off at the top and it went 30 times
that's the classic case for the for loop
contrast that with the example of the
first program that we had where we
wanted to become a millionaire at that
point we used a while loop because we
did not know how many years it was going
to take for us to achieve our lofty goal
when you don't know how many iterations
you want the while loop tends to be the
better choice so that simply is your
criterion for a decision do you know how
many times the loop runs you usually
choose a for loop if you don't know you
usually choose a while</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
