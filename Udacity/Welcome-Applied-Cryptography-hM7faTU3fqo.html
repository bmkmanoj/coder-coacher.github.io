and I'm here with Adam Sherwin Jobe is
sick today so Adam is kindly stepped in
Adam is one of our new tas who's going
to be tearing a statistics course that
will be starting fairly soon so thanks
Adam what questions do we have for today
so Elsa astron ssin asked about the math
used in unit 3 specifically what is Z
sub Q so this is a good question and and
I have been fairly informal with the
math that we use in this class that I
want to focus on the fun parts of crypto
but really to understand things it's
important to understand that math deeply
and so i will put a link to there's some
great free notes from an MIT course that
goes into a lot of detail on the math
that will have a good definition of this
on the specific question of what Z sub Q
is this means the group of integers over
multiplication so if Q is a prime number
that is all the numbers less than from
one up to that prime number of minus one
and a group is defined by the set of
elements and operations so we use the
numerals that we understand to show the
members of the group but they could be
any symbol what matters is what the
operations do on those elements and the
multiplicative groups on integers have
the properties that correspond to what
we think about integer multiplication
having except for modulo the size of the
group and when it's a prime these are
very useful for cryptography so that's
what i mean by Z sub Q it's the multiple
group of integers so it's the numbers
from 1 up to Q minus 1 and when q is
prime that's the same thing as you start
q which is what you'll sometimes hear it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
