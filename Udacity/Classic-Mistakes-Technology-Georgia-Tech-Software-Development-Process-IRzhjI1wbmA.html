want to measure are technology related
mistakes one typical mistake in this
context is the Silver Bullet syndrome
what does that mean well the Silver
Bullet syndrome refers to situations in
which there is too much reliance on the
advertised benefits of some previously
unused technology for example a new
technology and the problem here is that
we cannot expect technology alone to
solve our software development issues so
we should not rely too much on
technology alone another typical mistake
is to switch or add tools in the middle
of a project and sometimes it can make
sense to upgrade a tool but introducing
new tools which can have a steep
learning curve as almost always negative
effects finally a common unforgivable
mistake is the lack of an automated
version control system for your code and
for your various artifacts manual and ad
hoc solutions are just not an option it
is way too easy to make mistakes use
out-of-date versions be unable to find a
previous working version and so on I saw
that happening many times and it always
results in a disaster so be warned use a
version control system and an automated
one and actually we will use version
control systems in our projects</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
