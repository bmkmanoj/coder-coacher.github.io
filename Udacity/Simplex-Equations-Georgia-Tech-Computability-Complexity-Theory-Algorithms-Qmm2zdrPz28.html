efficient approach called the simplex
algorithm this actually will not be
polynomial time in the worst case but as
a practical matter this algorithm is
efficient enough to be widely used the
simplex algorithm allows us to move from
one basic feasible solution to a better
one and by moving to better and better
basic feasible solutions we eventually
reach the optimum for convenience let's
suppose that our current basis consists
of the first M columns of a will call
this sub matrix B and the remaining sub
matrix D it will also be convenient to
partition X and C in an analogous
fashion overall then we can write our
standard form than your program like so
CB transpose times X B plus C D
transpose times XD subject to the
constraints that B times X B plus D
times XD must be equal to B and of
course both xB and XD must be
non-negative for the simplex algorithm
we want to consider the effects of
swapping out one of the current basis
columns for another one to do this we
first want to identify a good candidate
for moving into the basis one that will
improve the objective function as the
program stands however it's not
immediately clear which if any are good
candidates sure for some X I in XD here
the corresponding coefficient might be
positive but raising the value of that
variable might force others to change
because of the constraints making the
whole picture rather opaque therefore it
will be convenient to parameterize our
ability to move around in the flat
defined by these constraints solely in
terms of the variables in XD the
variables that we're thinking about
moving into the basis by the way I'll
use the idea of moving variables and
moving columns into the basis
interchangeably throughout to this end
we solve the Equality constraint for X B
so that we can substitute for it where
desired first we substitute it into the
objective function
and through them little manipulation we
get this expression this constant term
here doesn't matter since we're only
considering the effects of changing XD
this quantity that gets multiplied with
XD however is important enough that it
deserves its own name we'll call it rd
in our reframing of the problem
therefore we want to maximize our d
transpose x XD how about the other
constraints well the first one goes away
with the substitution this requirement
however that XB be non-negative remains
substituting our equation for x b we get
the constraint shown here of course XD
must remain non-negative as well note
that XD equals 0 the current situation
for the algorithm is feasible and it's
easy to see a way to improve the
objective value just by looking at the
vector rd our real goal however is not
just a climb uphill but to figure out
which column should enter the basis</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
