general than just the prisoner's dilemma
or iterated prisoner's dilemma and in
fact led to a result that I like to call
the computational folk theorem the idea
the computational folk theorem says that
you give me any to player by matrix game
what's up I'm an trees game just that
there's two players okay so it seems
kind of redundant doesn't it
what makes it by matrix as opposed to
two player zero-sum game which you can
write down with the single matrix this
is like each each player has its own
reward matrix I see but you're right I
should have I could have just said by
matrix game and left out the two player
and it's an average reward repeated game
so we're gonna play round after round
after round and we're gonna look at the
average reward or you can also think of
it as discounted with an extremely high
discount factor okay so you give me one
of those games and what I can do is I
can build a Pavlov like machine for for
any of these games and use that to
construct a sub game perfect Nash
equilibrium for any of these games in
polynomial time so and the way that this
works is if it is possible for us to
have some kind of mutually beneficial
relationship then I can build a pavlon
like machine quickly if not then the
game is actually zero-sum like right
because in a zero-sum game we can't
mutually benefit so we can't do anything
like Pavlov we're just gonna beat each
other up so we can actually solve a
linear program in polynomial time and
work out what the strategies would be if
we're playing a zero-sum like game and
so either that works and produces a Nash
equilibrium and we can test that or it
doesn't work but it most one player can
improve its behavior and by taking that
best response against what the other
player does in a zero-sum like sense
then that will be a Nash equilibrium so
there's three possible forms of the Nash
equilibrium but we can tick through
these figure out which one is right and
derive the actual strategies in
polynomial time wow that's pretty
impressive who came up with this idea so
this is a result due to Peter stone and
somebody oh yeah me oh well that's very
impressive so you managed to find a way
to sneak in some of your own work into
this class here let's do some more of
that okay I'm a big fan
and I think that's fair because I did
that way back win on mimic mimic so yes
so what the last topic this is that's
all I really wanted to say about the
folk theorem and repeated games what I'd
like to do now is move to stochastic
games which is a generalization of
repeated games and talk a little bit
about how this relates back to things
like q-learning and MVPs oh okay that
sounds almost sounds like you're
wrapping up it is that and that will be
the end of into the new material Wow so
that means we're coming towards the end
of the entire course I know we're gonna
all cry with disappointment and I think
and I just say this you know as an idol
suggestion that the students should
demand that we teach more classes I
concur
so let's get there so that they can
demand</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
