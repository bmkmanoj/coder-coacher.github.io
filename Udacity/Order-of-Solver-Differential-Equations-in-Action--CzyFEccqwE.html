and you can see as the step size
increases by a factor of 10 the error
increases by a factor of 10 to the 5
remember forward Euler verse of order of
one horn was of order to this is a
solver of order five greet this the
other way around as you shrink the step
size by a factor of 10 the air or
decreases by a factor of 10 to the five
that's a huge gain and you can see that
this solver when you take steps of three
minutes around earth gets back to where
it started within just millimeters this
is quite an efficient method it's called
The Hunger Goethe feedback method now
assume that with all these strange
numbers we mistyped one namely we didn't
end our 56,000 for 30 but we entered 56
431 let's look at the result this
doesn't look that great anymore we've
got an error that's well above one
kilometre so getting these numbers right
would among other things belong to
