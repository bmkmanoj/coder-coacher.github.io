and we're looking at this angle this is
what we'll call a reference angle for
now we have three sides we can talk
about now this one the largest side will
always be called the hypotenuse so I'm
going to abbreviate the hypotenuse with
hyp this side here at the bottom is
opposite the angle we're referring to so
let's call that the opposite side this
side being next to the angle is adjacent
I'm going to label that adj and Jason
just means next - and one thing to be
careful of it's not to call this side
the adjacent side even though yes it is
next to this angle we give this one the
special name hypotenuse because it is
the longest side now if we think back to
our sides from before our side lengths
we had five meters 12 meters and a
hypotenuse of 13 meters what we now know
is that anytime we have a similar
triangle to this one so a right triangle
with an angle of twenty-two point six
degrees here the ratio of opposite to
adjacent will always always be five over
twelve this ratio is so important that
we're going to give it its own name and
so the first trigonometric ratio you're
going to learn is the tangent and the
tangent of an angle is always equal to
the opposite over the adjacent which in
this case would have been five over
twelve I would write that by saying the
tangent of twenty two point six degrees
equals five over twelve but that's not
the only ratio we can talk about we can
also compare the opposite to the
hypotenuse when we do that we're using
what's called a sine so I should note
that I'm making abbreviations here tan
for tangent si n for sine sine is just
the opposite over the hypotenuse can you
tell me what would the sine of twenty
two point six degrees be remember the
tangent of twenty two point six was five
over twelve what's the sine entering
your answer here so you can enter it as
a fraction with the numerator up here
and the denominator down here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
