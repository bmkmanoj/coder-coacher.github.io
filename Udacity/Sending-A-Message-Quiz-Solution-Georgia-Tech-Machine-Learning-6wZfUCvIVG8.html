bits for each of those 10 flips but in
the second case we don't need any bits
because the result of the flip is always
going to be the same you don't even have
to send this message the folks at San
Francisco will already know what is the
result of those 10 flips so realize what
we discovered here if the output of this
coin is predictable you don't need to
communicate anything but if the output
is random you need to communicate the
result of each and every flip so more
information has to be transmitted if the
sequence is predictable or it has less
uncertainty then it has less information
Shannon described this measure as
entropy he said if you had to predict
the next symbol in a sequence what is
the minimum number of years or no
questions you would expect to ask in the
first example you have to ask a
yes-or-no question for every coin flip
so you have to ask at least one question
for every flip in the unfair coin you
don't have to ask any questions so the
information in the second case is zero
while the information is in the first
case is 1 let's consider another example
to understand this better</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
