find the public interface of another
class now let's go back to our core
class we had discovered the public
interface that you see over here and now
our goal is to implement it so imagine a
car object and let's have a look at the
add gas method we're adding a certain
amount of gas and what should that do to
the car well remember it's not a real
car and it's not real gas this car is
just an object in a computer and it
remembers some information in particular
in order to add gas the car needs to
remember how much gas it has in Java you
use variables to remember anything and
here is how you write such a variable
the variable has a name just like the
variables that you've seen in the
previous lesson as well as a type and
then there is this keyword private here
that simply means that the variables of
an object are a part of the private
implementation the programmer who uses
the public interface doesn't need to
know about them you will always want to
declare instance variables as private
let me tell you why they're called
instance variables let's have a look at
another car object or as we say another
instance of the car class of course it
also needs to remember how much gas it
has and the amount of gas that this
object has will be different from the
amount of gas of the other object so
each of these objects or each of these
instances of the car class needs to have
its own variable to store that
information that's what it means to be
an instance variable it's a variable
that occurs in every instance of the
class now there's another thing that
each car object should remember namely
its mileage here is how you can define
the variable we give it a name miles
driven its type it's again a number and
once again each instance of the car
class has its own value so it needs its
own copy of that variable these are the
two instance variables that we need for
the car class you will soon see how the
methods of the car class update or read
those instance variables but first go
ahead and practice with Sarah how to
discover the instance variables that we
need for the person class</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
