linear and the number of transfers is at
least n over L now let's analyze a
concrete algorithm to see whether or not
we can achieve this lower bound now
here's the natural thing you would write
in the conventional Ram model that is
the one without the fast memory it
maintains an accumulator s and makes a
sweep over all the elements accumulating
them now you need to modify this
procedure to think about when to move
data between slow and fast memory now
the variable s is easy you can just
assume that it starts locally in the
fast memory it's the same way you might
treat any temporary scalar or local
variable in your favorite imperative
programming language for my pseudo code
I've just declared s to be local now I'm
doing that just to be clear most of the
time you can ignore these kinds of local
variables now what about the array X for
simplicity let's assume that little n is
much bigger than the size of fast memory
let's further assume that X is aligned
on an l word boundary with these
assumptions let's transform the program
to make slow and fast memory transfers
explicit yikes let's start with the
outer loop as with the original
algorithm it steps through the elements
of the array but it does so one block of
size l at a time next there's the
computation l hat this mumbo-jumbo just
determines whether the block that starts
at position I is of length L or a little
bit smaller it's a detail I just wanted
to be clear but most of the time we'll
ignore this sort of detail next there's
the assignment to little wide this is an
explicit load or read from slow memory
too fast memory notice that a requests
at most L words which is one block
transfer now since little Y&amp;amp;S are both
local too fast memory the processor can
execute this innermost loop so what's
the work and the number of transfers for
this algorithm the work is just the same
as the conventional algorithm in the
ramp model that is it's just fate of n
here's the number of transfers it's just
the ceiling of an over L hopefully you
can see how this falls out very
naturally from the structure of the code
so how do these compare to the lower
bounds why they compare very well indeed
before moving on I want to make two
remarks about what you've just done
first I realize there was a lot of
painful detail to do what must seem like
a really simple analysis we will make
simplifications as we go but I wanted to
start by just being clear about exactly
what has to happen under the hood in
this model now my second remark yes I
know about caches there are those fast
memory thingies that the hardware
manages automatically in fact there's an
awesome OMS CS class that covers their
design in a lot of detail while caches
are very useful what you'll eventually
see is that they aren't sufficient to
guarantee high performance that is why
we're discussing an explicit model of
locality like this one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
