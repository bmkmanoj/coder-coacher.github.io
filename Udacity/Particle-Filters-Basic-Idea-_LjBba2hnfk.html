you should know in particle filtering
the measurements are typically referred
to as the Z's Z sub T and not as Y of T
it was just the way it was done it has
to do with whether you're connected to
vision or robotics in order to so that
aligns with various papers and other
formulations you see we're going to
start showing Z's in the slides to come
it also made it much easier to borrow
slides from other people because they
were using the Z's all right so the key
to sort of particle filtering is the
following if we have a distribution and
here we have a nice little distribution
which you see is I don't know what that
distribution is but I know one thing
it's not Gaussian now somebody who's
really smart out there might say well it
looks to me like a mixture of gaussians
well it sort of looks to me like a
mixture of gaussians yeah in this
particular case maybe it is that's just
for convenience of drawing and in fact
there is a relationship between mixtures
of gaussians and particle filters which
we won't even talk about but basically
ideas you have a bunch of things which
together represent your density in
particle filters or sample based methods
what you have is you have a set of
particles and here the particles are
drawn out where you can see these
particles it says X T that means these
happen to be our particles at time T and
there's n of them and you know the
bigger n is the better and notice it
says waited here in parentheses because
sometimes they're weighted or sometimes
they all have the same weight if the
density is represented by sort of where
the particles are so you see we have a
nice high density here so we have lots
and lots of particles there okay not so
many particles here not so many here and
lots of them there all right so that's
where they are and if they were weighted
it would be as if you you can think of
that as having two particles in the same
spot if I double the weight it'd be like
having two particles at the same spot
and now you can say that the probability
density that X is some value is
essentially the probability if you were
to draw out a particle that you would
get a particle whose value is really
really close to that spot okay and
that's what it means to you
samples or particles to represent
particular density and if you're doing
that then your overall goal is you want
sort of as n gets bigger the idea is
that the probability of getting a point
from this distribution that's X is an
element of X T is approximately what the
underlying probability was and for
tracking the idea is given everything
we've observed so far so what are our
arms and patients remember their Z's so
given everything that we've observed so
far
what's our belief about where X is and
we want to end up with a set of
particles that gives us that density</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
