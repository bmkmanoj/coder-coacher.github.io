l-1 and we can notice that both of these
have a factor of 10 so let's just go
ahead and pull that out so factoring out
that 10 and then also distributing this
minus sign to both terms inside the
second parentheses gives us this 10
times log of 2 P minus log of B minus
log of P plus log of B something that
pops out in this expression is that we
have a minus log of V &amp;amp; A plus log of B
so these two things are going to cancel
each other out awesome that's how we get
rid of that be and that's why we didn't
need to know its actual value looking at
what this equation reduces to then we
can see how much simpler everything is
we still however have another variable
left in here what do we do with this P
well I think we have to bring back our
quotient rule again but this time we're
going to use it in the reverse order
from how we did before we're going to
condense this expression into just a
single log this gives us 10 times log
base 10 of 2 P over P well and look at
that if we divide to P by P these peas
just cancel each other out that's going
to leave us with something super easy 10
times log base 10 of 2 this is just a
number let's use the calculator to
evaluate this we have 10 times log base
10 of 2 that's equal to three point zero
one etc which I went around to just
three so our answer is about three
decibels</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
