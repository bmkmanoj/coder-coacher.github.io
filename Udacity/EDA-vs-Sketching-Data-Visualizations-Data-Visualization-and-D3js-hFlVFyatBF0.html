distinction between sketching with the
visualization and something like EDA is
the exploratory data analysis is
typically performed when you are
exploring the structure and values of
the data to find insights erroneous
values or are there features of your
data set that are inherent to the form
of the data itself sketching in contrast
is performed to experiment with the
visual display of the data and explore
the best visual in coatings for the
given data values and types one last
point about the distinction between
something like EDA and sketching is the
EDA is often thought of between yourself
and the data it's for you to discover
insights in your data and figure out the
right questions to ask sketching on the
other hand is to communicate some
insights to others this is iterating and
prototyping the best way to visually
display some insight that you have
already found this is somewhat similar
to the distinction that the grammar of
graphics makes between the data and the
aesthetic think of sketching as
iterating on the visual aesthetic and
eda as iterating on the data itself do
you think a scatter plot is better
suited for this data than a bar plot
often people use a scatter plot to
display time series and distributions
and while it can work for these types of
things just like a chef wouldn't use a
butcher's knife to cut vegetables I
think a scatter plot is better suited
for data where each field on the x-axis
is not correlated with itself what do I
mean by this exactly well given time one
year is implicitly dependent on the year
that came before it a subtle distinction
about why not to use a scatter plot for
this data set is similar to a lot of the
choices that front end designers make
for common user interface best practices
for example it is very rare that you see
a site with the horizontal scroll going
left to right rather than vertically up
two down if you've seen I spaces new
site redesign you'll know that there are
an exception and the reason why sites
often don't do this is because it can be
very disorienting
a user since 99 percent of sites
probably more out there scroll
vertically if a user Scrolls the mouse
up or down rather than horizontally and
they come to expect this behavior for
every site if the site Maps strolling up
and down to actually horizontal action
on the page from left and right it's not
wrong or incorrect but simply just
unconventional and in the same vein if
people come to know a scatter plot to
represent data where the X values are
uncorrelated and independent they might
assume that the data that you've chosen
to represent by a scatter plot has X
values that are independent and
uncorrelated so in this case a scatter
plot actually succumbs to the same
issues as the bar plot and actually
doesn't highlight the missing data as
well so I even a little worse in my
opinion</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
