going to this might be the last one of
the lectures on just sort of this
collection of stuff that it maybe not be
thought of as core computer vision but
just stuff that I thought you guys
should be exposed to one way the other I
also want to give a shout out to a
Kelsie Hawkins who helped produce some
of the material here so that's supposed
to all the other people that I stole
things from since Kelsey's actually my
student and put this talk together I
thought I would I would do that but
today I want to talk to you a little
about a little bit about depth sensing I
would say that this is tremendously
driven by the fact that there's a lot of
work recently in computer vision dealing
for robotics the recovery of depth
previously had been a bit back in the
60s 70s 80s had been a big focus of
computer vision then things sort of
moved away into more certain motion
things labeling stuff processing a video
to extract stuff and of course
processing all the images on the web but
in the last decade or so with the growth
of robotics this goal to be able to
visually extract information from the
scene for a robot and a lot of that
information that's desired is about the
geometry of what's out there where is
there stuff where is there not stuff
what things are on the table how would I
pick them up off the table so that's
sort of given a resurgence to the
interest in recovering geometry that's
out there and of course recovering
geometry is a fundamentally difficult
problem in computer vision you know
here's a picture you look at this
monocular Lee and you see a surface with
some geometry on there there's a certain
ambiguity perhaps as to what's in front
and what's behind but there's a question
of well how do you get a single image to
to understand this kind of stuff you of
course have all these problems that
intensity image intensity changes is a
function of the illumination but here's
an image of same scene lit from
different colored light and of course it
provides a different image to be
processed and yet the geometry is
identical we've talked about this before
challenges of scale here's an
interesting picture when you look at
this table you see a bunch of white
bowls cups etc whatever but if we
actually were to sort of take a look at
just in this patch right there clearly
there's not a
a lot of interesting variation going on
there for image processing the handle
and you know somehow basically has to be
able to somehow figure out from the
basic extraction of this shape that
there's this cylinder on the table and
that's generally a hard thing to do we
also have troubled that color is not all
that discriminative sometimes of what's
there so this sort of a similarity
between the foreground and the
background well we'd really like is we
like some represent a something that
gave us the shape directly and so that
we would see something that looks like
this and the other won't surprise you
that this is where we're headed so here
is a bunch of objects on a table and you
know it'd be nice if the system could
just know that this was one surface and
this was another surface and these are
the objects and what we're gonna do is
we're gonna talk about 3d sensing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
