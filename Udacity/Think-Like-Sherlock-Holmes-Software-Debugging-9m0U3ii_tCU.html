reasoning over here is a cause-effect
chain first dr. Watson ran across mad
therefore the servant had to claim the
shoe and therefore there were scratches
found in the shoe in debugging we also
have such a cause-effect chain from the
defect to the infection that is an error
in the state and finally to the failure
which can be observed by a user the
difference in the Sherlock Holmes story
however is that Sherlock makes just one
observation and deduces everything that
must have happened before whereas in
debugging so far we have assumed that we
can actually observe what has happened
before
anyway we assume that we have perfect
control over a program and therefore can
observe everything but what happens if
this information is not available if all
we know that the failure occurred but we
have no history or means to observe what
was going on this is where the Sherlock
Holmes method of debugging comes into
play for we must do like Sherlock Holmes
is to think backwards from our
observations to find out what has really
happened in debugging we start with a
failure and think backwards what could
be the possible cause such that we can
finally discover the reason</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
