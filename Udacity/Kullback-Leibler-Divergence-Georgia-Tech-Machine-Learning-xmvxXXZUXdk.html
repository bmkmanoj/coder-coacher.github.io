information theory we will also discuss
something called as the cool back
library divergence
it is also famously called as KL
divergence and you must have heard this
term in our previous lectures so it is
useful to realize that mutual
information it's also a particular case
of KL divergence so KL divergence
actually measures the difference between
any two distributions it is used as a
distance measure for this particular
lesson it is sufficient to understand
how KL divergence is used to measure the
distance between two distributions the
KL divergence is given by this
particular formula and it is always
non-negative and 0 only when P is equal
to Q when P is equal to Q the log of 1
is 0 and that's why the distance is 0
otherwise it is always some non-negative
quantity so it serves as a distance
measure but it is not completely a
distance measure because it doesn't
follow the triangle law but then you
should ask yourself why you need to know
KL divisions or where it is used usually
in usually in supervised learning we are
always trying to model our data to a
particular distribution so in that case
our district one of our distributions
can be a well known distribution and we
can denote that as P of X and then can
sample our dataset to find out Q of X
while doing that we can use scale
diversions as a substitute to the least
square formula that we used for fitting
so it's just a different way of trying
to fit your data to your existing model
and we'll come back to KL divergence in
some of our problem sets</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
