math together in this course a great
place to start would be by talking about
numbers since we'll use them all the
time
what is the number really well it's not
a thing out here in the world that we
can see and touch I at least have never
seen a 3 or a negative 15 and a half
walking around anywhere instead numbers
are abstract and we use them as tools to
talk about things that we find around us
a kindergarten teacher for example needs
to make sure that none of her students
get lost when she takes them on a trip
to the zoo one way she could do this
would be by constantly looking at a list
of their names and double-checking that
every child on the list is in the group
but this would get really tiring and
probably wouldn't be all that effective
what do you think might be a better way
of doing this our first quiz of the
course will be a really kind of silly
question but let's go with it how could
a teacher make sure that none of her
students get lost at the zoo and here
are a couple of answers that you get to
choose from tell them all to be
responsible for themselves and not run
off your second choice is hope for the
best your third choice is count them
your last choice is they probably
shouldn't go on the trip at all just to
be safe please click the circle next to
the choice below that you think is the
best answer when you've picked which one
you think is right press the submit
button underneath</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
