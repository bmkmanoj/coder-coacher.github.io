the write-back policy of the buffer
cache a sudden system crash or power
failure would mean that all the changes
made in memory only would be lost if the
storage device is removable it could
just be that the user unplugged it
before rejecting it would be a nice idea
if we could periodically copy all the
changes reflected in memory to the disk
maybe we could do this when some fixed
number of dirty blocks is reached the
trouble is that the dirty blocks will
likely be scattered all over the disk
and we would have to spend an inordinate
amount of seek time just putting the
right head of the disk in the correct
place indeed it's the seek time that
makes random access to a disk so slow in
general sequential access can be
thousands of times faster than random
access will be so much easier if we
could just write everything to one
contiguous block this is the idea behind
journaling file systems they reserve a
contiguous portion of the disk for this
express purpose we write the changes to
the journal quickly and mark the dirty
blocks in memory as clean then at a more
opportune time we apply all these
changes stored in the journal to the
appropriate files on the disk
the name journal comes in the analogy to
a diary that one might write in every
day to record the changes in one's life
in time sequential order here are we
recording the changes to the file system
of course this does complicate reading
from the disk somewhat anytime we read
from the disk we need to check the
journal to see if there are any changes
to apply total time spent on writing is
slower after all we are doing two writes
instead of just one the key is that the
write to the journal is faster and that
is the one we're doing at the critical
time when we found that we had too many
dirty pages or blocks in memory
journaling also has the advantage that
it helps with crashes problems typically
occur when a write to some important
data structure like an inode is
interrupted by some system crash or
power failure let's consider what
happens I'm going to write from the
journal so the rest of the disk is
interrupted first well in that case the
change that we need to apply will still
be in the journal and so we can just
reapply it on restart no problem the
other write to worry about is the write
to the journal itself a failed write to
the journal however can be detected by a
text
and then the change can simply be
ignored again leaving the important data
structure on disk in a consistent state</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
