for just another minute just to see how
means and sentences might try to work
for this problem and get into
difficulties so this is the goal state
painted lighter and painted ceiling and
this is the initial state now means its
analysis may enumerate the operators are
applicable to painted ladder in the
painted ceiling here the operator might
be paint ladder here the operator might
be paint ceiling but that requires some
precondition climb up ladder which is
not satisfied the initial state so mean
since analysis will pick the gold
painted lighter and select the operator
paint ladder which gets the mean since
analysis to this state this is a
heuristic method here is the paint
ladder specified a rewrite and you can
see the preconditions of paint ladder
match the initial state and the post
conditions match the successor state now
that means and son analysis has achieved
the first goal of painted lighter it may
turn to the second goal of painted
ceiling recall the de sousa current
state so means-ends analysis may pick
the operator crime lighter as a
precondition for the operator of painted
ceiling but note what happens the
precondition of crime writer conflicts
with the post condition of paint guider
this was not dry ladder this requires
dry ladder there is a conflict here in a
situation like this now the robot would
need to just wait for the rider to
become dry again before crime redditors
applicable so it seems as as of the
people that I sometimes higher for
working on my home are using means-ends
analysis they first pin the ladder then
they go of wait until the ladder dries
up and then the experts expect me to pay
them for their time to summarize we have
a plan for achieving one of the goals
painted ladder but this particular plan
crabbers achieving the other goal
painted ceiling because it creates a
condition that makes it impossible to
achieve the other goal so the question
now becomes how main intelligent agent
actually reason about the conflicts
between these goals how can planning
systematically find out how to organize
these various operators so that this
conflicts do not occur what we have
described here this goal clobbering is
true for all simple planners sometimes
called linear planners linear planner
dozen
not try to reason about the conflict
between these goals does not create a
reason about how the plan for one goal
make Robert another goal instead it just
goes about making plans as if this goes
can be achieved in any order</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
