string just so that the whole function
would fit on the page in general I
should bring that back the doc string is
important part of the solution but
here's what I do the heart of the
function is just a call to shortest path
search start at the start state we have
a successor function and a goal function
the goal function just asked is the goal
number that integer that we're trying to
achieve anywhere in the state is any one
of the current levels of the glasses
equal to the goal and here's a successor
function and I'm going to build up this
dictionary of results which I call succ
for a successor it's a dictionary of
state action pairs and I go through all
the indices that's equivalent to the
glass numbers 0 1 2 3 i've invented this
function called replace and replace
takes a tuple and index into the tuple
and a value that we want that index to
be now why did I need that because
tuples are immutable so mostly this is
saying replace states uh by with
capacities of I but I can't say that for
a tuple so I needed a function that's
going to do it for me so take that tuple
with the states of I replaced by the
capacity that's the same as the action
of filling and I replace it with 0
that's the ancient action of emptying
now the action of pouring which we have
over here is a little bit more
complicated so we have to go through all
the glasses twice pouring from I into J
we have to make sure that we're not
pouring into yourself and then the
amount that we pour is the minimum of
how much we have we can't pour more than
we have in the glass that we're pouring
and we also can't pour more than would
fill up the glass that we're pouring
into so that's the amount we're going to
transfer and then we subtract that
amount from the glass we're pouring from
and we add that amount from the glass
we're pouring into and we make that a
pouring action then we just return the
result then there's one little statement
here that says if you didn't specify the
start state make that be the tuple that
contains all zeros and whose length is
the same as the number of glasses we
have so that's the whole solution except
here's my reply
function so replace in general takes any
sequence but it's really most applicable
for tuples that are immutable makes that
sequence into a list mutates it because
we are allowed to mutate lists and then
puts it back together again and so what
am I doing here this might look a little
bit unusual but what I'm doing is I'm
saying tell me the type of the original
sequence a tuple could be a string could
be a list and then call that because
types are functions so in this case is
going to be tuple and then call tuple on
this list s and make s back into a tuple
and I made a general like this so that
it would also apply to lists and strings
and finally here's the test cases and if
we run them it turns out it works</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
