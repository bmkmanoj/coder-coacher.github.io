way to reuse classes to build new
classes so what you wanted to do was to
find these two new types main-dish and
appetizer and both of these are types of
dishes that means if we had a dish type
well we could create the main dish type
by specializing the dish type and we
could create an appetizer type by also
specialize in the dish type this is
called inheritance we would say main
dish inherits from dish there's lots of
terminology that goes along with this we
would say the main dish inherits from
dish and that's what these up arrows in
our diagrams mean if we look at it in
the other direction we would say
main-dish and appetizer are both
subclasses of dish and we would say dish
is the base class or superclass of
main-dish and appetizer there's a lot of
different terminology people used to
talk about this but the important thing
to understand is that we're building
these subclasses main-dish and appetizer
which are special types of dishes by
starting from the dish type and adding
some extra behavior to it we can keep
going we could have a new derived class
based on the appetizer class and then
the pythonic appetizer would inherit
from appetizer
it would also inherit from dish and
these sub class terms are transitive so
pythonic appetizer is a subclass of
appetizer it's also a subclass of dish
how does this look in code well if you
remember when we introduced the class
syntax we said there was this base class
as part of the class definition so far
we've used object for all of our base
classes but the base class can be any
other type so to get what we've shown
here we would have the main dish have as
its base class the dish and then the
definition of the main dish class and we
would have the appetizer have as its
base class the dish and the pythonic
appetizer has as its base class the
appetizer what about the dish well we
didn't draw any base class for that and
it's base classes object that's the
ultimate superclass of all classes we
created in Python</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
