from zero to the length over 2 minus 1
that minus 1 is always a little
inelegant I prefer to use the less than
sign here inside the loop we were
supposed to swap the position I and I
plus length over 2 let's copy and paste
the swap code here it is but not J of
course is supposed to be this now I
fixed up the code and are ready to run
here you see the result the array before
and after swapping and you can see that
these numbers are now where they're
supposed to be as well as for the other
half I want to briefly talk about the
code that produced this print out here
when you look over here we call system
dot print on and we can't directly print
elements as I said arrays are more
primitive than array lists and an array
will not print out its value this method
here takes an array and turns it into a
string that lists all of the values
inside so when you point to print out an
ArrayList you can directly pass it on to
system out print on when you have an
array you have to use this helper method
of course you could also use a direct
loop but the helper method is more
convenient now remember what the point
of all of this was the point was not how
to implement the swapping algorithm in
Java the exciting thing was how we
discovered it in the first place we
discovered it by playing around with
stuff and not by worrying about exactly
how the index values were or whether we
needed a for loop or a while loop and I
hope that's the lesson that stays with
you if you need to do something that's
off the beaten track that's different
from what you've seen before get out
some Lego bricks some coins some candies
whatever and figure out what the
operation would be with those and that
will give you the intuition that you
need in order to be successful
programmer programming is all about
having the right ideas at the right
intuition not about pushing the symbols
of the programming language around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
