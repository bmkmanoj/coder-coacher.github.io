I was talking about that pulls out the
shape you can then do further things
okay
here's a list of them boundary region
extracting connect components convex
hull thinning skeletons pruning I'm just
gonna talk about two and I'm really
gonna just talk about one in detail
not even detail one slides worth and
then thinning I'll just mention okay so
sometimes you'd like to extract the
boundary well actually that's very easy
to do what I can do is I can take an
object if a plus B is the dilation a
minus B is the erosion I can get the
boundary by just taking the object and
subtracting out the eroded version of it
here they talk about B being a three by
three square it could be whatever sized
square I'm going to take the binary
pixels and I'm gonna remove any of the
ones that survived the erosion process
alright so you want to do that and voila
this is what you get and you realize
what's happening here of course is
here's our original binary image and
when I erode the you know that the
contour moves in by a certain amount and
if it's three by three by at least one
and a hat two pixels so what that'll do
is if I subtract what's inside the red
from the whole thing I end up with just
this boundary so it's just a trivial
operation right I take the image I wrote
it and then subtract those pixels and I
subtract I mean remove those pixels from
the original and that's how you do
boundaries there's another operation
called thinning you'll notice this
operator here this is this hit-or-miss
operator what matters is you take your
original picture and you've got these
different structuring elements and
essentially you keep eating away at your
picture using that structuring the
structuring elements and you would go
from this filled in picture like this
you would end up with with something
that's just like this or it's a one
pixel wide thin band all right when you
keep doing the thinning and that can be
used for finding skeletons there used to
be a lot of thought about using
skeletons variety of shape
representations when we were doing
models and people still use it and
that's why I mention it but I'm not
gonna talk anymore about it it's just
thinning and thickening and in fact the
thickening is just the inverse of
that so here you have this original
thing and then you're growing it out to
get out towards the boundary of some
sort again I'm not going to worry too
much about the details</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
