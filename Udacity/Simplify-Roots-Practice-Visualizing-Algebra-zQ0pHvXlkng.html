you got those correct this cube root and
this fifth root might have been tricky
so if you struggled with them that's
okay for the first one we split 32 into
2 times 16 the square root of 16 equals
4 and the square root of x squared is x
and the square root of Y squared is y
this leaves us with a 2 in the radical
which gives us our final result for the
second one we want to split up 75 into
three times 25 the square root of 25
equals 5 and then we leave the three
inside of the square root since it's not
a perfect square next we use our idea of
power divided by root we have a square
root so we want to take this power and
divide it by 2 3 divided by 2 equals one
with a remainder of 1 so 1 a will be on
the outside and 1a will be on the inside
4b will have 8 divided by two which is
four so B to the fourth and finally 4c
will have C squared since C to the
fourth divided by 2 equals C squared
this is our final result for the next
problem we rewrite 8 as 2 cubed we know
the cube root of 2 cubed is just too
since this factor appears three times
now we use power / route to simplify
each of these variables 5/3 is one
remainder to foresee 4/3 equals one
remainder 1 and 4 D we have 6 divided by
3 which equals d squared and no DS
inside the radical since the remainder
is 0 and finally for our last one we
can't take the fifth root of thirty-six
since we don't have a factor that
appears five times nothing simplifies
but for variable factors we can simplify
10 / 5 equals 2 so well w squared with
no w's inside of a radical since the
remainder is 0 for x we'll have 6
divided by 5 which equals 1 remainder 1
and 4 y will have 12 / 5 which equals 2
remainder 2 here's our final answer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
