Nino let me start the lesson by defining
what a software architecture is and to
do that I'm going to use two seminal
definitions the first one is from Duane
Perry and Alex Wolfe and they define a
software architecture as elements form
and rationale in this definition the
elements are the what which means the
processes data and connectors that
compose a software architecture the form
is the how the set of properties of and
relationships among these elements and
finally the rational is the why the
justification for the elements and their
relationships the second definition I
want to use is from Mary Shaw and David
Garlin and they define a software
architecture as the level of design that
involves four main things a description
of elements from which the systems are
built the interactions among those
elements the patterns that guide their
composition and finally the constraints
on these patterns as you can see this
definition are fairly similar and there
are many more alternative definitions of
software architecture in fact if we try
to search the term software architecture
we get over 2 million entries and if we
look at the images in the results of
this search this is what we get and like
this sort of graphical depiction because
it gives you a clear idea that software
architecture are prevalent concept given
the number of results but they also show
you clearly the software architecture
are complex and it is if you look at
some of these pictures and ultimately
they show that software architecture are
presented in all kinds of ways including
in 3d if you look at this picture we
cannot clearly cover all of these
definitions in one lesson so what I will
do instead is to introduce a very
general definition that encompasses most
of the existing ones</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
