with the maternal and paternal lines but
we can go even further back with a cool
feature that allows us to look at how
much the anatole ancestry we have I'm
sorry I are you saying that humans and
Neanderthals were interbreeding at some
point well DNA from Neanderthal fossils
is indicating just that it seems like it
did happen and so why don't we go and
take a look and see how much nano
science history you have Matt let's do
it so here we are looking at the Y
chromosome paternal okay how do I get to
my neanderthal so back to my results and
then you should have a yeah in tortola
in session that's it yeah and oh wow so
it says I'm estimated two-point-seven
percent of my DNA is from the inner
tall's that's right it which is pretty
cool and we do that by comparing your
DNA to what's known for Nana to what the
DNA that's been obtained from Nana tall
fossils and so that means if you have
DNA from Neanderthals that means you've
only been able to get that DNA because
Neanderthals aren't alive anymore that's
right the only way to get that is from
fossils then absolutely and so and it's
been exciting to get more and more DNA
out of the innocent Neanderthal fossils
at first it was only possible to get
mitochondrial DNA and the mitochondrial
DNA didn't show that living humans have
any sharing of mitochondrial DNA with
Neanderthals and so we would everyone
was kind of concluding that there was no
into breeding but now when we look at
the rest of the chromosomes 12 22 we
start seeing evidence of the inter
breeding wow that's really cool and it
looks down here that I can actually see
where all of my friends and family act
with neandertal accessory I'm the
average but it looks like I can be
higher like three and one percent yeah
and your dad has a little more than you
yeah let's see yeah my dad's like in
three percent I mean these are um you
know just rough approximations because
it's hard to get an exact estimate so
but let me tell you one important thing
well as soon as I saw that most of your
DNA traces to Europe I
could have guessed roughly your
Neanderthals ancestry because Europeans
typically have between two and four
percent of their ancestry traced into
Nana trolls whereas people who most of
their ancestry traces to Africa have far
less because Nana tolls were not into
breeding with with our ancestors in in
Africa well and we can even see that
here here i am at 2.75 and roy king and
his father who have an american ancestry
one-point-two percent and 1.5% we fought
for so yes so so that makes a lot of
sense on knowing what we do about the
timing and the location of where this
interbreeding took place very cool mmm
great</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
