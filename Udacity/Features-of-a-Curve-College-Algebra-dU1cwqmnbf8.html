volume of a box versus the length of a
cut that we put in it to be able to fold
the sides up and clearly the one that we
have here is the restricted domain
version one that Athena wanted because
of the real-life situation that she was
using this in conjunction with however
let's take a second to look at the
equation for this function it a of X is
equal to seven minus 2x times 5 minus 2x
times X and you'll remember earlier on I
multiplied all this out and when we do
all this multiplication out we get a
different form for express in this
function for X cubed minus 24x squared +
+ 35 X now the reason that I wanted to
do the multiplication aren't right now
so I think you might notice this
equation is pretty different from
anything else that we've graphed so far
in the course in particular we have an
exponent of 3 in our function what on
earth is a graph that has a third degree
term and it look like well why don't we
get rid of these domain restrictions
briefly and zoom out and look at the
entire graph that this is part of so
here's the full version of our function
without any domain restrictions multiply
it out the function itself is 4x cubed
minus 24x squared plus 35 X this is a
totally different equation that anything
we've dealt with before it graphically
at least though we did see expressions
that look like this early on in the
course because this function has a
different degree than other functions
we've dealt with it's going to have
different graphical properties as well
now I've labeled a few different special
points on the graph or points that may
potentially be special and I'd like you
to help identify what they are so in
each of the purple boxes over here to
complete the statements I'd like you to
fill in letters that go with these
different points and this is blue one
right here this I'd like to be a number
that you just type in so basically I'm
asking you which points by the X
intercepts and how many are there where
the function changes from increasing to
decreasing and when it changes from
decreasing to increasing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
