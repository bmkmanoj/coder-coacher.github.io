because we have tens of thousands of
servers on a flat layer to topology
where all of the servers have a topology
independent Mac or hardware address and
thus in the default case every switch in
the topology has to store a forwarding
table entry for every single MAC address
one solution is to introduce what are
called pods and assign pseudo MAC
addresses to each server corresponding
to the pod in which they're located in
the topology so in addition to having a
real mac address each server has what's
known as a pseudo MAC address as shown
in pink thus switches in the data center
topology no longer need to maintain
forwarding table entries for every host
they only need to maintain entries for
reaching other pods in the topology once
a frame enters a pod the switch then of
course has entries for all of the
servers inside that pod but they don't
need to maintain entries for the MAC
addresses for servers outside of each
pod for example the switch in pod one
only needs to maintain entries for these
two servers with mac addresses a and B
but it doesn't need to maintain
independent entries for the servers with
mac addresses C and D it only needs to
maintain an entry for how to reach pod
two likewise for pods to and pods three
now in such a data center topology of
course these hosts are unmodified so
they're still going to respond to things
like ARP queries with their real mac
addresses so we need a way of dealing
with that as well as a way of mapping
pseudo MAC addresses to real mac
addresses the solution is as follows
when a host such as server a issues in
our query that query is intercepted by
the switch but instead of flooding that
query the switch intercepts the query
and forwards it to
entity called the fabric manager the
fabric manager then responds with the
pseudo Mac corresponding to that IP
address host a then sends the frame with
the destination pseudo MAC address and
switches in the topology can forward
that frame to the appropriate pod
corresponding to the pseudo MAC address
of the destination server once the frame
reaches the destination pod let's say in
this case pod 3 the switch at the top of
that pod can then map the pseudo MAC
address back to the real mac address and
the server that receives the frame
receives an Ethernet frame with its real
destination MAC address so it knows that
the ethernet frame was intended for it
by intercepting art queries in this way
and providing a mapping between
topological pseudo MAC addresses and
real physical MAC addresses we can
achieve hierarchical forwarding in a
large layer 2 topology without having to
modify any host software</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
