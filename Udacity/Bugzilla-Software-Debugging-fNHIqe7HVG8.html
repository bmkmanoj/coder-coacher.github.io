real people who enter and classify
problem reports let's take a look at a
real problem database to get an idea
what this looks like
fortunately for for many open source
projects there's problem databases which
are readily available for instance let
us take a look at Bugzilla
the bug database for all Mozilla
products in particular the Firefox
browser this problem database contains
more than 700,000 problems of course
most of them have been fixed at this
point let's assume I have a problem with
a blinking cursor I enter the search
terms for the bug click on quick search
and here I see all the issues that occur
currently or at least that have been
reported by users with respect to the
text cursor and blinking for instance
here we have blinking caret does not
move when space is entered and we can
get details on this bug this is the
original bug report filed 10 years ago
let's go for a more recent one
here's ad key bindings to CSS value
adjustment you see the bug report you
see the product is it applies to in this
case Firefox you see when it was
reported here's the original bug report
and now you see the developers talking
about the problem and you can also
follow back the history as developers
suggest patches for the bug and in the
end discuss possible alternatives on how
to address that bug</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
