values of s and T so this is quite
convenient and the important reason for
that is both of the values on the right
side get evaluated first to get turned
into their values before we do any of
the assignments so what's going on s
refers to some value let's call that
alpha and T refers to some value we'll
call that beta this is before the
assignments to evaluate the multiple
assignment expression well we find the
value of T here that has the value of
beta and we find the value of s and s
has the value of alpha so we've
evaluated both of these and we've turned
them into the values the names refer to
and now we do the assignments so now s
will be changed to refer to the first
value which is the beta and T will be
changed to refer to the second value so
this has very different behavior than if
we did two assignments like this so if
he tried instead doing assign T to s and
then assign s to T well that wouldn't
swap the values because by the time we
do the second assignment the value of s
has changed now it refers to whatever
the value of T was if we had done these
two statements well both of them would
end up having the value beta</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
