throw a ball with an initial velocity of
50 meters per second but this time I
don't say vo xrv oh why because this is
not purely horizontal or purely vertical
it's at an angle now we know if we can
break this problem into two
one-dimensional motion problems we're
all set so that should be our end goal
let's pause for a second not literally
don't hit the pause button but let's
think back to when we first started
talking about horizontal and vertical
velocity remember we talked about a ball
with vertical and horizontal velocity
components well these components were
just a way of thinking about the true
velocity which was off at some angle in
that case we went from components to the
true velocity now we're going to go the
other way so what do I mean by that I
mean we're going to make a right
triangle and how do we do it well here's
our angled side here's our hypotenuse
and now I've broken this hypotenuse down
into what I call components a horizontal
and a vertical initial velocity
component now if I call this angle alpha
and I tell you that alpha is equal to
about 53 degrees can you tell me what V
0 y equals you might have to think back
to the trigonometry from unit one entry
answer here and round to the nearest
whole number</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
