not going to surprise you we're gonna
use principle component analysis because
when you see a picture that looks like
this where I want the extended dimension
I want to use that extended variance so
here's how we're gonna do principal
component analysis for this assume we
have M data points ok so x1 through XM
all right where there in some D
dimensional space are to the D where D
is big really big at least 10,000 maybe
it's a million ok so if I had a one that
1k by 1k image that'd be a million
pixels right so I have a million
dimensional space so what we want is
some direction in that big space that
captures most of the variation ok and
furthermore and this is sort of
important not sort of important this is
really important if I talk about a
direction and let's suppose U is my
direction how would I find out where it
lies along that well what's nice about
this is because we're doing everything
linearly we're just gonna take the dot
product of X minus its mean why are we
subtracting the mean cuz none of this
stuff works if you don't subtract the
mean remember we're doing variation
about the mean so we subtract the mean
and we take the dot product and then you
X of U of X I that would be the
coefficient so we want to find the U
that captures most of the variance all
right well you know already how to do
this because we've been talking about it
right so here's the same expression that
we had before but I've sort of used the
notation we've just developed right we
have we're gonna say the variance along
U well we want it over all the possible
points so what we say is ok well we're
just gonna take that average here is X
minus mu dotted with u we multiply it
also by its transpose so that we get the
square value ok so that's just the same
thing that we had from the previous
slide I'm just gonna rearrange that a
little bit right so I can pull the use
out here and the other you out there
because it's transpose transpose and
what I have left here in the middle well
what is that
right that's just the covariance matrix
and we'll call it the covariance matrix
Sigma and we've talked about how for
finding this the axis of maximum
variance we need that covariance matrix
but think about this just a little bit
more so that variance of U is U
transpose Sigma u all right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
