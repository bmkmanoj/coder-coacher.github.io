ranking function so we said we're going
to have a time step we're going to keep
going through steps to get more accurate
rankings but initially we're going to
give every Rank 1 divided by the number
of pages before I call that capital n
I'm going to use n pages as a more
pythonic variable name for that and we
updated the rank at time step T by
adding the probability that the random
surfer starts over and randomly picks
that page so that's 1 minus D is the
probability of starting over divided by
n pages how many pages there are and
remember that D is our damping constant
and we'll decide that D is pointing
that's the damping constant we add to
that the sum that we get of all the
ranks all the pages that link to this
URL we add up D times the previous
iteration so it's going to be D times
rank on step t minus 1 of that page but
we want to divide that by the number of
out links from P so starting to look
more like Python code we want to
simplify it a little bit before we get
to Python code and the first thing we're
going to do is simplify it is observe
that well we have this t parameter but
we only ever use the very previous one
so we don't really need to keep track of
the rank value for all the different T
values we just need to keep track of the
previous one when we did Fibonacci we
kept track of current and next and
variables and that allowed us keep track
of the previous and the previous
previous Fibonacci numbers what we want
to do with ranks is something similar so
we're going to use the variable ranks to
keep track of the current ranks and as
we compute the new ranks we're going to
use the variable new ranks so we'll use
ranks this corresponds to the ranks at
time t minus 1 the ranks of the previous
iteration and we'll have a variable new
ranks which is the ranks at time T and
the reason we need both of those as we
update the rank from each page so we're
going to go through the pages
recomputing its rank we can't lose the
previous one we still need to get rank
at the previous
step four that page if we use the one
that we got this time that would distort
the results it would mean that the order
that we update the ranks for changes the
results so we don't want the results to
depend on the order that we go through
the pages that's why we need to keep
track of both the previous values which
will be used for ranks two minus one and
the new ranks once we've done that we
don't need the T parameter anymore
what we're going to do is change this
rank the rank at time T is going to be
the value of new rank and the value of
rank at time t minus one that's the
value of ranks the other change I
slipped into this before we had parens
here and I've changed them to square
brackets and square brackets should give
you the idea that well this might be a
data structure that we're indexing and
that's correct we want to index the data
structure and we want to index it by the
URL that we're looking for and the
Python dictionary provides a great way
to do that at the end of this will be a
Python dictionary and that's exactly
what we want so I think we're ready to
start looking at the code we've written
this formula it's still a mix of math
and Python but we're going to turn this
into the code for computing the page
ranks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
