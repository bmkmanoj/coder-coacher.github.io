they're more properly classified as
frameworks and frameworks have this
important concept of inversion of
control when you're using libraries
you've got your code that is doing most
of the work however you have a couple of
places where you're going to need some
help so you plug in a couple different
libraries your codes running along you
call in to one of the libraries for help
with something specific like drawing or
playing a sound and then your code
resumes control and keeps doing what
it's doing on the other hand when you're
using a framework the framework is doing
most of the work and that has one
particular place where you insert your
code so the framework is going along
allocating resources determining when
things get called and then eventually
when it's time for your application
specific logic the framework calls into
your code to do something and then your
code returns control back to the
framework this is called inversion of
control or more colloquially the
Hollywood principle fantastic audition
kid your real talent you're gonna be a
star so I'll call you when we got our
all no no you don't call us we call you
for instance the game engine handle
stuff like starting up the app setting
up a place to draw allocating various
resources and then only when it's
finally time to draw a frame of the game
then it calls your code to provide the
game specific logic needed to draw that
frame when you're done drawing you
return control back to the framework</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
