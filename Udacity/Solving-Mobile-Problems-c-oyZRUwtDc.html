got my database working and I just
posted my first picture awesome can I
see whoa that looks pretty cool yeah I'm
super excited but most of my friends are
using their phones to view my web app
and so I was thinking maybe I want to
make a project compass mobile app well
it sounds like your next step is to get
into mobile programming by 2020 there
will be over 6.1 billion smartphone
users the majority of the world will
have access to the web through their
mobile phone that means there's a huge
demand for mobile programmers
specifically iOS programmers and Android
programmers what's different about
mobile programmers is that they work
closely with the actual hardware of
mobile phones many mobile apps like
snapchat use hardware features such as
mobile cameras let's take a look at what
types of problems and projects mobile
programmers work on mobile developers
work on projects such as building apps
that are responsive on different devices
creating apps with a clean user
interface so that it's intuitive and
easy-to-use syncing apps to servers so
that you can present data to a user
taking apps from a functional state to a
production-ready state through handling
error cases accessibility features
localization widgets and libraries
building high-performance apps by taking
advantage of mobile device hardware such
as cameras and microphones the medium
app is a great example of a
well-designed mobile app it's responsive
to different screen sizes and there's a
clean user interface it also seems with
different servers to get data from web
sites like Twitter and other news
services it also takes advantage of
mobile device hardware such as the
camera so that users can take pictures
and post them to their medium blog as of
July 2015 there are over three million
mobile apps whether you decide to build
an iOS app or an Android app mobile
applications create a multi-billion
dollar industry let's chat with Sidney
about her experiences
as an iOS developer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
