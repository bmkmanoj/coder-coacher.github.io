necessarily optimal I think he put
handle is fixed at this particular place
in the explanation because the first
reason here he wanted to capture the
notion that only fixed hundred cups
enable drinking and that this part does
it he wanted to capture the notion that
only fixed handle cups enable drinking
and this certainly does that however
this is not an optimal way of fixing
this particular explanation however this
is not the best way of fixing this
particular explanation because it leads
to additional decisions it suggests that
only those things which have a fixed
handles a liftable but of course from
the pail we know that the pill does not
have a fixed handle and get a pail
acceptable this suggests that handle is
fixed should go somewhere else perhaps
above object is liftable but still below
object enables drinking the agent to can
figure out that this is not the optimal
place for putting handle is fixed
because a it voided its notion of a pail
a pail is liftable but has a movable
handle it also avoided this notion of a
briefcase this part was coming from as
president of a briefcase the briefcase
of the movable handle and it too is
liftable this is how the agent knows
this handle is fixture go somewhere else
in this explanation above object is
liftable but beneath object is enables
drinking</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
