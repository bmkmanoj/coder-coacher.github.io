proteins like collagen to remain strong
and resistant to fractures
now mutations that affect the way
collagen coils into a triple helix can
affect the strength and integrity of
bones in such a way that causes
osteogenesis imperfecta or brittle bone
disease the gene that codes for the
alpha one component of type one collagen
is call one a one and it's essential for
building the collagen fibers like you
see here normally in the form of a
triple helix if you follow the colors
closely you can see the red spiraling
around the structure and the green and
the blue doing the same thing the call
when a one-gene can be found on
chromosome 17 in the human genome
chromosome 17 is about 81 million base
pairs long and the call winning one gene
can be found about halfway down the call
one a one gene spans 51 exons and over
18,000 base pairs of DNA after
transcription and splicing the mRNA has
4,000 395 nucleotides of coding region
between the start and stop codons and
after translation we get a protein with
1464 amino acids remember we just
divided 4,000 395 by 3 and subtracted
one because this last codon doesn't code
for an amino acid the stop codon is just
empty now most of the amino acids in the
collagen molecule itself are glycine
because this is actually what allows the
collagen to form that beautiful triple
helix we saw that sort of turning back
on itself a lot of glycines make that
possible so any allele that might
disrupt the glycines in these positions
are associated many times with
osteogenesis imperfecta but one mutation
of the col1a1 gene contains AG 2 t a
guanine thymine mutation at position
1245 of the coding region now using the
genetic code which we learned about in
lesson 3 and that you can find any
instructors notes on this page I want
you to determine the expected amino acid
change from the top to the bottom
sequence and then select the type of
mutation that best categorizes this
change
to the T allele if you have any trouble
answering this you might want to go back
and review mutations from lesson six</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
