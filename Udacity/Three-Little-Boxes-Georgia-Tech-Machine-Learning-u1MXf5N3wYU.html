other than the fact that it's an
algorithm with symbols that it sort of
works at least informally and then I'm
gonna do what I always do and refer you
to actually read the the text to get the
the details but before I do that I
wanted to go through an example if you
think that would help
I would like an example okay so let's go
through an example so here's a very
simple example so I've got three little
boxes on the screen can you see them
yeah now they're the same boxes I've
drawn them up here beforehand because
I'm going to solve this problem in only
three steps
hey those boxes are really nice did you
get help from our trusty course
developer I did in fact get help from
our trusty of course developer and when
I say help I mean he did this oh thanks
push car yes push car wonderful now
what's really cool about this is that
push cars already lets you know that
we're going to be able to do this in
three simple steps and I'm gonna be able
to animate it or at least hopefully
it'll look animated by the time we're
done with all of the editing so just pay
attention to the first box for now you
have a bunch of data points red pluses
and green minuses which is the opposite
of what we usually do push car but
anyway it's red pluses and green minuses
with the appropriate labels and they all
live in this this part of the plane by
the way what do you call a part of a
plane I know you have line segments
what's like a sub part of a plane looks
like a square to me yes it is but I mean
what do you call them you don't call it
a plane segment do you what do you call
it a region a square region fine so it's
a square region on a plane and we want
to figure out how to be able to
correctly classify these examples okay
so that's nothing new there we just want
to go to come up with something so now
we have to do what we did in the quiz is
we have to specify what our hypothesis
space is so here's our hypothesis space
so the hypothesis space is the set of
axis aligned semi planes you know what
that means no well for the purpose of
this example it means I'm gonna draw a
line either horizontal or vertical and
say that everything on one side of that
line is positive and everything on the
other side of that line is negative I
see okay good right and there acts as a
line because it's only horizontal and
and their semi planes because the
positive part of it isn't only in part
of the plane okay so I'm gonna just walk
through what boosting would end up doing
with this particular example or what a
boosting might do with this particular
example given that you have a learner
that always chooses between axis aligned
semi planes okay yeah so let's imagine
we ran our boosting algorithm now in the
beginning it step one all of the
examples look the same right because we
have no particular reason to say any are
more important than the other any are
easier or harder than the other and
that's just the algorithm that we have
before we run through and we ask our
learner to return some hypothesis that
does well in classifying the examples it
turns out that though there are many and
in fact there's an infinite number of
possible hypotheses you could return one
that works really well is one that looks
like a vertical line that separates the
first two data points from the rest that
was what I was guessing of course it was
and what I'm saying here is that
everything to the left of this line is
going to be positive and everything the
right is going to be negative so if you
look at this what does this hypothesis
do so it gets correct correctly labeled
positive the two pluses to the left
right correct and it gets correct all of
the minuses as well correct right but it
gets wrong the three pluses on the right
side so it kids this wrong this wrong in
this room right there three plus catears
exactly so the three plus catears that's
actually pretty good so I'm just I'm
just gonna ask you to trust me here but
it turns out that the specific error
here is 0.3 and if you stick that into
our little alpha you end our little our
little formula for alpha you end up with
alpha equal to 0.4 - that's not obvious
to me but is it C okay good so there you
go and that's just what happens when you
stick this particular set in there so
now we're going to construct the next
distribution right and what's going to
happen in the next distribution so the
ones that
got right should get less sweet and the
ones that it got wrong should get more
wait so those the three plus catears
should become more prominent somehow
that's exactly what happens they become
I'm just gonna draw them as much thicker
and bigger to kind of emphasize that
they're getting bigger and it's going to
turn out that everything else is going
to get smaller which is a lot harder to
draw here so I'm just going to kind of
leave them their size so they sort of
get normalized away okay have a guess as
to what the next plane should be I think
that we should cut it underneath those
pluses but above the green minuses and
that should get us three errors the two
pluses on the left and the minus on the
top will be wrong but they have less
weight than the three pluses we got
right so this is going to be better than
the previous one so that's possibly true
but it's not what the learner output oh
let me tell you what the learner did
output though this learner output by
putting a line to the right of the three
pluses because it's got to get those
right and saying that everything to the
left is in fact positive so does that
seem like a reasonable one to you well
it says better than a half I guess
that's really all we're trying to do but
it does seem to do worse than what I
suggested well let's see it gets the
three that mattered that you were really
really doing poorly right but then so
did yours and it only it picks up still
the other two which it was getting right
and it gets wrong these three minuses
with aren't which aren't worth so much
so is that worse than what you suggested
now it gets wrong oh the three minuses
oh it gets correct those two red pluses
on the left so it's three things wrong
so that's just as good as what I
suggested okay I agree okay good so the
area this step by the way turns out to
be 0.2 one and the Alpha at this time
step turns out to be 0.65 so that's
pretty interesting so we've got a bunch
of a bunch of these right and a bunch of
these wrong what's going to happen to
the distribution over these examples
alright the ones that again the ones
that it got wrong should get pushed up
in weight and which ones are those is
the the three green minuses in them
pache right they should become more
prominent the pluses the three the three
plus catears should become less
prominent than they were but it still
might be more prominent than they were
in the beginning it might be because in
fact the Alpha let's see the Alpha is
bigger so it will have actually a bigger
effect on bringing it down yeah I guess
so but it'll still be more prominent
than the other ones that haven't been
bumped yeah the ones that even the two
the two red pluses on the Left have
you've never gotten them wrong so
they're really going to disappear
so if we do if I do my best to if I do
my best to kind of draw that you're
still you're gonna have these pluses are
going to be a little bit bigger than the
other pluses but they're going to be
smaller than they were before the two
the three greens in the middle are going
to be bigger than they were before but
those two pluses are going to be even
smaller and these two minuses are going
to be smaller so what do you think the
third hypothesis should be quiz I like
that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
