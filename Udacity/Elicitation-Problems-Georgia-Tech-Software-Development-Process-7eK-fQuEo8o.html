from these sources is not a
straightforward task as there are many
issues involved with the requirements
elicitation one first problem is the
thin spread of domain knowledge
knowledge is rarely available in an
explicit form that is it is almost never
written down
moreover knowledge is often distributed
across many sources for example in the
graphical depiction here to find out
that this is the purpose of the project
the developer the analyst needs to talk
to a lot of different people and to make
things even worse
there are often conflicts between the
knowledge gathered from different
sources a second issue is the fact that
the knowledge is often tacit what is
also called the say/do problem in the
example shown here for instance we have
a customer that is describing to any
analyst the way in which he accomplishes
a task so it performs these three steps
and reaches the goal whereas in practice
the actual way in which this task is
accomplished is by going through a
larger number of steps to get to the
same goal so the point here is that even
if the knowledge were more concentrated
so not as spread as in this example
people simply find it hard to describe
knowledge that they regularly use so it
is hard to make this knowledge explicit
to pass this knowledge to someone else
yet another problem is limited of server
ability identifier requirements through
observation is often difficult as the
problem owners might be too busy to
perform the tasks that we need to
observe or they might be doing a lot of
other things together with the tasks
that we need to observe that becomes
confusing that introduces noise moreover
even when this is not the case the
presence of an observer might change the
problem it is very typical for human
subjects to improve or modify an aspect
of their behavior
which has been experimentally measured
in response to the fact that they know
that they're being studied you know that
somebody is studying you and you change
the way in which you behave a typical
issue finally the information that we
collect might be biased for several
reasons people might not feel free to
tell you what you need to know or people
might not want to tell you what you need
to know for example in all the common
cases in which the outcome may affect
them people might provide you a
different picture from the real one in
order to influence you so they might
have a hidden agenda and mislead you
either consciously or unconsciously
so all these issues add to the
complexity of collecting
requirements over identifying the
purpose of a system</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
