first one is that the size of this huge
boolean formula here is polynomial in n
and i will show you why first of all how
large is each one of these formulas that
we're building well there's a constant
number of variables and as I show you
before if you want to ensure that for a
constant number of variables only
exactly one of them can be set to true
then the resulting formula is about the
square of the number of variables that
you have and since we have a constant
number of variables each formula here is
about the size of the square of that
constant so we have its kind of 0 of C
squared + C does not depend on the size
of the input so in a way we can even
write this as oh of one now we have a
polynomial number of these boolean
formulas so we have a polynomial of n
times a constant this is again a
polynomial of n so we're fine on this
side here we're also fine on this side
here because the formulas again are of
constant size it can be it can of course
be a huge size especially if you have a
system that can carry very large
variables but nevertheless it's a
constant size and that's all we care
about it does not depend on the size of
the input and we have a polynomial
number of them again here and finally
the code also has a constant number of
lines and so the boolean formula
reloading from that will also have
constant size so overall this huge
formula here has a size that is
polynomial in n does this formula have
only one satisfying assignment no it
doesn't it has a huge number of
satisfying assignments but each of those
satisfying assignments will ensure that
exactly one of the variables here is set
to true and so on and this gives us the
third property which means that this
satisfying assignment defines a snapshot
because it will tell you exactly what's
in this memory cell here and so on it
will tell you exactly what the program
is at and it would also tell you exactly
what's here in this memory and once we
have this you have actually
pleated the most difficult step of this
unit in my mind and we are now ready to
show that SAT is np-complete</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
