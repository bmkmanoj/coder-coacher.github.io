are there any smaller questions you'd
like to address all right Peter since
you phrase it so eloquently some
students have wondered or they've heard
acronyms like ll L R or Lal are bandied
about perhaps on the forums or mentioned
by other students who have taken similar
topics and you might wonder what do
those mean those acronyms are all
subsets of context-free languages or
context-free grammars their grammars
that are written in a special way to
make them easy to parse the parsing
approach that I've taught you in this
class where we build up the chart of
parsing states and memorize things can
handle any of them it handles ll it
handles lr handles lalr and in fact it
handles context-free grammars I think a
lot of those previous approaches lalr in
particular are really historical
accidents they were restricted classes
of grammars that engineers made back in
a time when computers were significantly
slower and we had to squeeze every drop
of blood from the turnip that we could
we had to squeeze every ounce of
performance that we could out of the
hardware available so we said oh it's
better if I a human spend a lot of time
refactoring my grammar to make it easy
for the parsing algorithm these days I
think your time the humans time is more
important than the computers I want to
be able to write down the grammar
naturally as a context-free grammar and
have it parsed so in this course we
don't focus on LLL our lalr those are
really historical accidents for
performance that aren't relevant anymore
in my opinion mmm we handle ll we handle
lr we handle lalr everything works well
in this class a related question is in
this class we covered a parsing approach
where we kept a chart of parsing states
and we memorized things some students
have wondered wes is that secretly
dynamic programming now some of you may
not have heard the term dynamic
programming before and it sounds really
exciting like something out of a
television commercial I'm dynamic and
I'm
programming how does that work out
actually it's an old term where program
means more like table or chart the way
to think of this is imagine you're going
to a parade or perhaps a symphony or a
concert or whatnot and there's a program
written that says you know 1pm will do
this and at 2pm will play this other
song and at 3pm will do that that's the
program for a concert to the program for
a schedule of events and that's the sort
of program that we're talking about in
dynamic programming just means a chart
dynamic there means that it's updated
over time so dynamic programming is then
a special keyword used in computer
science to mean I'm going to solve a
problem by taking a big chart and
writing down answers in it and adding to
this chart over time dynamic programming
is really useful when a problem exhibits
what's known as the optimal substructure
property that is when I can deal with
one problem by solving smaller problems
and then build the solution back up
interesting examples of this in the real
world are things like spell checkers
protein sequencers or even trying to
figure out the correct order in which to
do matrix-matrix multiplication comes up
a lot surprisingly it turns out yes
although I've been avoiding using the
words in class our memoization approach
to parsing really is an instance of
dynamic programming so you've learned
your first steps about dynamic
programming without it even being a big
deal and then finally in this grab bag
some students have wondered can we
compile an interpreted language or
interpret a compiled language what are
those even mean well we've talked quite
a bit about interpretation we interpret
HTML web pages and JavaScript on the fly
when we're running our web browser we
read in the input think about what it
means and spit out the answer
immediately in practice it's possible to
do some of that in advance to take your
source code and build an executable
program some binary code on disk that
you can ship it to someone else and when
they run it later it will produce the
same output but run really quickly so in
some sense it's like thinking very hard
about the problem optimizing it once and
for all and then shipping it to all of
your friends
compiling is a lot like packing really
well for a trip you could just make a
bunch of trips back and forth carrying
all your clothes or you could spend a
lot of time in your house beforehand
packing a suitcase very carefully
cramming it in there and then just make
one trip and the question or the
trade-off is well how far are you going
if you're going across the street it
might actually be faster just to grab
things and run back and forth across the
street if the program is quick or
whatnot conversely if you're going
across the country you probably want to
pack things very carefully first because
the round trip cost is expensive
compiled languages are very nice when
you know that the program is going to
take a while to run that you're going to
ship it to other people interpreted
languages like Python or Java Script are
really nice when you know it may only be
run once serve I one person looking at
the answer and that rapid prototyping a
rapid development is more important to
be able to try things out and have a lot
of flexibility can you interpret a
compiled language or compile an
interpreted language in fact the
distinction is really blurring all the
time even Python one of the languages we
use in this course nominally it's
interpreted you run things through a
Python interpreter gives you the answer
but actually if you've tried running
Python on your home computer you may
have noticed that it often creates a
bunch of dot pyc files that's compiled
python bytecode your Python interpreter
will take a look at your human readable
English text source code and if it has
if it has changed since last time
compile it down into Python bytecode and
then the byth up a bytecode can be run
quickly later so I like packing things
into a suitcase Java actually uses the
same approach Java source programs are
compiled down into Java bytecode which
is then interpreted by a Java Virtual
Machine later on and even language like
C classical compiled language we compile
it down into some machine code like x86
assembly or x86 machine code but that's
just interpreted by your processor cpu
later on so in some sense at the end of
the day everything is interpreted the
question is just how much of this
compilation we want to do beforehand and
again optimization techniques like just
in time translation or just-in-time
compilation you may have heard this
phrase JIT are starting to blur the
lines between the
as time goes by all of the techniques
that I'm teaching you lexing parsing
looking for errors optimization
interpreting environments all of these
are used in both compiled languages and
interpreted languages we'll get to all
of those throughout this course and then
you'll be well set to understand either
of those two paradigms</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
