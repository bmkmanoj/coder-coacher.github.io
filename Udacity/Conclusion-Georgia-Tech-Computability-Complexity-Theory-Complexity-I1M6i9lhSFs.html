problem satisfiability captures all the
complexity of the P versus NP problem an
efficient algorithm for satisfiability
when apply P equals NP if P is different
from NP then it can't be any efficient
algorithm for satisfiability
satisfiability has efficient algorithms
if and only if P equals NP Steve cook
professor at the University of Toronto
presented as theorem on May 4th 1971 at
the suppose iam on a theory computing at
that then Stouffer's in in Shaker
Heights Ohio but his paper didn't have
an immediate impact as a satisfiability
problem was mainly of interest to
logicians luckily a berkeley professor
richard carpel also took interest and
realized the new satisfiability is the
starting point if you can reduce
satisfiability to another NP problem
then our problem must be np-complete as
well Karp did exactly that in ear later
he published his famous paper we
disability among combinatorial problems
showing a 21 well known combinatorial
search problems were also np-complete
including the clique problem today tens
of thousands of problems have been shown
to be NP complete the ones that come up
the most often in practice tend to be
closely related to one of carps
originals in the next lesson we'll
examine some of the reductions that
prove these classic problems to be
np-complete and try to convey a general
sense for how to go about finding such
reductions this sort of argument might
come in handy if you need to convince
someone that a problem isn't as easy to
solve as they might think</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
