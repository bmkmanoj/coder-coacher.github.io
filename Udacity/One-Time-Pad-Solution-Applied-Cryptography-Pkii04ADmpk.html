is why the one-time pad provides perfect
secrecy is that for any given ciphertext
we can produce any message we want by
picking different keys that means that
if we just have the ciphertext we
haven't learned anything at all about
the message the way to produce the
message bs from this Slifer text well we
just need to change the first letter to
b1 below where C was so that means we
want to change this bit to be a zero
instead of a 1 in the output that means
we need to flip one bit in the key so
we'll need to change this key bit to be
a 1 instead of a 0 everything else will
be the same this will change the output
letter by by 1 so if we guess this key
instead of the correct key with yet what
looks like a fairly reasonable message
out but it would be 1 off from the one
that was there and in fact we can get
any possible message we want by guessing
different keys so this is what's called
a one-time pad and that notion of a
one-time pad goes back until at least
1882 it was discovered quite recently
that it was known about this early there
were one-time pads used in World War one
and used in many other what context
since then the notion of the one-time
pad being known this early was only
discovered last year by Stephen Delavan
what made a one-time pad really
interesting was an analysis that Claude
Shannon did Claude Shannon was the
father of information theory he did some
of the first theoretical work in
cryptography during World War two he
studied communication and he also
studied theory of secret systems and he
wrote this paper which was the first
paper that really understood in a
theoretical way what it means for a
cipher to be good and this paper was
written during World War 2 it was
classified and released in 1949 so what
we're gonna look at next is how you
formally reason about a cipher being
secure and why the one-time pad has all
the security properties that make it a
perfect cipher</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
