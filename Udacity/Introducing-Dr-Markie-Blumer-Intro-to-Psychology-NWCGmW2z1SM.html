to be my professor for human sexuality
when I was in my undergraduate and I was
also her teaching assistant for a
semester can you tell us a little bit
about your background I am a licensed
Marriage and Family Therapist I am also
a licensed mental health counselor I'm
an approved supervisor with the American
Association for marriage and family
therapy I began teaching about human
sexuality in 1998 as an assistant at the
Northern Arizona University starting in
the fall 2013 I will be an associate
professor at the University of Wisconsin
at the stout location and that will be
in the human development Family Studies
program and marriage and family therapy
program for the last four years I've
been an assistant professor at the
University of Nevada Las Vegas and my
PhD is in human development and family
studies with an emphasis in marriage and
family therapy from Iowa State
University so what are the stages of the
human sexual response yeah great
question actually that depends on whose
stages were talking about so Helen
Sanger Kaplan came up with a three phase
cycle of the human sexual response which
included a desire phase an arousal phase
and then ended with an orgasm phase
masters and Johnson's came up with a
four stage model so a little bit
different than Kaplan's model and
therefore stage model included an
excitement phase a plateau phase an
orgasm phase and a resolution phase so
really the biggest difference was the
resolution phase in other words they
thought there was something that
happened after Pete people reach a
plateau or a peak of excitement through
orgasm and that was kind of this
refractory period that people go through
where their bodies go back to more of a
normative state before arousal occurred
both of these models are great from a
Western point of view there's there's
nothing wrong with these models they
they match human physiology in a pretty
normative way what's problematic about
them however is not everybody is
situated to understand sexuality and
sexual response cycles from a Western
point of view in Eastern cultures there
are kind of different ways of
conceptualizing sexuality which would be
through more like tantric practices
which doesn't really have like this
rigid here are the phases of sexual
response cycle that you
must complete in order for it to be
successful so really those practices are
more like you might be aroused and then
you might kind of take a break and then
you might become aroused again and then
you might engage in sexual activity with
each other but rather than having an
orgasm be say the goal for one person it
might just be a goal for one of the
other people involved one person might
just take their time and the other
person might be orgasming multiple times
and maybe one partner never orgasms and
and that would be considered a great
sexual encounter so it really just
depends on where you are on the globe
like I said here in Western culture we
have kind of these two ways of thinking
about sex</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
