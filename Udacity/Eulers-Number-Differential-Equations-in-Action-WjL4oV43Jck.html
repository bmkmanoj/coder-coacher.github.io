to the power of x at x equals 0 is
slightly less than 1 and the slope of 3
to the power of x at x equals 0 is
slightly larger than 1 so it's not hard
to imagine that somewhere in between two
and three there is a number called e
Euler's number so that e to the power of
X has a slope of exactly one at x equals
zero this function is called the
exponential function whereas 2 to the
power of x + 3 to the power of X are
just exponential functions as this
exponential function the exponential
function is so important it gets a
special name it's not just e to the
power of X it's called X of X this is
the natural exponential function and we
already know that its base is e is a
number between 2 &amp;amp; 3 now we can start
from this idea and compute Euler's
number E is nothing but e to the first
power great let me write this one as
10,000 divided by 10,000 up to now this
looks completely crazy where am I going
I'm going to apply the laws for powers
this is e to the 1 over 10,000 to the
power of 10,000 remember that rule if
you take a power of a power you multiply
the exponents this is what you get but e
to the power of 1 over 10,000 that's
something pretty close to x equals 0 on
this blue curve so rather than looking
up the value on that blue curve i'm
using the red line the tangent line to
compute that value to approximate that
value that is the slope is 1 so we can
just put x in here plus the y-intercept
is one as well and now i'm using this
equation for the tangent line to
approximate this value the value of e to
the x at x equals 1 over 10,000 so this
is approximately equal to 1 over 10,000
plus 1 we
simply looked up that value using the
tangent line let me plug that in then we
have e is approximately equal to I
change the order here to make it look
nicer 1 plus 1 over 10,000 to the power
of 10,000 guess what we have an equation
will an approximate equation for Euler's
number the official definition for
Euler's number is the following e equals
the limit of n goes to infinity of 1
plus 1 over N to the power of n I hope
that you can now easily guess where this
comes from the larger this number gets
the better these approximations get and
the result is 2.7 something footnote
this equation is pretty elegant when it
comes to deriving e but when it comes to
computing the actual value of e this
equation is pretty inefficient</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
