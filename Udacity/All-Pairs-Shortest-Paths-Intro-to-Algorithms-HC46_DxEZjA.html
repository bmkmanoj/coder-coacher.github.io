find the most central node in a social
network it's useful to be able to take
each node in the graph and find out how
far it is from all the other nodes in
the graph to get a score for a
particular node and then to repeat that
operation essentially to find out the
distance from every other node to every
other node so really what we want to
know is the shortest distance between
any pair of nodes so all pairs we would
like to know that the distance the
length of the shortest path now given
that we can execute a shortest path from
any given node in M times login time we
can just repeat that algorithm just one
at a time for each node run Dijkstra
here's a node and run Dijkstra here's a
node run Dijkstra so you repeat it for
all the nodes so we get n the number of
vertices times M log n for the total
time to get the distance between all
pairs of nodes this quantity can have a
range of values depending on how densely
connected the graph is if the graph is
connected but very sparse M is the same
as n so we get N squared log in if the
graph is very densely connected then the
number of edges is roughly the square of
the number of vertices and so the
running time at least in terms of the
number of vertices now becomes an cubed
log in now you can do a little bit
better than this using the fibonacci
heap idea that I was mentioning before
but this you know maybe this is the best
that you can do in terms of practically
implementable code this on the other
hand though we can we can beat this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
