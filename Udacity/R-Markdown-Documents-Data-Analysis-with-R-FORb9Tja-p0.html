with data frames you downloaded an R
script earlier and saw how we can save
our work and run our code from it for
your next task you're going to download
an RD file and run code in it you can
download the R and D file from the link
and the instructor notes the file will
look something like this
notice how this file is slightly
different from the file that you saw
before an R script can only have our
code and comments this file however the
RMD file allows us to do so much more
it's an R markdown document RR MD now
you might be wondering what our markdown
is and basically it's a simple
formatting language that lets us author
web pages if you want to know all that
you can do with mark town go to help and
then go to markdown quick reference this
would bring up the documentation for
markdown you can scroll through some of
the examples in the formatting we've
also included a video in the instructor
notes that will go through markdown so
far this file only contains text that
will be formatted using markdown let's
add some our code to this we can do this
by clicking on chunks and then going to
insert chunk now if you're friendly with
a keyboard you can use the shortcut
command option I there's many other
shortcuts in here and you can see them
here in this menu here I've added some
code to see what this data set is this
is the cars data set that also comes
with our and it contains 50 observations
of speeding and stopping distances for
cars in the 1920s I'm gonna add this
text as the title to this document so
that way it's more descriptive of my
file
I'll also run the stur command on this
data frame so that we can see what's
inside of it it looks like I have two
variables speed and distance which are
measured in miles per hour in feet not
only can we run our coding at the output
from these files we can also embed
images this plot function comes with the
base graphics package in R but don't
worry learning more about it we'll be
using the ggplot2 package which is the
powerful graphics language in the coming
lessons when I run this code I get a
simple plot of speed versus distance now
what's really amazing about this
document is that we can click the knit
HTML button this will generate a webpage
that includes both content as well as
the output of any embedded R code this
simple button allows us to ease
share and publish our work that's enough
about R&amp;amp;D files well let's have you work
in one now download the RMD file if you
haven't already and run and write code
when you're prompted to do so at the end
of the file you'll come across a
question I want you to answer that
question for this next quiz and then you
can continue on with the rest of the
lesson good luck and have fun</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
