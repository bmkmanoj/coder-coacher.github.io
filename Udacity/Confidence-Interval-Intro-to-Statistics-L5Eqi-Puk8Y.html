statistics it applies to coin flips and
many of the other examples we discussed
before a candidate an election might
have a true chance that any given voter
who votes for him let's call this chance
p same as a coin flip and of course if p
is louder than 0.5 in a two-person
runoff that person will not naturally
win in mind in most cases not always but
as a decision we can't assess the tool
chance so we do is we form a sample in
coin flipping we flip n coins in
elections we ask and randomly chosen
people as we know this gives us an
estimated mean it gives us also a
variance and therefore a standard
deviation of what's new now is the
confidence interval and the conference
in what is not the same as the variance
in fact drop the consideration of the
variance what this says is based on the
outcome we believe for the parameter mu
this is the best guess we can get which
is usually the maximum likelihood
estimate but we are not quite certain so
you're going to assess a wider range in
which we believe with high probability
that whatever the outcome will be that
the outcome will be with high
probability within this range very often
this range is defined as ninety-five
percent chance that the final outcome
falls into this range that will take
some work to compute so let's dive in</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
