we use them for catching errors which we
can also use during testing but they
also serve as documentation tools for
programmers because they show what the
assumptions of individual methods are
and they show what the individual method
is supposed to produce now let's apply
assertions to another program and old
favorite of ours are buggy HTML stripper
from the first unit so here again we
have a function to remove HTML markup
which you already know from the first
unit here as well a simple assertion
would have sufficed to catch the error
namely an assertion that checks for the
non-existence of HTML tags in the output
such an assertion could be something
like this we simply check whether
there's any less than sign that is the
beginning of an HTML tag in the output
we assume there's none and if there
would be one then the assertion would
immediately fail so here comes the quiz
with this assertion which input would
cause the assertion to raise an
exception is it foo in bold is it foo in
quotes in bold is it foo in bold in
quotes or is it foo in bold and single
quotes which of these causes the
assertion to fail over to you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
