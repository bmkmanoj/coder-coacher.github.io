here I will attempt to make an instance
of class movie in much the same way we
did for class turtle I will start by
creating a new Python file I will then
save this file in the same folder as my
previous Python file and I will call
this new file entertainment center dot
pi so here are my two Python files that
I've created thus far
here's the first one where I began to
define the class movie it was called
media dot pi and here is the new file
called entertainment center dot pi now
here in this new file I will say import
media now notice that this is my media
file which is where I was beginning to
define my movie class and therefore with
this line of code I am telling my
program hey here I want to use the
contents of my previous Python file then
I will go on to say Toy Story is equal
to media dot movie so you may notice
here that Media is the name of my
previous pipe on file and movie is the
name of the class that's defined inside
that file one quick side note here is
that I did not have to create a new file
in fact I could have written this entire
piece of code right here in my previous
file but it is good practice to keep the
class definition in one file and to call
your class or to use your class from
another file okay let's continue so
there is one thing I want to highlight
here which is that this line of code is
pretty similar to how we created the
turtle Brad in both cases I am saying
some module or file name dot a class
name now
the next thing we have to do is figure
out exactly what happens when we run
this line of code one way to do that is
to remember what happened behind the
scenes when we created the turtle Brad
so let's investigate that together
do you remember what happens when we run
the following line of code here are some
answer choices a function named init is
called it initializes or creates space
in memory for the new instance Brad or a
function named de L or del is called
it deletes the instance Brad a function
named CMP or compare is called it
compares the instance Brad to Angie or I
don't know tell us what you think</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
