and trinomial so that way we could talk
about polynomials I'll be saying those
words a lot so I wanted to make sure
you're clear on them for example here we
have a trinomial in another trinomial
and we're gonna try and add these
together before we get started I'm going
to show you some algebra tiles to help
us think through this here's a square
and each side of the square is X units
in length I don't know it but I do know
that the area of the square is X times X
or x squared this rectangle has a length
of 1 on one side and x on the other so
the area of this rectangle would just be
X and finally this last tiny square it
has an area of 1 it's a 1x1 square I
drew these shapes out to help us think
about like terms so let me show you what
this problem would look like using these
shapes for this first trinomial I would
have three X Squared's four X's and
three or three ones you can see a
similar representation for the second
trinomial so if you want to add these
two polynomials together we want to
combine the like terms to add like terms
together we simply add up the
coefficients of the same term so 3x
squared + 2 x squared would make 5 x
squared 4x + 2 X would make 6 X's + 3 +
1 would make 4
I can rearrange my terms in the first
polynomial in the second polynomial to
get my like terms now that we have this
we're ready to combine like terms here
was the original problem and for just
adding we can drop the parentheses and
rearrange to find our like terms so we
have 5x squared plus 6x plus 4 this is
the trinomial we get when we add these
two together</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
