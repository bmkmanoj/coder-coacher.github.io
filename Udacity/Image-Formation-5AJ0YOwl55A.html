of how an image is formed from a 3d
scene we start off with just a simple
representation of a 3d scene we have a
lens and of course because of this lens
now we know that we can actually create
an image of this 3d scene on the other
side of the lens here I'm basically just
not showing you a simple paradigm where
again a lens all the light goes through
the lens here generates a 3d scene and
this is basically all the light from
this thing is now going through this
lens and captured here most of the time
we will actually be putting a sensor
where we want to capture the image at
the focal plane of a lens so that F
distance away from the lens we want to
be able to capture the image and this is
where actually we want to be able to put
our sensor and that you will see various
examples on why that's important let's
look at a few examples of what happens
if certain things change in this image
formation pipeline again we have a 3d
object lens and at the image being
formed at the focal point of this lens
so as I said now I'm gonna push the
sensor a film or any form of a screen
here that's going to be where we want to
capture images you may remember this was
the concept that was there in the
pinhole camera in the previous lecture -
we always wanted to create an image at
the focal plane away from the lens so
what happens if I was to now move this
tree further away from the lens so
everything else is the same I've just
moved the tree here by doing simple
geometry on this one you will notice
that when you take and trace the rays of
light through the lens a tree is formed
on the image sensor except that now of
course it's much smaller this is the
image size here of course it's much
smaller on this side here and that's
valuable because in essence as I move
the tree farther away of course it
should look more distant so this is
exactly doing what we expect it to do
and if I had let's say two trees one
front and one and back the further one
should be looking smaller so this is
kind of giving me a sense of depth of
perspective
which basically says things farther away
will be smaller now let's look at what
happens if I move the tree inwards same
lens same situation same location of the
sensor and of course if we just draw the
rays of light and do the projection
again you will notice that this time the
tree is bigger so this tree is smaller
and of course this tree is much bigger
and again same example applies it's
closer to the sensor therefore it
appears to have more size and appears to
be larger so this just demonstrates that
by changing distances of the object to
the lensing system the camera here we
can now actually see closer or farther
off objects</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
