numbers and people for instance if we
didn't have the phone book yet we could
start with every phone number and call
every person and ask for their names
you'd go through a brute force face that
may take a couple of months but once
you're done with this you have this this
beautiful phone book or code book as
they call it in cryptography that allows
you to do the second and third and false
and infinite number of lookups in
basically zero time so that's the basic
idea of an attack that then uses very
little time in fact zero encryption
functions are needed after the
pre-computation phase but that that
invests storage in this case discharge
to store every possibility to to achieve
the faster computation that's the basic
scheme that in this case is not
practical because this amount of storage
would equal petabytes in fact hundreds
of petabytes and that starch available
to know hecka in the world Google may
have this much but nobody wants to to
break gsm phone calls for cheap so we
need improvements on this scheme luckily
there are many possible choices between
this one extreme to code book that uses
a lot of storage and very little time
and the other extreme brute force that
uses a lot of time but very little
storage and those we want to discuss
next some trade-off points are achieved
by a technique called time memory
trade-offs and that works as follows we
can start with a table of many of these
keys and for each of them again apply
the encryption function but not just
once but several times and after
resulting data set that of course will
be of the same amount of samples again
we won't have
same coverage we throw away most
everything things in the middle and only
keep the first and the last column now
this should be an equivalent in coverage
to a data set that in the simpler scheme
took a lot more storage capacity and
here's how you're looking up a message
found in the in the last column then
clearly it works as before you find the
messages that encrypted message on the
air in this last column and you look up
the key through following the chain that
led up to to this message so after
finding the message in the last column
you go to the matching entry of the
first column and compute the encryption
function in this case twice that's the
that's the key you want it however how
do you find now a message that's in the
middle that you didn't infect store on
the hard disk for this you'll have to
apply the encryption function first and
you then find this parameter three is is
configurable of course and to create
something of the size of of the GSM
64-bit key we would want to choose a
parameter more on deal on the magnitude
of a million so this table becomes a
million columns white of which you only
store the first and the last now if this
before took petabytes and now you only
have to store a millions of it you're
down to two manageable terabytes and
that's exactly where we want to be to
launch this attack on on normal today's
computers there is a large amount of
academic work to solve these
practicality problems two of which want
to look into dissolve exactly these two
problems now the first one called
distinguished points distinguished
points work after the dis principle um
you again start
with a large list of keys and for each
of these you start computing encryption
functions other than before though
you're not competing a certain number of
encryption functions but rather your
computing until you hit a certain
distinguishing criteria often times the
number of zero bits at the end of the of
of your output each of these
computations are may terminate very
quickly or terminate very late so
they're very in in length 2 chainz the
number of 0 bits however determines the
average length so instead of a square
data set so to say where you have a
stable height and a stable with you get
more zigzag a data set where each line
is of different lengths but on average
it will have the same coverage now this
solves the hard disk bottleneck because
you don't have to go through your
computation and chain link by a chain
link look up on the hard disk you know
that nothing that doesn't have the right
number of zeros at the end will ever be
stored on the hard disk so you keep
computing up to let's say on average a
million and only then you have to do one
hard disk look up so this scheme is
clearly superior to to the first one in
that it requires the same number of
encryption functions it requires the
same amount of storage but it only
requires a single hard disk look up and
so really now you are at seconds
terabytes and for the hard disk 0
milliseconds solving the second bottle
neck the pre-computation expense that's
a little bit more tricky and there's a
technique neither that gives just this
whole project its name
so called rainbow tables rainbow tables
look as follows you can start with a was
a long list of keys and you do the
encryption function for each of these
keys as before and you go through all
the colors of the rainbow its case a
million different colors with million
different encryption functions before
terminating your chain whether or not
you will need a high coverage very much
depends on your tech scenario of course
in GSM for instance as we saw before
there's a lot of different packets that
are attackable so maybe your coverage
for each single one of them can be very
low and in fact the project where that
that we computed the coverages much
smaller than 1 percent and that's still
enough to create each transaction with a
probability much above eighty percent so
the rainbow table helped us to some
degree where we actually mixed it with
distinguished points to to kind of mix
the benefits of both</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
