you basically convinced me to do the
writing and now you're the one who has
to actually think about what we want
what we learned no no what we'll do is
we'll end up sharing so you tell me what
we've learned that I'll tell you if it's
right so there was there was game theory
want to game theory too and they had
their own what have we learned along the
way right right all right so then what
happened when we came back there was
scooby-doo noises it was scooby-doo
noises then we talked about solution
concepts exactly and we focused we
listed a bunch but we focused in on two
of them right and I talked about
correlated equilibrium and the
relationship to Nash equilibria and sort
of how they're awesome and efficient to
learn or efficient to compute what's the
id what was the main idea of correlated
eakly what was the thing that was
introduced that makes it makes it work
traffic lights better known as a shared
source of randomization yes which I
don't think I ever actually said but yes
I heard it implicitly it was impaired
source of randomization other words that
one-third one-third that we did with the
cards was something that we both knew
that kind of allowed us to correlate
possible outcomes and that is again a
shared sorts of randomization and I
think even convince you that traffic
lights are kind of randomization from
your point of view when you get there so
it ends up being an easier solution
concept to find the values for but it
also is it requires more power you if
you don't have your source of
randomization you can't even use this
that's right but it is powerful and it
allows us to often come to a better
outcome than we would with the Nash
equilibrium some definition of better
higher expected utility for both players
for one player for the average player
well depend on the game and I think it
generalizes to arbitrary number of
players but the game matrices themselves
get really big if as the number of
players growing but that's true anywhere
yep exactly ok all right and then I
talked about a solution concept called
Coco values which had an even stronger
assumption not just that there's a
source of shared source of randomization
but there's actually binding side
payments mm-hmm meaning that there's a
mechanism for deciding who gets
but once the the actions have been taken
and utilities have been distributed
right and this encourages a player who
might not have a reason to do any
particular equilibrium to pick one that
is beneficial to one of the other
players because that person will share
in the increased benefit right so it
encourages a Pareto optimal response
that is to say that in particular
they're going to choose the outcome that
has the largest total reward and then
they're going to divide up that reward
did you mention Pareto optimal we were
talking about this no it was implicit
much like shared source of at
randomization</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
