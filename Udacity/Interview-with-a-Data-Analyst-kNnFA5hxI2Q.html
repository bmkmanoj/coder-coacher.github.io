data scientist at hired I also write for
several women in science blogs and I'm a
mentor with chick tech I chose to become
a data analyst because after I finished
my PhD in astrophysics I was trying to
think of ways that I could apply my
technical skills and my data skills but
in a way that was a bit more down to
earth than astrophysics so I see my role
as a data scientist or a data analyst is
to basically help other people in the
company make decisions and prioritize
their work by using the data that we
collect so that could mean helping
someone on our marketing team figure out
if one of their campaigns is working
that could mean helping a product
manager decide whether or not they
should ship a product change so I
remember when I first started trying to
learn how to code it was really
overwhelming and what I spent a lot of
time doing was looking at existing code
that was out there on the internet or
examples of analyses and using those as
a basis for me to try to expand on so
there's a lot of really great examples
online I'm kind of constantly searching
on google for how to do various things
and stack overflow has a lot of really
awesome examples of algorithms in
particular that you use in data
analytics and data science so for me
it's a lot about using worked examples
to help me work on whatever project I'm
working on and building on those first
and foremost it's important to learn
basic math and statistics skills because
you're going to be using those a lot in
whatever analysis you're doing then in
terms of technical languages it's very
important to know sequel because most
data sets you are going to need to pull
using sequel or some sequel like
language like Hadoop or MapReduce then I
would recommend learning some sort of
statistical package that will help you
do further analysis and further modeling
of your data
you can use our that's one package
that's popular I like to use Python
that's another package that's popular
but just anything where you can take
your raw data and then do more advanced
statistics and modeling and numerical
analysis on the data what excites me
about being a data analyst is getting to
be able to solve different puzzles every
day every day is different every day I'm
working on a new area of the business
and I'm helping people do their jobs
more effectively by using data it's
really fun it's always changing and it
uses tons of different parts of my brain
and problem-solving skills</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
