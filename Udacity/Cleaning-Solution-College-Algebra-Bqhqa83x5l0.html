choose between three different brands of
glasses cleaning solution to sell along
with his wiper sets one brand that
seemed like a pretty good option gave us
this equation y equals 10x plus 150 in
this equation X stands for the number of
gallons of cleaning solution that grant
orders y is equal to the total cost of
the order the solution costs ten dollars
per gallon and there is a flat delivery
fee of 150 dollars add on regardless of
how much solution was ordered before
gray decided how much solution to order
so what X should be based pretty much
just on how much he wanted or needed
when we plugged that number in for X the
function would output how much it would
cost him however grants being a bit more
strict with his budget these days and
instead of doing things the old way he
wants to set aside a certain amount of
money to spend on cleaning solution that
means that now we probably need to
switch up our equation a bit he's going
to want to calculate the amount of
solution ordered based on the amount of
money spent since now amount ordered
depends on money spent let's switch up
our variable names if we want X 2 equal
the total cost of the order and y 2
equal the amount of cleaning solution
ordered what will our equation look like
now remember that all of our quantities
are still related to each other in the
same way we're just changing their names</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
