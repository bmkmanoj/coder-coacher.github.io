complicated I'm going to give you a list
of numbers slightly different from the
one before those actually floating
numbers they have a decimal point and I
want you to implement the function
variance it takes in data and returns a
single number which is the variance of
the data so for the data set I will be
giving you it so turns out the variance
is 62.5 7/2 now some hints first you're
going to use the function mean that you
have already programmed so it's in your
code just use it and then the trick that
I want to play is we have our did we
have our list here inside the function
data I'm going to transform this into a
new list called n data it is the
normalized data which effectively is the
data minus the mean check or mu so you
compute the mean called mu perhaps and
then subtract from the data from each
data item the MU in the subtraction is
not entirely trivial to make a new data
set and the commands I've been using is
I iteratively construct with a for loop
then really does set first I set it to
an empty list and then there's this
function called append thought append
and whatever's inside the function you
got to figure this out will be appended
to this list over here so with an
initial assignment of an empty list and
a for loop we go through all the data
items and I append the appropriate thing
to this new data I get out this new data
list and then I can apply the same mean
function to the new data list and that
gives me the variance you got it if not
listen to the video again so here's the
coding environment a data set I've given
me the function mean that we've problem
before and now you are to program the
function variance so that when we print
variance of data set you get the desired
62.5 seven to eight eight four</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
