important step in this whole process
what we want to do is have a way to
convert a real number into an integer
across a limited scale in other words we
might have hundreds of individual values
here between 0 and 25 of a real number
and we want to convert that into an
integer say between 0 &amp;amp; 9 there's a
fairly easy way to do that and I'll show
you how right now so here's what we do
first thing is we determine ahead of
time how many steps were going to have
in other words how many groups do we
want to be able to put the data into
like I said before to have an integer
between 0 &amp;amp; 9 we would use 10 in this
case so we divide how many data elements
we have altogether by the number of
steps then we sort the data and then the
thresholds just end up being the
locations for each one of these values
so in other words if we had say a
hundred data elements and we were going
to have 10 steps our step size is 10 so
we just find the tenth data element and
that's our first threshold and then our
20th and 30th and so on it ends up
looking something like this when the
data is sort of sparse our thresholds
are set far apart when the data is not
sparse these thresholds end up being
closer together so in this particular
example our thresholds might end up
looking something like this and when we
go to query you know when we have a new
value in want to see what is it's
discretized value let's say it was a
value here boom it's between those two
thresholds so it would be 1/8</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
