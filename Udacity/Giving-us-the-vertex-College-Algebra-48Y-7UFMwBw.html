a times the quantity X minus H squared
this is almost the same as the equation
that we were working with in the last
lesson remember that we kept talking
about the form y minus K equals X minus
H squared and this is used for parabolas
that had a leading coefficient of 1 so
this makes perfect sense that if we have
leading coefficient of a instead of one
we would modify the equation like this
now two of these equations here are
actually not correct mathematical
representations what we're looking for
this one y minus K equals ax minus H
doesn't graph a parabola at all we can
see that we only have an X to the first
term not next to the second term this is
a linear equation that means it
definitely can't be right and the last
one right here doesn't have the correct
placement of the leading coefficient of
a as we can see from the last example we
did the second choice is mathematically
equivalent to the third one the correct
one except here like we saw in the last
quiz we can't directly read off the
coordinates of the vertex or we wouldn't
be able to if we had actual numbers
plugged in so this is the best choice</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
