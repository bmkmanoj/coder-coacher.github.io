this quiz if you really don't like money
I guess you could prefer not to be paid
at all the closest thing to a correct
answer is that it depends and it depends
on how you interpret the meaning of
bi-weekly we could look that up in the
dictionary to decide how we should
interpret it and if we look up bi-weekly
in the dictionary what we see is the
definition of bi-weekly which is right
here it says happening every two weeks
is the first definition the second
definition is happening twice a week if
you have the first definition
you'd rather be paid weekly assuming you
like more money if you have the second
definition
you'd rather be paid bi-weekly maybe
that's the problem with paper
dictionaries that they're not very
precise because they're old things let's
look up a more modern dictionary let's
see what Wiktionary has to say about
this so here's the Wiktionary entry for
bi-weekly and if we scroll down we can
see that it has two meanings occurring
once every two weeks occurring twice a
week this is chiefly in the UK the
American Dictionary didn't seem to think
that it seemed to think both definitions
occurred in both countries so this is a
pretty big problem if we wrote a
computer program and the program was
doing our payroll and had to decide what
it meant to pay someone bi-weekly we
want to make sure that it understood
that the same way the programmer did so
that's one important reason why we need
to invent new languages like Python to
program computers rather than using
natural languages that we already
understand and that's because we don't
really understand languages like English
or Mandarin that there's lots of things
that different people will understand
different ways and this happens at the
granularity of words like bi-weekly it
also happens in complete sentences where
there are many different ways to
interpret the same phrase another reason
we don't use natural languages for
programming is that natural languages
are actually very verbose to write a
program we need to describe exactly what
the computer should do in very precise
sequence of steps if we had to describe
all those details using a natural
language that would require a huge
amount of text so we'll see soon that
with a programming language like Python
we only need a few lines of code to
describe a complicated thing
and described in a very precise
step-by-step way so I want you to think
about as we write programs in this class
how much more detail you need to
actually describe in English precisely
how to do what we're describing with a
few lines of Python code</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
