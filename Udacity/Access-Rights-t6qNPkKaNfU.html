multiple users access a file system it
becomes clear that we will need some
notion of access rights looking at our
directory tree here again it should be
clear that Alice should not be able to
see guests or Bob's file unless they say
it's okay and we certainly don't want to
let just any user access the operating
systems files ultimately for each user
file pair we need to know what
permissions that user has that is which
of the basic actions of reading writing
and executing the file is he allowed to
do conceptually we can think of this as
a giant matrix with users for the
columns and files as the rows for
instance and we could store the
information that way but it would be
pretty inefficient think about how many
files would have the exact same set of
values unix-like operating systems
achieve efficiency by assigning an owner
and a group to each file here I'm
displaying this information as the LS
command would show in the terminal the
owner or user of the file is typically
the creator of the file and the group
might be faculty or staff or students or
something like that in the university
setting we have separate read write and
execute bits for the owner or user the
group and then another set for everybody
else this gives us a total of nine bits
instead of three times the number of
users on the system permissions on
directories make the system even more
complicated the basic rule is that
reading affects your ability to see
what's in the directory writing affects
your ability to create delete and rename
files in the directory
both of these are intuitive if you think
about a directory as a file itself
containing the names of the files and
subdirectories in it execute permissions
are a little more confusing as they
control whether you can pass through the
directory and access its contents in
ways other than just manipulating the
file names for cases where more detailed
permissions are needed access control
lists are sometimes used on various
operating systems these make it possible
to create arbitrary row values in our
permissions matrix by granting
permissions to individual users or other
groups defined in the file system I
encourage you to explore some more on
your own some good places to start are
provided in the instructor notes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
