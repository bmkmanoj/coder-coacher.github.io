basic statistics and machine learning
methods that you can use to analyze your
data not only can we draw conclusions
that are statistically sound about
existing data we can also make
predictions about the data that we might
collect in the future during this lesson
we've chosen to really zero in on a
couple of methods specifically Welch's
t-test and linear regression with
gradient descent but as you can imagine
this is just the tip of the iceberg
there are tons of statistics and machine
learning techniques out there if you're
interested I would really encourage you
to go out there and read more about both
stats and machine learning now that
you're familiar with these statistics
and machine learning techniques you'll
use them to make predictions about
Subway ridership in New York and also to
draw some conclusions about the existing
subway data that we have once you've
made these conclusions and predictions
you might find that you'd really love to
communicate them to other people be they
your friends or your teachers or your
family one of the most effective ways to
do that is through data visualization
that's what we'll cover in the next
lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
