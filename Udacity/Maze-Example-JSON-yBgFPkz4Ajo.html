example and I think you're really going
to like this now the code is almost
identical but what happened to all our
functions that help us visualize the
maze I'm going to show you something
that's pretty cool with playgrounds so
we're looking at the maze JSON example
if we drop this down let's look in this
sources dot Swift file ah now here it is
in this file we have all the functions
that we defined earlier that help us
visualize the maze so everything defined
in the sources folder so this sources
dots will fall and any additional files
we may have they can be accessed by our
maze JSON example so let's go back to
that file here and you'll notice just
some small differences between this
example with JSON and the plist examples
that we've seen but the difference is
small first we need to create a URL that
points to the JSON file instead of the
plist file then we load the JSON data
into an NS data object now this is a
little bit different that we saw earlier
at this point our data is raw it's not
organized into an array or a dictionary
we're going to have to do that ourselves
these next few lines of code use the do
keyword which we'll discuss later when
we get to errors do will allow us to run
some code that could potentially cause
an error but in our case it'll work as
long as we specify the filename here and
the extension correctly inside the do
block we run some code that will convert
the raw JSON data into a usable
dictionary then from there we can call
our visualize maze function again and it
visualizes the maze this string so now
we've created the same maze from two
different data formats with a plist and
with json that's awesome and for a
little fun i encourage you to try
messing with the truth values and either
the files and see how it affects this
maze that's ultimately generated</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
