corseting a graph you need a scheme to
decide which vertices to combine one
idea is to compute a matching so what's
that here's a formal definition matching
of a graph is a subset of edges such
that no two edges have a common endpoint
it's basically an independent set but
four edges as opposed to vertices for
instance take these three highlighted
edges they form a matching because they
don't share any endpoints that is
suppose you wanted to add this edge to
the matching bad OMS es student you
can't add this edge because it would
touch an existing edge of the matching
so that's a matching what's a maximal
matching a maximal matching is one to
which you can't add any more edges in
fact this matching is maximal in fact if
you go through all the remaining
unmatched edges you'll find that you
can't add any of them to the current
matching I want to contrast maximal to
maximum a maximum matching is the
largest matching for example this graph
has at least one more matching with more
than three edges in it can you find it
here's one though there might be more
okay back to maximal matchings maximal
matchings are easier to compute so we'll
focus on those indeed this is a good
time to check that you understand the
concept of a maximal matching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
