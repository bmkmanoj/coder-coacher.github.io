particular situation we're back to four
possible genotypic combinations and our
gametes having genes far enough apart on
the same chromosome allows alleles to be
mixed and matched in such a way that we
can get those missing combinations that
we wouldn't have gotten otherwise if the
genes were so close together and that
they appeared linked just so you guys
know if you've had any trouble
understanding this this is one of the
most difficult concepts to understand as
a beginner but it is also one of the
most difficult concepts to teach so if
you have trouble understanding this it's
probably all my fault and what I'd
really like for you to do is go to the
forums and chat with some of your fellow
classmates see what you've seen posted
there I'm going to try to put some
helpful links in the instructors notes
most of recombination is not something
that we really need a lot of for the
rest of the class other than
understanding the importance of
recombination and how it provides
genetic diversity but if you have any
interest in understanding it better or
knowing more please there are so many
great resources out there to help
understand this it is an amazing
phenomenon and biology and really is an
evolutionary marvel</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
