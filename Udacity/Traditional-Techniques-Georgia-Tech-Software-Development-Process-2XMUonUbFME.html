eliciting requirements many different
techniques have been proposed so here at
least the some of the most traditional
techniques for requirements elicitation
and as I present those please keep in
mind that these techniques can be used
separately or combined a first technique
is called
background reading and this technique
involves collecting information by
reading existing documents such as
company reports organizational charts
policy manuals job descriptions
documentation of existing systems and so
on and this technique is especially
appropriate when one is not familiar
with the organization for which the
requirements are being collected so you
want to get some background before
interviewing actual people and one of
the main limitations of this kind of
approaches is that written documents
might be out of sync and they often are
out of sync with reality tend to be
long-winded and may contain many
relevant details so you may have to look
at a lot of materials to extract enough
information the hard data and samples
techniques consist in deciding which
hard data we want to collect and
choosing the sample of the population
for which to collect such data and hard
data includes facts and figures such as
forms invoices financial information
survey results marketing data and so on
and the sampling of this data can be
done in different ways for example
typical ways to do random selection
interviews are another typical approach
for requirements elicitation and this is
the approach that we use for the first
project in this course for instance
interviews can be structured in which
case there is an agenda of fairly open
questions or they can be open-ended in
which case there is no preset agenda and
the interview is more of a conversation
on the positive side interviews can
collect a rich set of information
because they allow for uncovering
opinions as well as hard facts
moreover they can probe in-depth through
follow-up questions on the more negative
side interviewing requires special
skills that are difficult to master and
require experience and it is not enough
to collect a lot of information if this
information is hard to analyze or even
irrelevant it might become useless so
you need to know how to conduct an
interview in order to take advantage of
these techniques surveys can also be
extremely useful for gathering
requirements because they can quickly
collect information from a large number
of people
moreover they can be administered
remotely for example by email through
the web on the other hand
surveys tend to severely constrain the
information that the user can provide
and my miss opportunities to Colette
unforeseen relevant information finally
meetings are generally used for
summarization of findings and collection
of feedback so as to confirm or refute
what has been learned so the only
additional thing I want to mention about
meetings is the fact that it is
fundamental that have clearly stated
objectives in our plan carefully this is
something that should be quite obvious
but doesn't always happen in practice</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
