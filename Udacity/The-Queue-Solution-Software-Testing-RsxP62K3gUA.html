and so it doesn't necessarily need to be
the case the years looks very much like
a mind of all as long as it accomplished
in effect it's somewhat similar so we're
going to do here is is set n the size of
the queue 24 create a new queue of that
size and immediately call check rap
because basically every time we do a
queue operation we'd like to do the
check ramp so if anything goes wrong
with the queue we detected as early as
possible we also initialize an L to be
empty so this L and the queue are always
gonna contain the same number of
elements in the same order so lnq are
always going to have the same contents
so now we're going to do 10,000 random
tests and each test is going to be
randomly either in NQ or a DQ and if
it's in NQ we're going to NQ a random
integer now after in queuing we call
check rap and if the inclusive we're
going to append the item that we include
to our list which is marrying the Q's
contents and also increment variable
saying how many times this operation
succeeded on the other hand if the NQ
doesn't succeed or I want to assert that
the length of the queue I'm going to
search that the length of our list is
equal to n that is to say the list has
the same number of elements as a full q
assert that the queue is full call czech
rep again and also increment a counter
indicating we performed an add operation
on a full queue and we're not going to
talk about why these counters matter
just quite yet but we're going to look
at this a little bit later the DQ
structure is exactly analogous we're
going to issue a DQ operation with fifty
percent probability check wrap and then
we're going to do the sort of the
analogous empty checking operations that
we did and empty check your empty
checking operations if the if the DQ
operation failed and if the DQ succeeded
we're going to pop off an element off
our list and also ensure that it's
exactly the value that we expect so once
that loop terminates we're gonna go into
a loop whose purpose is to empty out the
elements of the queue and finally after
we've drained the queue of all elements
we're going to assert that our list
which mirrors the queue is also empty so
that's my little random tester for the
queue</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
