are described in Java doc here is an
example before the parenthesis you have
the name of the method in this case
pixels before the name you have the type
of the return value in this case that's
int because the pixels method returns
the number of pixels in an image as an
integer since you can't have half a
pixel let's look at another example the
Gros method again the name is before the
parenthesis and before that is the
return type but in this case remember
the grou method doesn't return anything
and we use this special word void to
denote that void means that nothing is
returned now this method call has
another feature it describes what kind
of arguments to pass you call this
method with two arguments and here you
find the types you can grow by any
decimal number it doesn't have to be an
integer now actually and that's a minor
detail that you don't really need to
think about until the next lesson what
you see inside here the double DW and
the double th are themselves variable
declarations they declare two variables
that are called the parameter variables
like I said right now you don't yet have
to worry about the parameter variables
but when you see the word parameters in
Java doc then you'll know where that
comes from now you know all the
technical terms that you need to
decipher a javadoc documentation</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
