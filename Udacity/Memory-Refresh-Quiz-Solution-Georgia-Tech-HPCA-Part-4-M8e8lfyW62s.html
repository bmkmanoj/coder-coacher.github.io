refresh quiz we have a memory with 4096
rows and this many columns it needs to
be refreshed every 500 microseconds and
this is a read timing where these two
steps in this one overlap so basically
it takes us 4 plus 10 plus either 11 or
2 plus 4 nanoseconds before we complete
one read and can proceed with the next
one because 2 plus 4 is 6 and 11
nanoseconds is longer that means that
really the timing for a read will be to
select the row so we need to select a
row get the values from the row and then
write the data back during this time the
row needs to remain selected so the new
read really cannot begin until 4 + 10 +
11 nanoseconds into it so the read takes
25 nanoseconds and that means we could
be doing 40 million reads per second if
all we had to do is do reads and this is
where it becomes tricky because during a
second we need to do a number of
refreshes the Refresh period is 500
microseconds so the number of refreshes
we have to do is 2,000 times per second
we need to do a refresh of each of the
rows to do that the row needs to be
selected we need to get the bit value
and write it back so it takes the same
time to do a refresh of the row as it
takes to do a read meanwhile our memory
cannot be doing the read so really we
are spending two thousand times 4096
time 25 nanoseconds on refreshes but
because they have the same timing as
reads we can just compute how many
refreshes we have per second and we end
up with eight point one nine two million
refreshes per second and that means that
we cannot do all 40 million reads pretty
much out of these really this was
assuming that we don't do refreshes so
because we have to do eight and change
million refreshes we have that main
les reads that we can do so the overall
result here is the difference between
the two that's how many reads do we have
left after we have spent time on eight
and change million refreshes so the
final answer here is the difference
between these which is 31 million eight
hundred eight thousand reads per second
so again without refreshes we would be
able to do 40 million but because
refresh is need to happen we only have
this many reads left in a second</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
