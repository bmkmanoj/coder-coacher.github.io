wants to fill in forms and I mentioned
before I wrote a book about web forms
the first two words in the book or form
suck which is very true right nobody
wants to go through that process of
filling in a form they want what's on
the other side they want that ride from
uber they want that book from amazon
they don't want to sit there retyping
their name for the Brazilians time and
ultimately it's almost an insult to the
person like technology is supposed to
change the world but the damn computer
doesn't remember what my name is how
many times must I type my name into the
same freaking computer before it knows
who I am like I said it's almost
insulting to people to treat them that
way so my ultimate example of the best
form is no form and that's why I like
these things that get you down to a
single tap or something where you can
just instinctively say I want that and
get what you want we are a long ways
away from that in any cases but there
are a couple examples which is very
promising and usually that's how things
start and you'll see one or two examples
that people say oh that's unachievable
but gradually more and more people get
to that point and it becomes the new
norm</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
