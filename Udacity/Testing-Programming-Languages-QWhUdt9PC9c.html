there's a node encouraging students to
write their own test cases how does one
write good test cases that's a
surprisingly difficult question it turns
out that there's an entire area of
software engineering practice and
research devoted to testing huge amounts
of money are spent each year on software
testing it's an amazingly expensive
prospect and thus coming up with good
test cases is really both an art and a
science formerly the basic idea behind
testing is to make sure that a program
implementation adheres to its
specification that is that what you've
actually written down does what we think
it should do or what you were required
to do so if the goal is to make a
procedure that finds the biggest element
in an array good test cases or a good
test suite would give us confidence that
you've done just that now unfortunately
for interesting programs there are an
infinite number of possible test inputs
for example even if you're just trying
to write a program to some the elements
of a list there are an infinite number
of possible lists of numbers that you
could pass in his input we don't have
time to run an infinite number of test
cases so often when we write just a few
and hope that they're indicative in some
sense or maybe we hope that they would
be very powerful and help us detect
errors if there are errors or bugs in
our programs so one goal for writing a
good test suite for making a bunch of
test cases is to say oh if I run all of
these test cases I'll have confidence
that there are no bugs well that's
easier said than done how do we actually
do it one hint that I would give is to
think about corner cases to play a
little game in your mind imagine that
someone else wrote the program and
they're trying to be deceptive they're
trying to sneak it past you and find
mistakes it turns out that the human
brain is actually very good in the same
way that we're very good at vision at
finding or detecting cheating or
deception when we think someone is
working against us take a step back if
you can from the code pretend it's not
yours take another look a fresh look at
this
vacation the statement of the problem
and see what you might check for example
for numbers be sure to hit all the
corner cases try 0 try some negative
numbers try some positive numbers some
try some primes try some composites for
lists be sure to try the empty list all
the numbers in order all the numbers in
reverse order all the numbers in a
random order if maybe the inputs are
grammars or strings try some shorts
trains and some long strings and
grammars with and without recursion this
is really more event art than a science
although you may be interested to learn
that there are a bunch of great research
efforts in automatically constructing
test cases basic idea is this you give
me your program and i'm going to write
another program that stares at it and
notices all the loops in all of the if
statements and i'm going to try to
generate inputs maybe at random that
will cause you to take all the possible
branches in your program so if you have
an if statement that says if x is less
than 10 i will generate one input where
x is 9 and another way x is 11 to force
you to go down both branches that way if
there's something wrong on one of the
branches like you use a variable that
hasn't been previously initialized
you're more likely to find it and that
field is known as automated test input
generation and it is still in its
infancy we have not solved it in any way
and that means that there's room for
creativity one of the themes in this in
this class is that whenever there are an
infinite number of possibilities but
that we can't use all of them like in a
grammar there's room for creativity we
have to think of the best ones we have
to do design under constraint and
unfortunately ultimately that's the best
answer I can give you here try to think
adversarial II think about all of the
corner cases available now are some
practice problems in which I go through
essentially I pose homework problems to
myself and solve them you can find them
in the list of videos and in each one I
inject a bug a defect I make a mistake
and i show how i would use testing and
debugging print statements and whatnot
to narrow it down if you're curious or
you want a little more practice with
testing and debugging check those videos
