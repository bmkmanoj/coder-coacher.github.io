classification and regression we'll go
into more detail on everything that I
write here but I want to give you a
quick overview just so you know what to
look out for in this lesson the first
thing I'll mention is the output type of
the algorithm as you know for supervised
classification this is going to be
discrete in the form of class labels for
regression this is continuous which
basically means that you'll be
predicting a number using a regression
the next question a very important
question is what are you actually trying
to find when you perform a
classification or a regression in the
case of classification this is usually a
decision boundary and then depending on
where a point follows relative to that
decision boundary you can assign it a
class label with a regression what we're
trying to find is something we usually
call a best fit line which is a line
that fits the data rather than a
boundary that describes it this will
make a lot more sense in the next couple
videos the last thing I'll mention is
how to evaluate when we were doing
supervised classification we usually use
the accuracy which is whether it got the
class labels correct or not on your test
set and for regression we'll talk about
a couple different evaluation metrics
one of which is called the sum of the
squared error another one is called
r-squared I'll tell you a lot more about
both of these in the middle part of the
lesson the main point I want you to take
away from this is that while regression
isn't exactly the same as supervised
classification a lot of the things you
already know about supervised
classification have direct analogs in
regression so you should think of
regression as a different type of
supervised learning not as a completely
new topic that you now have to learn
from scratch</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
