concept these are called HTML attributes
they look something like this we still
have our opening tag name and the
closing tag as before with the slash but
we have a new thing called an attribute
attributes have a name in this case I
just called it adder equals and you've
got quotes and the value is inside the
quotes and attributes these days always
equal a value then used to be the case
to be honest but everything we're going
to do is is equals a value and tags can
actually have multiple attributes an
example of a tag that uses an attribute
is the anchor tag which is the a tag and
a full example looks something like this
you've got the opening a you've got an
attribute called href you've got its
value which in this case is a URL you've
got the contents and then you've got the
closing anchor tag so if we were to
render this in HTML we would just see
the word derp but it would be a link to
reddit comm anchors are for making links
let's play around with this in our
browser a little bit and see it in
action okay so we've got our HTML from
before I'm going to clean out some of
these tags here so we have a little bit
more room to work let's make the words
HTML here a link so we're going to make
an opening a tag an href to www 3 c org
slash HTML and a closing a tag when we
render this we see that HTML has turned
into a link and if I were to click this
it would open this page w3c org in a new
window pretty neat huh okay so quick
quiz take the phrase below will take the
words my favorite from the phrase below
and make those words a link to Udacity
