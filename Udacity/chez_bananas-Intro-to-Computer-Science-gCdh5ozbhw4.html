a restaurant object and we see that it
has the is yummy method we define that
all these returns false but is yummy is
just an attribute we can assign that to
something else so let's create a new
function will call it really yummy that
always returns true and just to test it
really yummy returns true so now what we
want to do is replace the value of the
is yummy attribute of chez bananas with
really yummy and now when we call this
procedure well we're just calling the
really yummy procedure we defined it
always returns true note that there is a
difference here the is yummy is a method
and that implicitly is bound to the Shea
bananas object the really yummy takes no
parameters it's not a method it's just a
procedure that always returns true and I
should have a very clear warning
although we can do this it's really
confusing so please don't do this don't
reassign methods to new values unless
you've got a really really good reason
and if you've got a really good reason
for wanting to do this kind of change
posted on the discussion forums and make
sure that people agree that it's a
really good reason there probably isn't
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
