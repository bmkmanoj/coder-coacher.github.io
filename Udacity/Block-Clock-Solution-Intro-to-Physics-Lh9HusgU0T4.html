into three parts in the first part the
block is moving from exactly the center
where it's just hit the timer over to
the spring in the second part it's in
contact with the spring compressing it
and then finally extending again and in
the third part the block is moving to
the right back towards the timer note
that this problem is completely
symmetrical so it's sufficient for me to
solve the problem on one side and I know
the same thing is going to happen on the
other side so I only need to solve for
one period of the block moving over here
and bouncing back to the timer and I
know the same thing is going to happen
on the right side so in the first part
the block needs to travel a distance of
1.5 meters and it's going at a velocity
of V 0 so I'm going to use this
kinematics equation here and I know that
the acceleration is going to be 0 during
this part so I can cross out this term
and doing a little algebra and plugging
in my values here I find that the time
it takes for the block to move this
distance of 1.5 meters is equal to 1.5
over V 0 so I'm actually going to skip
part 2 for a second and move on to part
3 and in part 3 we said that the block
is moving to the right and needs to
cover the same distance of 1.5 meters
again and we know from conservation of
energy the kinetic energy of the block
has to be the same both before and after
it makes contact with the spring which
means that its speed will actually
remain the same both before and after
since the mass is remaining the same
this means that part 3 is actually an
exact mirror image of part 1 the block
is just moving to the right this time
over a distance of 1.5 meters at this
same speed V 0 except this time it's to
the right so we can actually conclude
right away that the time for part three
is just equal to 1.5 over V 0 just like
part 1 now what about part 2 well I made
the argument in the question that the
time that the block stays in contact
with the spring is actually equal to
one-half of the period not the full
period of the oscillation of the spring
and this is because at this point the
spring is just about to pull back on the
block but because the block isn't
attached the spring can't actually pull
back on the block so the block is free
to move with the same velocity it has at
this point which happens to be the
maximum velocity as well as the velocity
that the block started with when it was
coming in V 0 so we can say that for
part 2 the time it takes is simply equal
to the period of the oscillation over to
all right now let's put these three
times together so if we add together
these three times and substitute in the
pier
did for the oscillations of a spring we
get this equation for the time it takes
the block to move away from the timer
and return back to it and we know we
want this time to be equal exactly to
one second and solving this equation for
V 0 I get that the original speed should
be equal to 1.0 8 meters per second
