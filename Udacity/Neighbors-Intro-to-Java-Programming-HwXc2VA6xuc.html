the loop for the rose and the loop for
the columns notice that the Rose jump in
steps of two will do the same thing for
the columns now we need to compute the
average of these four pixels let me draw
my little picture again so here its
position i j and i want to compute the
average of this one this one this one
and this one i already have the one and
i J this one here has row I column J
plus one the one over here has row I
plus 1 and column J and finally the one
over here has a row I plus 1 and column
J plus 1 I add those 4/4 and that's my
average and now I need to stick it back
into each of those four pixels I already
have the coordinates so I can just copy
them I'm almost done but I still have to
put in the bounds here when we talked
about the gas prices we were told what
the general rule is so let's just do
that the length of a two-dimensional
array is the number of rows and the
length of a row is the number of columns
let's see what it looks like when we run
it here was the original picture here
are the process gray levels now you
won't be able to see this on the video
but if you run this at home and you
carefully look at this arc for example
you will see that it is more pix elated
now the point of all of this was to work
with neighbors to figure out if you have
a pixel position what are the
neighboring positions then many many
image manipulation algorithms where you
have to do just that for example to blur
a photo to sharpen it or to process it
in other ways now you will work with
Sarah with an entirely different kind of
problem she will show you how to use two
dimensional arrays for a grade book with
a kind instructor who wants to know
which students are doing very well and
also which exams are too hard</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
