of operator called a contraction mapping
and we're gonna say and operators of
contraction mapping if it has this
property so be a sum operator and its
mapping value functions to value
functions if it's the case that for all
value functions so all value functions F
and G and some multiplicative factor
gamma which is less than 1 if it's the
case that the distance between be
applied to F and be applied to G has to
be smaller than or equal to gamma times
the original distance between F and G
then we say that B is a contraction
mapping that it's it's it's causing
things to get closer together tighter
together so this notation here is
sometimes called the infinity norm the
max norm and all it's doing is saying
this is a function of states and actions
so which is the largest what's the
largest state action pair in terms of
absolute value okay so that's just
saying what's the maximum value that the
function Q can have or that it currently
has that that's right so when we when we
write F minus G max norm really what's
the saying is what's the biggest
difference in Q values between F and G
and this is corresponding Q values
mm-hmm all right so so F minus G is
saying what's the biggest difference
between these two Q functions at any
state action pair whatever that largest
difference is we're going to multiply it
by something that makes it even smaller
and we're gonna say that for it to be a
contraction mapping has to be the case
that if you apply that mapping to F and
you apply that mapping to G the distance
between the resulting functions is even
closer together
then they started and that makes it a
contraction mapping okay yeah so this is
how we're gonna define contraction
mapping and and this is going to give us
all sorts of nice properties and it's
also going to happen a lot in the kinds
of operators we get in reinforcement
learning so just to be sure that I have
this right
since the infinity-norm finds the
biggest value and here you define the
difference between two functions at
least the nfinity difference between two
functions being wherever their greatest
distance is it's certainly the case that
over time as we apply this operator over
and over again the point where their
maximum is the state action pair where
the maximum is might change every time
right that's right so the the this max
norm is computing for the specific value
function that it's given where the
biggest value is the biggest absolute
value is and that could be different on
this side of the equation from this side
of the equation there's no reason that
it needs to be the same over and over
again and in fact when we're using B to
be kind of like a value iteration
operator it does tend to move around a
lot okay so you would expect it to move
around a bit at least as you're going
through value space yeah exactly and
however let's not worry about that quite
yet let's actually do some contraction
mapping examples on just scalar values
where it's really easy to reason about
them okay yeah but I think that would be
cool</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
