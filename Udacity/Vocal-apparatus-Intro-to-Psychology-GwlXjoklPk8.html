evolved such that we have the vocal
apparatus to be able to learn language
and in fact Skinner thought that we
learn language just like we learn any
other behavior and that's why he calls
it verbal behavior we are surrounded by
verbal communities and they teach us the
sounds and words that are effective in
that community and you'll notice that
parents use imitation and reinforcement
when teaching their children how to talk
that's right Johnny you said water good
job so in addition to reinforcement you
may also be punished for language for
example perhaps you set a curse word in
front of somebody you shouldn't have and
you got in trouble for it if you speak
differently to your friends than you do
to your parents or your grandparents you
would have what Skinner would say
audience control meaning you're
reinforced for speaking a certain way in
front of some people and speaking that
way in front of others you could
actually be punished if language were
discovered then why didn't Gina learn
how to speak well actually we saw that
Jeanne did try to speak and was
imitating but she was punished for it
remember her dad barked at her therefore
she had limited language skills finally
we're going to ask again why is it very
important and we hope that we can get
some practical applications from a
theory and it turns out theory of
Skinner in verbal behavior using
principles of operant conditioning has
been very effective in teaching children
with autism how to speak and they even
use these theories to teach individuals
with intellectual disabilities how to
speak</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
