full sibling relationship and the second
set represents a parent-child
relationship now why is this well let's
start with the parental one remember
that you receive a whole chromosome from
one parent and a whole chromosome from
another parent so if you compared your
IBS score the snv's on your chromosomes
you should have a complete matching set
for the whole length of a chromosome but
two siblings on the other hand didn't
receive the same kind of chromosome from
each parent because of what
recombination during meiosis so instead
they share segments of certain
chromosomes with each other from both
parents so in the chromosome they got
from dad they'll share some segments but
remember dad's chromosomes recombine and
so it's not the same for both children
the same thing with mom's chromosomes
you'll notice that there's roughly fifty
percent here in the parental child
relationship sharing fifty percent of
the DNA right one whole chromosome set
matches and the other one doesn't and
even in the full sibling case you end up
with roughly fifty percent if we add up
the shaded region it's about fifty
percent in the unshaded regions that's
also fifty percent so even though you're
half related to your full parents and
your full siblings the half thats
related is different when we look at the
order of the snv's on the chromosome
this kind of analysis is the basis for
something we'll learn about in just a
little bit called identity by descent or
IBD</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
