desus as the only illness necessary to
explain these hypotheses I did notice
that beta ptosis explains three of the
four symptoms but the patient doesn't
show the other symptom I also noticed
the combination of Delta Colin Depp
psicosis could also explain exactly
those three symptoms but generally I
think I would prefer to have one illness
explains the symptoms instead of two I
could also explain it with a combination
of beta ptosis iota algae and Kappa side
because although the patient has a
normal level of a I oh dal ja and Kappa
side cancel out I'd al-jalil of AIT's a
Kappa side produces a but again that's
more complicated than just explaining it
with a thesis there's a good answer
David note that David did several things
in coming up with his answer first he
made sure that his answer covers all the
signs and symptoms this is the principle
of coverage we want to make sure that
the diagnostic conclusion actually
accounts for all the input data second
we chose a single hypothesis over a
combination of hypotheses although the
combination could have explained this
data as well this is the principle of
parsimony in general we want a simple
hypothesis for explaining the entire
data third this hypothesis can have
radius interactions between them and
these interactions can make a diagnostic
task quite complicated fourth they would
use the term explanation this is an
important aspect or diagnosis we want a
set of hypotheses that would explain the
input data now this turn out to be
relatively simple exercise because there
is one single disease that can infect
explain all the input data what would
happen if there was no single hypothesis
that could cover the entire input data
or what would happen if there were
multiple hypotheses that could equally
well explain the input data does the
diagnostic task can be quite complicated</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
