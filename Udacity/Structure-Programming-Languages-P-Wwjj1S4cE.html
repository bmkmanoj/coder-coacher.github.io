complicated we can add parentheses to
show structure or grouping X minus 3
times 5 is different than X minus 3
times 5
Python regular expressions have similar
parentheses but they're written a little
differently the closing parenthesis
looks just the same but the opening
parenthesis the version we'll be using
in this class is three characters open
question mark colon as a simple example
this regular expression makes a group
around XYZ and then this whole thing can
be repeated one or more times so some
strings are XYZ XYZ XYZ and so on
suppose we want to find words made up of
combinations of musical notes in western
music the notes are often given names
doremi faso alati and you could put them
together in various combinations ray
fafa dodo ray stuff like that let's say
we want to recognize words that are made
up of these syllables in order or these
syllables not in order but in any
combination so we set out to try it we
can have a bunch of dough's or a bunch
of rays or a bunch of Me's
and let's say we're looking for all of
the matching strings in Mimi ray ray
medo de doo-wop and we want to see which
ones we get we'd like to get Mimi as one
ray ray as another Midori and then maybe
do just sort of as a corner case but
mostly these three but we will be
unpleasantly surprised we would really
expect something like me plus to get
mimi maximal munch rule why have you
betrayed us if you look over here you'll
see that actually every one of these
little musical syllables Mimi ray ray
Midori seemed to come out separately why
well if you think about it in the
regular expression mi plus the plus only
affects the eye so really this is
getting me me me an entire virtue of
selfishness rather than the thing that
we wanted and you can actually see this
over here at the end where do plus got
us do Oh from doo-wop so here the plus
isn't applying to the right thing isn't
by
correctly this isn't quite the right way
to do it this however is no doubt use of
the parentheses in regular expressions
open parentheses question mark colon
marks the beginning of such a group
closing parentheses and then here in the
middle we have doremi anything inside
this group can be repeated one or more
times this gets us just the answer we
were looking for for a more thorough
investigation of musical notes in the
associated words I recommend the sound
of music but it's also worth pointing
out that a very popular computer musical
format or interface mi di MIDI the
musical instrument digital interface
used for recording things like pianos or
synthesizers or drum sets is more or
less exactly what we've seen here
basically a list of notes and modifiers
in combinations over and over again
by contrast formats like mp3 or other
audio compression approaches for
recording voice do not follow this
general pattern or at least they don't
look like they do at first blush</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
