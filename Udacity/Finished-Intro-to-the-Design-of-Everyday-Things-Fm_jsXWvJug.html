congratulations you're at the end of the
course you've now learned a lot of
concepts through the last three projects
and taking the first steps to being a
designer so let me do a quick summary of
what we've gone over in this course
first of all there were six fundamental
design principles and that led to the
Gulf of execution the Gulf of evaluation
which led to seven questions that people
ask as they try to use something those
seven questions the ones that cross the
two gulfs illustrate the important role
of designers which is to communicate
communicate the conceptual model they
have to the person who's going to use
the product how do you do the
communication well it's via the product
itself the system image so how do you
cross that gap well the tools are very
simple its affordances and signifiers
and conceptual models and that's the
whole course through these three
projects you've learned a lot of
techniques that are really powerful
you've learned to go and observe the
world you've learned to create
invitations such as with the cue and
with the user interface
well screens are all around us so you've
learned some powerful techniques like
idea generation rapid prototyping and
user evaluation you can take that you
can get better at those things you can
learn more you can build and you can
change the world Hey
oh thank you you found it excellent
congratulations hey congratulations to
you too you like making this course I
enjoyed it too you know I hope you
enjoyed it just as much as we did is
