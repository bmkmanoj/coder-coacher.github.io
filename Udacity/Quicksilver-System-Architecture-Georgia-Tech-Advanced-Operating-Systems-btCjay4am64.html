done in the early 80s and here is a
sketch reproduced from their paper
interesting thing that you notice is
that this sketch is very similar to what
I showed you as a current structure of
networked operating systems in the
earlier panel it's a microkernel based
design and Quicksilver was the same
vintage as Mark from CMU and having seen
the structure of operating systems and
earlier lessons this picture should be
very familiar to you that all the system
services are provided above the
microkernel and the microkernel is only
responsible for Process Management IPC
and machine control and all of the
system services such as window manager
file system virtual memory and
communication all of them sit above the
microkernel and the system services are
implemented a server processes now the
late 80s was exciting time for
distributed systems there were no
laptops in that time we were moving from
CRT terminals cathode ray terminals
connected to a mainframe to the era of
office workstations what we routinely
call as desktops these days Quicksilver
was conceived as a workstation operating
system and the ideas that are enshrined
in the Quicksilver operating system
predates or were concurrent with many
things that we take for granted today
such as network file system remote
procedure call the internet the world
wide web and so on what sets Quicksilver
apart from the competition at that time
when new services such as window manager
for managing the real estate on the
workstation screen and how it should be
integrated into the operating system as
a whole services that may not be
available in the workstation itself for
example a file server may be remote so
integrating communication into the
design of the operating system was key
and services that are within a
workstation and a crossword
stationed on the network in the
distributed system need to recover from
failures rather than ad hoc mechanism
for each server to recover from such
failures quiksilver was the first to
propose transaction as a unifying
concept for recovery management of the
servers does the first operating system
to propose transactions and operating
systems and that's the reason you see
transaction manager as part of the
service provided by the operating system
a quick personal note I was a graduate
student at university of
wisconsin-madison in the early 80s and
spent a year in IBM research working
with the group that conceived and
designed this Quicksilver operating
system my dissertation research which
was on hardware support for inter
process communication used as an
experimental platform a precursor to the
Quicksilver operating system which is
called 925 recall what I told you
earlier that Quicksilver was intended as
a workstation operating system and 925
was the name of the operating system
that was a precursor to Quicksilver and
as you can imagine this is a pun on
office workstation 925 that was the name
given to internally to the precursor of
the Quicksilver operating system</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
