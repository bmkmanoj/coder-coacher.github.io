wagon-wheel algorithm that we just
talked about this systematic resampling
you start off with no new samples and
you build your the C's are gonna
represent the outer ring the cumulative
distribution function and essentially
each one represents the one before it
plus the extra new weight right so you
start off at the first weight and then
c2 is the sum of W 1 W 2 C 3 is sum of W
1 W 2 W 3 that's that outer ring okay
you can think of it that if it goes from
0 to 1 because everything sums to 1 then
the C's are sort of how far what
percentage around the clock have you
gone the next thing you do is you have
to pick remember I told you you you have
to sort of randomly throw down the wagon
wheel to start with well if the wagon
wheel has eight spokes the first spoke
has to go somewhere between 0 and 1/8
that's what this is right here right and
to the minus 1 1 remember to write is 1
over N that's the offset and then what
you do is you go around the outer ring
seeing wait did I pass by offset yet as
soon as I've passed it that's the CDF
part that I'm in so just drawing that on
here if this is my first one right and I
stand and this is where it starts on the
outer ring I say did I pass it yet I
said nope ok did I pass it yet yes I did
so this first spoke landed in W 2 then I
just go to the next spoke and I say did
my last marker pass it no I got to go to
the next one did this pass it yes so my
next one is from W 3 so that's all I do
is I initialize it and then I just count
up for however many samples that I need
I go and I grab the next wagon-wheel
chunk and I see we're on the CDF that it
lands and then I just return that set it
looks more complicated than it is and
it's a way of doing that sampling in in
linear time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
