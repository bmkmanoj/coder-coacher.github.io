complete a finite state machine so that
it matches exactly the strings that this
regular expression matches let's take a
moment to look at what this regular
expression does the first part matches
one or more A's or B's in any order then
we match zero more C's or together D and
E and lastly we have an optional F that
we match let's take it one part at a
time while simultaneously trying to
understand the finite state machine that
we have partially built below from the
initial state we go from one to two via
B well if we look at a regular
expression it's also valid that our
first character is an A so this probably
means that this transition is an A and
here at state two we repeat with an A
but we can also repeat with a B as well
and so far we have the first part of our
finite state machine in which we match
one or more A's and B's the next portion
is the c d e business and we see in our
partially finished finite state machine
we take an epsilon transition to 3 this
is 0 more matches and the F is optional
so at this point it is possible to
finish in an accepting state however we
can have as many C's as we want and then
still finish so this loop right here is
probably a C we still haven't dealt with
the D&amp;amp;E if we look at the D go down to
state 4 in order to finish an accepting
state we need to follow with an e and
the last part is the optional F there's
only one F and if it does matches we
still finish in an accepting state which
is exactly what happens when we go from
state 3 to state 5 and so these are the
portions of the finite state machine
that we're missing that perfectly match
the given regular expression</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
