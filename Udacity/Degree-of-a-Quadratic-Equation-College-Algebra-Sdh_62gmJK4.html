standard form for the equation of a
parabola as y equals ax squared plus BX
plus C so the equation that produces any
parabola should be able to be written in
this form and recently what we've been
doing is taking equations that are
written in the standard form and
replacing Y over here with zero so in
general that gives us something like
this now we know that this is no longer
an equation for a parabola this is not
going to give us any points to graph
since we only have X as our single
variable this value of zero isn't
varying so it's not a variable it's just
a constant this kind of equation or any
equation that you can write in this form
is called a quadratic equation now a
quadratic equation has one of the same
restrictions that the standard form for
the equation of a parabola did this
coefficient a here is not allowed to
equal zero what I would like you to tell
me now is what the degree of a quadratic
equation is think back to what you
learned about the term degree way back
the very beginning of the course</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
