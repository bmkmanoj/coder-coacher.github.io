case based reasoning recursively the
last time we considered problem which I
had to go from an office to a restaurant
and I found a way of doing that now
suppose that I have to go from my home
to the same restaurant so I don't yet
know how to go from my home to the
restaurant but I know how to go for my
home to my office and just last time I
figured out a way of going from an
office to the restaurant so there we
have it now I have a case retrieved for
going from home to office under the case
retreat for going from office to the
restaurant and I have a solution for
going from home all the way to the
restaurant this is an example of case
based reasoning the first time we
retrieve a case for solving a problem
the case provides a partial solution so
I take the remaining part which was not
solved make it a new problem and send it
back into the case memory now the case
memory finds me a new case and it takes
this new case and I compose it with the
previous case to get a full solution so
the return again to our programming
example when I'm designing a program my
file input is usually part of a broader
problem of persisting data between
instances of the program and thus the
real problem I'm solving is solving this
problem of how to save data when the
program isn't running I can then solve
that problem recursively by breaking it
down into the first problem of file
input and the second problem of file
output I might draw a case for solving
file input from one program I've done in
the past and a case for solving file
output from another program I've done in
the past so I've solved it recursively
by breaking it down into subproblems
david to build on what you just said the
same kind of thing occurs in design in
general often when we do design we take
partial solutions from multiple cases
for example consider the problem of
designing a MicroBot that can swim under
water in a very stealthy manner this
might remind me of a case of a copepod
which has large number of appendages and
swims in the water at very slow velocity
making minimum weight in the water
that's good
I now solve part of the problem the part
which had to do with moving steadily
under water
under slow speeds but that now sets up a
new goal how do I achieve stealthy
motion in the water at high speeds
and let me come up with a solution from
a different case so a squid for example
also swims stealthily underwater but it
does so we're creating a wake that
matches the natural wake of water around
it so here I first used the goal of
designing of micro BOTS that consuming
the water still delije to retrieve a
case of the cocoa pod that provided with
a partial solution so set up a new sub
goal to complete the solution the new
sub goal found a new case that of the
squid which give me the rest of the
solution and if it composed the two
partial solutions I get the complete
solution so what a shock just described
is something that we call compound
analogy which is a specific type of
adaptation by recursive reasoning if
you're interested in that example we've
provided a paper on it in the course
materials for this lesson so you can
read more about the process of adapting
those cases to solve that very unique
and complex design problem</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
