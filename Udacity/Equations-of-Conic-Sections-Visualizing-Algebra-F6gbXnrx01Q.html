we want to look at the equation we can
tell by the equation whether or not the
shape will be a circle and ellipse I
hyperbola or a parabola for the case of
circles there will always have the same
amount of x squared + y squared meaning
the numbers in front of x squared and
the number in front of y squared will be
the same even if I change these two to I
still have a shape of a circle and
changing the five I still have a perfect
circle so let's go back to a perfect
circle that has a radius of 10 units we
can change this equation to become an
ellipse all we need to do is make the
coefficients of x squared + y squared
different for example if I make this x
squared term have a coefficient of four
instead of one I get an ellipse the key
idea for circles and ellipses is that
there's a positive sign in between the x
squared term and the y squared term the
difference between them is that circles
have the same coefficient whereas
ellipses have different coefficients
here the coefficient of x squared is 4
and here the coefficient of Y squared is
1 we usually just don't list the one but
notice it's the same exact graph now if
we want to turn this ellipse into a
hyperbola will want to change this
addition sign to subtraction hyperbolas
will always have a subtraction sign
between their x squared term and their y
squared term so changing this to a minus
we get a hyperbola remember the minus
sign is like the knife that cuts open
our lips and inverts the sides so they
point outward and since our x squared
term comes first our hyperbola opens to
the left and to the right they point in
these directions but let's see what
happens moon to make the x squared term
negative and the y squared term positive
we have subtraction between the squared
terms so we know this graph will end up
being a hyperbola and look it is the
only difference is that now I hyperbola
opens up and it opens down and that's
because the y squared term comes first
it's positive whereas the x squared term
is
negative now there's one more conic to
look at the parabola a parabola has x
squared or Y squared but it doesn't have
both so in order to change this
hyperbola into a parabola let's change y
squared into just why now i'm also going
to change the value of 100 to 10 so that
way we can see the graph on here and
notice when we change y square root of
why we get a parabola the vertex is at 0
negative 10 and the parabola opens
upward and here's how you can tell if a
parabola will open up or if it will open
down we can rearrange this equation and
solve for y so first i'll subtract
negative 4x squared from both sides of
this equation this gives me negative Y
on the Left negative 4x squared on the
right and positive 10 on the right next
I'll multiply every term by negative 1
this will give me 1 y equals positive 4
x squared minus 10 and we can easily see
that all three of these equations
represent the same graph I could graph
this one and I can graph this one and
see that they all make the same parabola
since this parabola is y equals we know
it's going to open up or it's going to
open down and since the coefficient on
the squared term is positive it opens up
now if we make this coefficient negative
the parabola opens down so when
determining whether or not something
opens up or something opens down you
want to solve for the single variable
first and then look at the coefficient
of the squared term is it positive or is
it negative so we've seen a parabola
open up and down but let's see one that
opens left and right instead of the
having the parabola be y equals let's
make it be x equals so we'll make the X
term be a single X variable and the y
term be y squared doing that we see we
get a sideways parabola and it points to
the right and again we know this
parabola opens to the right since we can
rearrange this equation to be x equals
first we'll add Y squared to both sides
so we'll get 4x equals positive Y
squared on the right and positive 10 on
the right next we'll divide every term
by four
to get x equals one-fourth y squared
plus 10 force and when i graph each of
these equations I should see that
they're all the same since this parabola
is in the form x equals we know it's
going to open to the right or to the
left and since this number this
coefficient is positive 1 for our graph
opens to the right if instead we make it
negative one-fourth our parabola will
open to the left so remember y equal
parabolas open up and down and X equal
parabolas open right and left the sign
on the squared term tells us which
direction that is up and write for
positive down and left for negative</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
