favorite topics in this class
intelligent tutoring systems the idea of
intelligent tutoring systems is that we
know students learn best when they have
individualized just-in-time feedback
right there in the context of the
learning process they learn best when
they have someone sitting with them
saying hey you just made a mistake on
that kind of problem here's how to avoid
that mistake for next time or great job
on that problem you didn't make the
mistake now that you made previously the
idea here is that it's not that we don't
want to give all students this kind of
feedback we definitely do but we really
have difficulty doing so at scale we
can't give every single student a
one-on-one tutor to have during their
entire educational career but with
software we might be able to come close
intelligent tutoring systems is about
creating software agents that can
provide that same kind of just-in-time
individualized feedback to students
while they're learning and because
they're software agents they're
available all the time they don't have
an hourly cost associated with them they
get past a lot of the obstacles to
having one-on-one tutoring during your
entire educational career so in this
lesson we'll talk about intelligent
tutoring systems in some of the places
they've been most effective well
especially talk about how they exist in
two different general areas well form
problem domains that have a well
structured problem and a correct answer
and more poorly form problem domains
where the things to learn are a little
bit more fuzzy and a little bit more
difficult to observe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
