looks like we've created a test page
that's in udacity.com cs101
index of HTML and when we run get all
links we'll see all the links on that
page let me show you what the page is
first this is our test page for learning
a crawl so that's the URL that we're
using to get page and get all links from
that page and you see this page has
three links on it the first one goes to
crawling dot HTML the second one goes to
walking dot HTML and the third one goes
to flying in HTML
we'll look soon at the structure of
these pages when we do our web crawler
you can try that on your own in the web
browser for now what we're interested in
is finding these three links so when we
assign links to the result of get all
links we can print the value of links
that we get back and when we run that we
see a list containing the three links on
the page and because that's a list what
we can do useful things with it we could
extract the value at position zero and
get just the first link on the page so
think on your own if you could define
get all links if you're ambitious you'll
try to define this all by yourself
we're gonna step through how to do this
with a few quizzes because I think it's
quite a challenging thing to do all by
yourself but think about that by
yourself first and then we'll step
through it with a series of quizzes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
