clouds one is with the point clouds of
course our sample from the surface that
this depth sensor hits so you're what
you're getting is your is getting a
sampling of the surfaces which means
there are no volumes you have to infer a
volume right so even if there's a nice
sphere right here you're going to get
points along its surface and maybe if
you move around you'll get more points
from the surface but it's up to future
further processing to decide oh that's
this spherical volume so there's no
explicit representation of volumes there
is an interesting element to it and that
has to do with surface normals so I
assume you all know what a surface
normal is you've got geometry so the
idea is you've got some underlying
surface and at any given point you could
fit the tangent plane and the normal to
that plane that's referred to as the
surface normal that you can think of as
a first-order local approximation to the
surface point clouds actually have
surface normals and you might ask how is
that possible how is that possible well
because it actually the sensor it does a
variety of little processing to try to
find little local points nearby and fit
that tangent plane in order to estimate
the surface normal and sometimes that's
useful I will tell you that the surface
normal representation is less robust
than the actual location of the point
itself so this cute little needle
diagram in order to fit them you have to
essentially take a little Gaussian
around the the points that are there fit
a little tangent plane to those Gaussian
weighted points and then that gives you
an estimate the surface normal you know
you have to figure out how big a
Gaussian do you want to use is a little
bit like how big a Gaussian do we use
when we take an image gradient remember
that we used to have to smooth out the
image to get rid of the noise but more
you smooth it more you've spread out the
gradient same thing is true here the
more the more points you consider the
more smoothly the surface normal will
vary</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
