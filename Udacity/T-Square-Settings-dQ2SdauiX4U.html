by clicking preferences the home screen
here will let you modify your active
classes to remove a class from your
active sites list select the class then
click on the right arrow to show a class
select the class and click the left
arrow to add it back to your active
sites so let me go ahead and hide the
classes that I'm not currently in then
I'm going to click update preferences
then once i refresh the page I will only
see those two courses at the top of the
page so again this won't remove your
access to the classes altogether this
just toggles which classes appear above
you can always access any class you've
already taken by clicking membership up
here as you can see here are all the
classes that I have taken at Georgia
Tech generally in the LMS program you
probably won't take enough classes to
really need to worry about hiding
inactive classes but if you've done
other degrees in the past at Georgia
Tech you might need to hide some of
these my box is eighty two classes so I
definitely need to hide some so once you
start the program you might receive more
notifications than what you would like
to see therefore in order to tweak this
you can go to the notifications tab at
the top here you can play with some of
these features and opt in to receive
only the messages that you would like to
receive so in my case I only want to be
updated about new resources once per day
so I would click here and then I would
update preferences here the most
important one though is the ability to
change your time zone this isn't a big
deal to on-campus students what online
it's crucial we encouraged most of our
classes to make their assignments due at
midnight UTC minus 12 time zone but it's
hard to translate that to your local
time so even though I'm an Eastern time
zone let's pretend I'm in Pacific I
would then select Pacific and then I
would update preferences so now that
I've switched over to Pacific time zone
all of my assignments show that they are
due at 5:00 a.m. Pacific
we'll talk more about the assignment
screen in a bit so that covers the
settings that affect tsquare as a whole
any change you make here will affect
every class you're currently in in t
square so now let's take a look at some
of the tools that apply only to
individual classes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
