the application that is giving this
illusion of a global virtual memory this
layer is the DSM software implementation
layer that implements this global
virtual memory abstraction in particular
this year some software layer which
exists on every one of these processors
knows at the point of access to a page
by a processor who exactly to contact as
the owner of the page to get the current
copy of the page for instance let's say
that there was a page fault on this
process of one for a particular portion
of the global address space that portion
of the global address space is currently
not resident here in the physical memory
of processor one so the page fault over
here and these are cooperation as I
mentioned earlier between the operating
system and the DSM so when the page
fault happens that page fault is going
to be communicated by the operating
system through the DSM software saying
that here is a page fault you handle it
what the DSM software is going to do is
it knows the owner of the page and so
it's going to contact the owner of the
page and ask the owner of the page to
get the current copy of the page so the
current copy of the page resides over
here so the owner either itself has the
current copy of the page or it knows
which node currently has the current
copy of the page and so it's going to
send the page over to the node that is
requesting is the current copy of the
page is over here it's going to come
over to this guy and recall what I said
about ownership of the pages the
residency of this page doesn't
necessarily mean that this is the owner
of the page the owner of this page could
have been this node so the DSM software
would have contacted the owner and the
owner would have said oh you know what
that particular page the current copy is
on this node so the DSM software would
go to this node and fetch this page and
put it into this processor so that this
processor is happy so once the page has
been brought in to the
physical memory then the DSM software
contacts the virtual memory manager and
says I've completed now processing the
page fault brought the page that is
missing and put it into a particular
location in the physical memory
would you please update the page table
for this guy so that he can resume
execution well then the vo manager gets
into action and updates the page table
for this thread to indicate that the
faulting virtual page is now mapped to a
physical page and then the process or
the thread can resume its execution
so this is a way coherence is going to
be maintained by the DSM software as a
cooperation between DSM software in the
VM manager and the coherence maintenance
is happening at the level of individual
pages and early examples of systems that
built software DSM include IV from Yale
clouds from Georgia Tech mirages from
UPenn and muninn from rice all of these
are distributed shared memory systems
and they all used coherence maintenance
at the granularity of an individual page
and they used a protocol which is often
referred to as a single writer protocol
that is I mentioned that there is a
directory associated with the portion of
the virtual memory space managed by each
one of these nodes and the directory has
information as to who all are sharing a
page at any point of time multiple
readers can share a page at any point of
time but a single writer is only allowed
to have the page at any point of time so
if there is a writer for a particular
page let's say that this page which is
now currently in the memory of two
different processors if this guy wants
to write to this page then he has to
inform through the DSM software
abstraction inform the owner for this
page let's say this guy is the owner for
this page that I want to write to this
page and at that point the owner is
going to invalidate all car
piece of that page that exists in the
entire system so that this guy has
exclusive access to that page so that
they can make modifications to it so
this is what is called single writer
multiple reader protocol easy to
implement at the point of write to a
page what you do is you go through the
DSM software contact the owner and the
owner says I know who all have copies of
the page I'll invalidate all of them
once it has invalidated all the copies
then the guy who wants to write to that
page can go ahead and write to it
because that'll be the only copy now the
problem was a single writer protocol is
that there is potential for what is
called false sharing we've talked about
this already in the context of shared
memory multiprocessors basically the
idea of false sharing are the concept of
false sharing is that data appears to be
shared
even though programmatically they are
not let's consider this page based
coherence maintenance in the page based
coherence maintenance the coherence
maintenance that is done by the software
DSM software is at the granularity of a
single page a page may be 4 Kbytes
or 8k bytes depending on the
architecture we are talking about and
within a page lots of different data
structures can actually fit so if the
coherence maintenance is being done at
the level of an individual page then we
are invalidating copies of the page and
several nodes in order to allow one guy
to make modifications to some portion of
that page and that can be very severe in
a page based system due to the coarse
granularity of the coherence information
so for example there's one page may
contain ten different data structures
each of which is governed by a distinct
lock so far as the application
programmer is concerned but even if I
get a lock which is for a particular
data structure that happens to be in
this page and this guy has a lock for a
different data structure which is also
on the same page when I get the lock
that is going to manipulate a particular
data structure in this page and if I
want to make modification
for it I'm gonna go and invalidate all
the other copies when he wants to make a
change he's gonna come and invalidate my
copy of the page so the page can be ping
pong in-between between multiple
processors even though they are
modifying different portions of the same
page
still the coherence granularity being a
page will result in the Space Shuttle in
back-and-forth between these two guys
even though the application program is
perfectly well behaved in terms of using
locks to govern access to different data
structures unfortunately all of those
data structures happen to fit within the
same pace resulting in this false
sharing so page level granularity and
single writer multiple reader protocol
don't live happily together they will
lead to false sharing and they will lead
to ping-ponging of pages due to the fall
sharing among the threads of the
application across the entire network</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
