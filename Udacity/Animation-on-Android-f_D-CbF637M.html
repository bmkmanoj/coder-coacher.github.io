lesson touching on both design and
implementation aspects of animation
let's start by jumping straight into
some code more specifically let's look
at how building animations with the
android sdk has evolved from its humble
beginnings to the powerful and flexible
api's we have today from the earliest
releases the Android view that animation
API is let you move scale and fade items
on screen this is available to every
device out there but it's pretty limited
here's a really simple example pressing
the button slides it up fades it out and
then shows a new screen and here's the
code first we create some objects like
alpha animation and translate animation
and combine them together using an
animation set then we add a listener
allowing us to run code when the
animation ends in this example when the
animation finishes we'll start another
activity we're also providing a custom
transition telling the new activity how
it should appear on the screen and
telling the current activity how it
should disappear once we call start
animation on the button it'll begin to
slide and fade and once those are done
our animation listener will get called
it's worth noting that you could also
define these animations in XML and
inflate them into real animation objects
using animation utils and here's what
the actual XML looks like back in the
early days the same XML format was used
to describe animations on views as well
as transitions for activities it was
really simple but also really limited
all you could really do is scale move
rotate and fade different views or
different activities so around the time
of android 3.0 and four-point-oh the
animation api is started receiving a
slew of major upgrades the API for basic
view animations got a lot simpler and
easier to use here's that same animation
from before with the new API notice how
the API uses a fluent interface you
could chain together multiple calls like
anime alpha translation why
this made for a much more compact code
more importantly you could also now
animate any property on any object so
while before you could animate the
exposition of a view you could now also
animate a buttons text color for example
so here's a quick example of this and
note that the a RGB evaluator tells the
object animator what text color to set
ranging between black and red over the
course of one second</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
