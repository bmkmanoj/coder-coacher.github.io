like to cover before we move into some
actual programming and this is acid now
again like many of the concepts on this
in this lecture this is a very very
broad topic and we're just barely going
to scratch the surface but I want you to
be familiar with these concepts because
this is the type of language we'll be
using when we're building our system so
acid this stands for a for atomicity C
for consistency I for isolation and D
for durability atomicity refers to the
notion that all parts of a transaction
succeed or fail together now we haven't
talked about transactions but these are
basically just a of a group of
statements so if we were updating our
database which is actually not something
we spent much time on there maybe the
case we're updating two tables at once
or updating multiple rows in our
database together you know in one
cohesive unit for example if we're
working from the reddit example if we
had a linked table in a user's table and
somebody up voted on a link and that
increases the users reputation we might
increase the score of the link and also
increase the reputation of the user and
those would happen in something that's
called a transaction which groups
together multiple commands atomicity
refers to the notion that either all of
those commands are going to succeed or
they're all going to fail but we don't
just we don't do part of it we don't
have just updating the link and not
updating the user
everything happens together so this is a
nice property for a database to have
consistency refers to the notion that
the database will always be consistent
and to work from our reddit example
let's let's talk about this idea where
we have a link in a user who have
properties if we have this notion that a
link has a has a has a score that gets
you know updated periodically and the
author or the submitter of that link
also has a karma score that also gets
updated at the same time consistency
refers to the notion that both the score
and the karma will be consistent with
one another so that we don't you know
update the score without also updating
the karma basically means the database
will move from one valid transaction to
the next so we'll never you know run a
query that gets a links updated score
but can't also get the users update
Kharma so isolation refers to the notion
that no transaction can interfere with
another's so let's say we have a link
that is both getting you know two votes
come in at the same time to increase the
score of of this link that means we're
going to be updating the link score up
and down and the users karma up and down
an isolation refers to the notion that
this this up vote won't affect the
computation of this down vote you know
if we were overriding this link in our
database it would be a shame if that the
down vote was applied to the original
link score before the up vote was
applied because the net score changing
here should be zero but it could be
negative one if these aren't handled
properly and so isolation refers to the
notion that each transaction cannot
affect other transactions sometimes this
is accomplished through locking if two
transactions affect the same row only
one can go at a time and there are other
ways of resolving transaction and
conflicts like that you know isolation
refers to a databases ability to do that
finally we have durability durability or
first the notion that once a transaction
is committed it won't be lost this means
that for example if we send an update to
our database and we update some rows and
the database says ok you know successful
that even if the database is turned off
or crashed crashes or is unplugged we
won't lose that data that is durability
one thing you know I'd like to know I
know is i know we introduced a lot of
new concepts in this in this portion
here but the important takeaway from
this is that when you're when you're
talking about different database systems
they have different trade-offs it's hard
to be fully having data base that's
completely atomic it's completely
consistent all transactions are isolated
and is completely durable there's always
some trade-offs</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
