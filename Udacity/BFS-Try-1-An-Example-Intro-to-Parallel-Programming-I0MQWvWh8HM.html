start here with node number two and
we're going to set the depth there equal
to zero and our goal is to find these
depths for each of these vertices
originally none of these are set we're
just going to say that's the value for
hasn't visited yet and we're going to
begin by setting vertex number two to
the value 0 so we know that the furthest
vertex away from node 2 is 2 hops away
so the maximum depth here is 2 and we
should expect that we should iterate
twice we're going to begin the algorithm
by looking at all of these edges in
parallel and what we're looking for is a
pattern where one of the vertices of
these edges is going to have a depth
value set and the other one does not and
we're going to find that 3 edges have
this particular quality so one of them
is going to be the edge between 1 and 2
we'll check and say ah the depth at
vertex 2 is 0 and vertex 1 has not been
visited yet so we'll set it equal to 0
plus 1 which is 1 we'll do the same
thing for this edge here between 2 &amp;amp; 3
okay we visited to its value as 0 we
haven't visited 3 so we set its value to
be 1 and this edge here 2 &amp;amp; 6
now we complete the first iteration we
visited every single edge and run 6
threads in parallel to make this
particular determination now we begin
our second iteration so now again what
we're looking for is an edge where the
vertex value of one end of the Edge has
been set and the other one has not yet
been visited so we're going to find
that's true for the other three edges so
the edge between 0 &amp;amp; 1 we find that the
depth at vertex number 1 is 1 we find
that vertex 0 has not yet been visited
so we set its depth to 1 plus 1 equals 2
and the same is going to be true for the
edges between 3 &amp;amp; 4 and the edge between
5 &amp;amp; 6
okay now we've filled in a value for all
of our vertices here and we're thus
complete</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
