a collection of test cases and so let's
be a little bit more rigorous about it
so it says coverage really is is a
measure of the proportion of a program
exercised during testing so for example
we just talked about measuring the
number of functions out of the total
number of functions they're exercised by
some test suite that we had what's good
about test coverage is it gives us a
score it gives us something objective
that we can use to try to figure out how
well we're doing additionally when
coverage is less than a hundred percent
that is to say is in our example where
we had failed to execute all of the
functions in the software under test we
know what we need to do to get full
coverage we know what the functions are
that we need to execute now we simply
need to construct test cases that
execute those functions so these are
good things about test coverage on the
other hand they're also some
disadvantages first of all test coverage
because it's a white box metric that's
derived from the source code for our
system is not good at helping us find
bugs of omission
that is to say bugs where we've simply
left out something that we should have
implemented the second drawback is it
could be really hard to know what a test
coverage score of less than 100% means
and in safety critical software
development what sometimes done is
requiring 100% test coverage over
certain coverage metrics and that sort
of removes this problem it means that we
don't have to interpret scores less than
100% because we're not allowed to ship a
product until we get 100% test coverage
for a larger more complex software
systems where the standards for
correctness are not as high as they are
for safety critical systems it's often
the case that it's difficult or
impossible to achieve 100% test coverage
leaving us with this problem of trying
to figure out what that actually means
about the software a third disadvantage
is even 100 percent coverage doesn't
mean that all bugs are found and you can
see that sort of easily by thinking
about the example where we were
measuring our coverage by looking at the
number of functions we executed just
because we executed some function of
course doesn't mean that we found all of
the bugs in that function we may not
have executed very much of it we may not
have somehow found very many of the
interesting behaviors inside that
function</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
