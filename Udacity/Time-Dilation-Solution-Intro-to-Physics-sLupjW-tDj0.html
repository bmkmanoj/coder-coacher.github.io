not moving the two frames are discussing
aren't moving at all the train is at
rest well we have one over the square
root of 1-0 which is one over one and it
turns out that that's the lowest
possible value that gamma can ever take
so that's gamma min forgive amex as we
get closer and closer to 1 as beta gets
closer and closer to 1 well 1 minus that
number squared this gets smaller and
smaller and as we divide by a smaller
and smaller number we get bigger and
bigger and it turns out that the maximum
value is as high as we would like and so
actually if we're going to plot this
value gamma versus beta what we defined
is that for a very long time gamma is
very close to 1 but then it quickly
Rises and gets bigger and bigger and
bigger as beta approaches 1 or as we
approach the speed of light what does
that mean means that this number gets
bigger means that the time measured on
the stationary observers clock gets
longer and longer when compared to the
moving observer this is why we call it
time dilation let's look at an example
to see if we can make some sense of this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
