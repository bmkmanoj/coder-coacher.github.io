problem starting with the definition of
the acceleration function we know that
the acceleration due to gravity points
downward so we can split this vector
into two components we have one
component right here that is parallel to
the string of the pendulum and another
component that is perpendicular to the
screen one now we know that the
acceleration in this direction is going
to be exactly canceled out by the
acceleration due to the tension in the
rope so that means that the acceleration
we're looking for is really just this
pink component which at any point along
the path is going to be tangent to the
trajectory now if we call this angle
theta right here we can figure out the
length of this pink component by just
saying that it is equal to the length of
the resultant vector times the sine of
theta a theta down here is actually
exactly equal to theta in the diagram of
the pendulum itself so that means to
figure out the length of this component
we can use information that we already
know about this larger diagram since
position is just the arc length right
here of this imaginary circle then the
measure of that angle in radians is
going to be equal to the length of the
arc that it corresponds to divided by
the radius of that circle that means
that in our case theta is equal to our
Klink over radius or position over
length so since theta equals position
over length and we want the sine of
theta we fill in our definition for
acceleration as negative G or negative
the magnitude the acceleration due to
gravity times sine of position over
length ok moving on to our symplectic
Euler function you had to fill in this
for loop with the input Nam initial
conditions as I said in the intro video
of the problem we wanted the initial X
to vary from 1 point 7 5 22.25 and the
initial V to vary from negative 2 to 2
corresponding to the coordinates of
every point along that green circle that
I showed you a convenient way to make a
variable cycle through values that are
symmetric about an equilibrium value is
to use sine or cosine so we're going to
keep that in mind now as you learn from
the circular orbit problem of unit one
if we consider any point along the
circumference of a circle then we can
define an angle that corresponds to that
point we start counting from right here
as is your radian work we can write the
coordinates of this point then as the
radius of the circle times the cosine of
the
that's for the horizontal component and
for the vertical component we get the
radius times the sine of the angle and
the phase space plot that I showed you
in the intro video we saw that position
lay along the horizontal axis and
velocity lay along the vertical axis so
we wanted to plot the coordinates of the
points on that green circle the initial
condition circle you know that position
is going to correspond to cosine and the
velocity is going to use sign now in our
code we created a variable called Phi
you could pick any name you want i guess
and phi effectively splits a circle in
249 segments by marking out 50 different
points along the circumference so every
time I increases by one we're going to
step to the next point along the
circumference since as you saw in a
phase space plot we had a complete
circle of green points the x values of
those green points very like this with
to as the middle value and the V
coordinates very like this you notice
that the amplitude in either case
corresponds to the half length of the
green shape in that direction so
actually what we had in the phase space
plot was an ellipse for that set of
initial conditions so now that we have
our starting conditions figured out we
can finally use a symplectic Euler
method to approximate the values of X
and V at later steps this code right
here is just a direct translation pretty
much of the equations that I showed you
earlier now let's go back to looking at
the plot that we get from this program
now first let's look at our top two
plots the horizontal axis in both of
them represents time measured in seconds
the vertical axis in the top one is x
measured in meters and here it is V
measured in needed for a second so we
can see that our initial values of x go
from 1 point 7 5 22.25 and v8 from
negative 2 to 2 so that corresponds to
this green ellipse right here it's the
most important thing to notice about
this bottom graph which like I said
earlier it represents phase space is
that if we look closely at each one of
these ellipses they all have the same
area now let's look at the shapes that
we have down here in this bottom graph
if you look closely and to a bit of
calculating you'll notice that all of
these different colored shapes have the
same exact area even though they're all
well shaped very differently this is a
great example of how phase space is
conserved in the system where energy is
conserved now the fact this conservation
principle holds in this diagram shows
how
electic Euler method improves upon the
accuracy of the forward Euler method
when the forward Euler method is used it
often results in the energy steadily
increasing so that would mean that the
area of each of these shapes down here
it would get progressively bigger
symplectic Euler method however conforms
much better the equations of motion of
physics and therefore reflects exact
theoretical predictions more accurately
great job of the first problem of unit
two</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
