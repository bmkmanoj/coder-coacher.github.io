between edges and nodes in a planar
graph we're going to use a result due to
Euler same Euler as before and to do
that we're going to need another concept
about planar graphs so here's a planar
graph on five nodes again we have a
notion of nodes we have a notion of
edges and we're also going to now talk
about a notion of regions in a planar
graph so regions are kind of areas that
are boxed off in the graph plus the
region outside of the graph turns out
that's a really useful thing to be able
to talk about so this particular graph
has three regions so we'll write it's
got five nodes six edges and three
regions now our good friend Euler
discovered a fascinating relationship
between these values that for any planar
graph n minus M plus R is equal to two
really so does that work in this case so
let's check this formula with the values
for this particular graph we've got n
minus M five minus six is negative one
plus three is indeed two interesting all
right we're gonna figure out why that is
in just a moment but let's let you
practice first understanding what these
regions are</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
