five today I only have programming
assignments while on smoothing and
run-on control and in both cases we're
trying to drive a car on a race track as
fast as we can okay
you've seen him in Nevada Mima this but
think of the car going on oval just like
that
so in this first exercise you're going
to go through a sequence of improvements
of the code smooth Torpy I am giving you
a path is very much a box path it's at
the zero zero cranks up the X dimension
all the way to six then increases the Y
all the way to three it goes down an X
all the way down to zero and then
reduces the Y all the way down to almost
zero if I draw this the way this looks
like we start at zero zero all the way
to six zero then we go up here to six
three then you go left to zero three and
down to zero one and this is a cyclic
course so we're smoothing before but for
an open path I'd now like you to modify
smoothing so I can smooth this path over
here so I want you to run the function
smooth with path as an input the weight
data of 0.1 and the smoothing parameter
0.1 and intolerance of 0.000001
and when you run it what it should
produce is a path like this the venue
plot it looks a little bit like an oval
you can look at these numbers carefully
it drags the corner points more into the
interior and I wanted to do it in a way
that is cyclic so that the last point
connects smoothly to the initial point
over here so please modify the code just
to be a cyclic smoother as opposed to
before it was in a certain order and
make it so each point gets uploaded we
don't keep two of the points fixed</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
