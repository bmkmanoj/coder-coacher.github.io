start putting them on stages they have
to have to play right alright song and
go into these records okay so here's the
band and the stage field is blank as is
set time yep and let's say we want play
they're in play what 10 a.m. at stage 4
stage ok ok so that it's good uh but
what if I actually wanted them to play
it two different set times like you know
want it 10 a.m. and maybe again at 11:00
or maybe he had a totally different
stage is there a way to do that it feels
like I would have to create an entirely
new band or something a new record
that's turning the relationship into
something a little bit more complicated
than just a simple one too many so let
me actually show you on the tablet what
I mean okay we're starting off with we
have our stage records and I'm only
representing it as one stage box but
this could be any of the stages that we
have and then each of these stages has a
specific time we can book them for so
like 10:00 a.m. 11 a.m. 12 p.m.
etc sure and then for each of these time
slots you could have any sort of band
playing there so let's say we had you
know our first band playing at 10 a.m.
but then for your second band you want
them playing at 11 and 12 okay yeah
you're right this isn't getting more
complicated as a data model so this is
clearly not how we would represent
something in Salesforce right instead of
now having a one-to-many relationship we
have a many-to-many relationship where a
stage can have many bands but bands can
be playing at multiple stages at many
times we're no longer tracking you know
what stage are the bands playing at but
it's more so what time are they playing
at those stages because now there's
another unique classification there so
we've added this sort of like
intermediate object exactly and what
we'd call that intermediate object in
Salesforce is a junction object and what
a junction object does is it represents
every unique instance that we relate a
band record to a stage record okay that
makes sense but what would this isn't
how we draw our schema in Salesforce so
what would this actually look like in
Salesforce right before we had just
stages and bands right and the
relationship had that little line with
the Three Forks at the end right our
stage had many bands but now we have
stages bands and this junction object
called set time okay how do you think
that this relationship will look when
mapping it out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
