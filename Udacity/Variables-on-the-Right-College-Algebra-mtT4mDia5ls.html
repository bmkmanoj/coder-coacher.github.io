factors are 57 and two so we can write
those in the first three slots right
here because of the commutativity of
multiplication it doesn't matter what
order we write the 57 and two in instead
I could have written to 75 or 25 7 or 7
52 or 7 25 or five to seven or any order
of these three numbers in these first
three slots for simplicity's sake I'm
just going to leave mine written this
way but your answer is right as long as
these three constant factors are in
these first three slots now what's left
over to deal with are the variable
factors so for those we have x y and z
here it's important to remember the
invisible multiplication signs between
these constant factors in the adjacent
variables remembering that those are
there is it's going to allow us to pull
out the variables and move them around
so I'm just going to keep x y&amp;amp;z in the
order they're written in and fill them
into the slots right here now just like
what the constant factors we could write
these variables in any order that we
want to you could write z YX ZX y X Y Z
actually that's what we have y XZ why is
the X any order these three variables go
in is correct as long as they are in
these last three slots</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
