of threats and we're asking you to order
these by the seriousness of the threat
for the question assume alice is
communicating with Bob using tor and
wants to keep this a secret Alice uses
the tour protocol to set up a circuit
between Onion Router 1 2 and 3 and uses
Onion Router 3 as the exit node to reach
Bob answer by listing the letter is in
order from the most severe threat to the
least severe for example DAC B which is
not the correct answer give you that one
for free do note that some of these are
subjective in multiple orders orderings
may be considered correct and here are
the six threats the first one an attack
in the middle intercepts the relay
extend requests between Onion Router two
and Onion Router 3 in attempts to set up
a different diffie-hellman key the
second threat a malicious attacker
controls the directory server from which
Alice learns the identity keys of Onion
Router 1 onion router to in Onion Router
3 and the third threat Alice's onion
proxy is compromised in the fourth
threat and eavesdropping attacker can
observe all network traffic and the
fifth fret Onion Router one and Onion
Router 3 are both controlled by the same
malicious attacker who has no other
access to the network in the final
threat Onion Router one in Onion Router
two are both controlled by the same
malicious attacker who has no other
access to the network order these
threats from the most severe to the
least severe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
