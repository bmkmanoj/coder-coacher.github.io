for DNS is vulnerabilities is a lack of
authentication the DNS SEC protocol adds
authentication to DNS responses simply
by adding signatures to the responses
that are returned for each DNS reply
when a stub resolver issues a query
assuming there is no caching the query
is relayed by the recursive resolver to
the root name server which as we know
sends a referral to calm but this
referral includes the signature by the
root of the IP address and the public
key of the dot-com server as long as
this resolver knows the public key
corresponding to the root it can check
the signature and it knows then that the
referral is to the correct IP address
for calm it also now knows the public
key corresponding to the dot-com server
thus when the dot-com server sends the
next referral to google com that
referral is signed by dot-coms private
key but the root has told the resolver
the public key corresponding takam and
thus the resolver can check that this
referral is not bogus and in fact came
from the dot-com server similarly the
dot-com server will return not only the
IP address for google com but also the
IP address and public key for the google
com authoritative name server so that
when Google returns its answers the
resolver can check the signature is
coming from google com in other words
each authoritative name server in the
DNS hierarchy returns not only the
referral as it would with regular DNS
but also a signature containing the IP
address for that referral and the public
key for the authoritative name server
that corresponds to that referral that
public key then allows the resolver to
check the signatures at the next lowest
level of the hierarchy until we finally
get to the answer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
