computing base isolation or tamper proof
was one of those requirements and that
we been talking about isolation and
memory protection all that is done to
get that tamper-proof requirement
untrusted code cannot be altering the
operating system data and code so that
was all to do with you know meeting one
of those requirements which is temporal
the other requirement is complete
mediation that you should not be able to
bypass the operating system and go
directly to a protected resource so how
do we implement complete mediation well
the way we do that is we make sure that
no protected resource whether it's a
memory page or a file could be accessed
without going through that trusted
computing base or the colonel okay so
this is the TCB is also the kernel the
way we do that is by making the trusted
computing base or having it act as a
reference monitor any time you have a
reference for a protected resource that
TCB has to come into the picture before
you can get to the resource okay the
reference has to be monitored by the
trusted computing base so there is no
way for should be no way for you to
bypass well one way you can get around
complete mediation is by web by passing
the trusted computing base there should
be no way for you to bypass this so how
is that implemented</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
