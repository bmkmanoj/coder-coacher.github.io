let's look on advanced search to see
what the individual attributes of a bug
report are up here you can see the
status of the problem is it a new
problem or is it a resolved problem if
it's a resolved problem you can look up
the resolution here was it fixed or is
it something that won't be fixed further
down you can see the version of Mozilla
that is affected by the problem as well
as the severity and the priority of the
problem what do these feels me let's
look at them in detail so what are all
these fields first there's severity
which describes the impact of the
problem on the user the most severe
problems are classified as a blockers or
showstoppers these are problems that
effectively halt all further development
then there's critical problems major
problems minor problems down to
enhancement requests enhancement
requests are issues a user would like to
see in some future version and which are
also stored in the problem database but
let's say that other problems are more
severe at this point priority defines
how soon the problem will be addressed
the problems with the highest priority
will be addressed first problems with
lower priority will be addressed later
the bug ID is a unique identifier or
number which allows you to precisely
identify a single problem comments are
left by developers adding additional
information about the bug or proposing
fixes on how to address the bug finally
notification these are the stakeholders
whoever is listed here will be notified
automatically whenever a problem gets a
new status</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
