hard work of defining all of those
procedures let's see the big payoff as
we use it to parse arbitrary strings in
arbitrary context-free grammars here
I've got the procedure add to chart that
you wrote any of the procedure closure
that you wrote once again defined using
list comprehension we've got shift which
either return something or nothing and
we've got reductions which has a
complicated returned based on J state in
the chart way at the top of this file
I've defined a particular grammar it's
that grammar of balanced parentheses
this is just our encoding of start
symbol goes to pee pee goes to open
parenthesis PP goes to nothing and then
down here I've got a candidate input
open open close close that's in the
language of the grammar so I desperately
hope that our procedure is going to find
that out down here i have the parsing
procedure skeleton that i wrote around
your code that does the heavy lifting so
one of the first things i do is take all
the input tokens and add in a special
end of input marker and that's because
sometimes we need to look ahead for
example for shifting to see if the input
token matches what's there and i don't
want us to walk off the end of a list so
I'm just sort of padding our data
structure by one here's the chart it
initially starts out totally empty it's
a Python dictionary with nothing in it
and our starting rule is just the first
rule in the grammar that's by total
convention we're going to start with s
goes to pee I pre initialize all of the
elements of the chart with the empty
list remember in that quiz I let you
assume that it would always be a
well-defined list so I'm making that
true here and then our start state just
works on this start rule it uses the
same symbol s there's nothing before the
red dot then we've got the red dot and
then we've got the P and that started in
state 0 and initially the only thing in
our chart is that at chart position 0 we
have this starting parsing state and
what we're going to do is be super lazy
and write ourselves a bunch of memos in
this chart over and over again we're
going to consider additional characters
in the input and keep using your three
procedures of closure shifting and
reduction until there aren't any more
change
so I is going to range over all of the
possible tokens and then until there are
no more changes we consider every state
in the chart in the state is something
like X goes to ABCD from Jay and I just
extract those into conveniently named
variables by pulling out the 0 1 2 and
third element of this tuple and now
we're going to go through three options
that correspond exactly to the work that
you did if the current state is ABCD we
could compute the closure if C is a non
terminal we look for each grammar rule C
goes to P Q R we make a next state blah
blah blah so here we're about to start
parsing a see but see maybe two maybe
something like expression with its own
production rules we want to bring those
in so here is the code that I promised
you in the quiz that i would write next
state is a call to closure you
implemented closure and then we check to
see if there are any changes in addition
to the closure there's also the
possibility that we're going to do
shifting ABCD and if the tokens are see
if the next token is C then we're
totally going to shift right so we're
looking for parse token c and the
current token is exactly see if that
happens we are super lucky we can parse
over it and move on to j plus 1 so
here's the code that I promised you in
the quiz i would add and there it is
finally there's our third option for
computing reductions this one is the
most complicated if CD is empty then we
go back in time to chart J and bring
something from it forward to this
current location you just finished
implementing that and down here we have
the code that I've promised I would
include in the parser that calls your
function reductions and then we're just
going to keep repeating this until
nothing changes remember that this was
in a wild true loop so we're going to
loop over and over and over again until
there are no changes and then we break
out of the loop down here I have some
purely debugging information this is all
just to print out the chart at the end
so that we can take a look at it we
wouldn't actually need this if we were
doing a parser this is for explanatory
purposes only and then down here I've
defined the accepting state we reasoned
to this earlier which is the basically
the starting
but with everything to the left of the
red dot and nothing to the right of it
coming from state 0 if the accepting
state is in the chart in position T when
there are T tokens then we parse the
string successfully otherwise we do not
so down here I'm checking to see what
this value is is this string in the
language of the grammar or not and we
just print that out and in this
particular example the string is in the
language of the grammar so hopefully
that's what we'll see well our output is
quite voluminous we see chart position 0
doot-doot-doot chart position one chart
position two in fact this was our
starting state s goes to dot P from zero
and then we brought in these other two
from the closure good quiz question to
ask yourself is why do we have this one
s goes to p dot from zero and my hint is
remember that p can go to nothing so
actually the empty string is accepted by
this grammar but we end up filling in 0
1 2 3 4 this one actually corresponds to
you know look ahead that sort of end of
input symbol that we saw there and
eventually we discover that wow our
string is in the language of this
grammar we're so happy this is exactly
what we wanted now if I were to change
this a bit I've been very minor lee
devious and now instead of having
balanced parentheses i have three open
followed by one close so now I've
changed it so that the string shouldn't
be in the language of the grammar we
have three opens followed by one closed
I click run the chart is actually going
to be very similar at the beginning
changing only near the end possibly a
little bit but now we report that the
string is not in the language of the
grammar as expected</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
