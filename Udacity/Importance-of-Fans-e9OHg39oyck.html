game easy to play and very engaging but
the best games also need to reach as
many people as possible for example our
game where we bounce a ball through a
ring of fire is obviously brilliant but
it's so new that no one knows about it
yet and you can't get someone interested
in your game if they haven't heard of it
you need fans so what makes a player a
fan fans of players that help spread the
word about your game by telling their
friends about it and then those friends
tell their friends and on and on and how
can we get fans like that well word of
mouth is one simple way to grow your fan
base many developers also do outreach on
social media to reach a wider audience
but they keep their fans by creating
ways for them to influence the content
of that very game and improve it and by
making your game better and promoting it
fans can help your game make money</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
