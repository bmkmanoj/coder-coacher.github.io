let's do that by taking all of these
vertices that have k plus 1 edges or
more and actually putting them in the
cover and that's because we already said
it has to be in the cover now what we
can do is actually remove these vertices
from the graph and any edges connected
to them because those edges are
automatically covered so we don't have
to worry about them anymore so we are
automatically dealing with a much
smaller graph or potentially much
smaller graph what this tells us is that
after removing these vertices each
remaining vertex can cover at most a
certain number of edges if it's put in
the cover and this could either be K
minus 1 k k plus 1 2 K or K squared
edges what this would then mean is that
the remaining graph can have no more
than a certain number of edges if G is a
yes instance of the vertex cover
decision problem which is the original
assumption that we made and this can
either be K minus 1 k k plus 1 2 K or K
squared so please check whichever are
appropriate for both these questions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
