time actually sorry that's not the
question finding the time is easy we
just look at the Sun the real question
is how can I keep the time for my local
Harbor when I go to say let's see what I
need is periodicity I need something
that happens at regular intervals for
example we're all familiar with the
ticking of a clock and that seems like
an obvious solution but clocks are
difficult to make what else could we use
that has a regular periodic nature to it
one attempted solution to this problem
of finding something periodic that we
could use as a timekeeper came from our
good friend Galileo standing as he
always does next to the leaning tower of
pizza now Galileo had invented some
incredible telescopes with these
telescopes he was able to observe the
ring around the planet Saturn mountains
on the moon dark spots on the Sun and
the planet Jupiter and it's four moons
each of which orbited around in a
predictable fashion now of the four
discoveries Galileo made with his
telescope which do you think could
somehow be used for keeping time at sea</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
