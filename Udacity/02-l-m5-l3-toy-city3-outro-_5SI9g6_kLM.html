would be proud of the progress you've
made on this prototype there's one last
request though she wants to see two new
features she doesn't want to hold you
back just create whatever you think
would add the most value to this
application then after making sure that
your code quality is up to snuff and
that your code runs is expected your
boss and the Udacity code reviewers want
to know what you learned during this
process in your project repository we
want you to create a perfection style
and write about your experiences working
on this I want you to answer the
following questions how long did you
spend working on this project what was
the most rewarding challenge you
conquered what new features did you
build and why and where do you still
have room for growth lastly take a step
back and look at what you've just
created and compare this to toy City one
when we feel like there's still a long
way to go before you're making web apps
but just look how far you've come keep
this momentum up and way to go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
