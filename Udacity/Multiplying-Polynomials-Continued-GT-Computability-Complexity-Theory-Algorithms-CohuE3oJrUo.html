exercise some more cleverness will be
needed to make this process efficient
even the evaluation of polynomials that
arbitrary points will take quadratic
time for each point we need to do a
number of multiplications and additions
that is proportional to the number of
coefficients the most efficient way to
do this is via Horner's rule you can
find the link in the instructors notes
you can also think about filling out the
vandermonde matrix and then doing the
matrix multiplication regardless for
arbitrary points we end up with a
quadratic running time multiplying in
the value domain takes order n plus n
time since we just multiply the values
for the corresponding inputs XJ this
part is fine interpolation involves
solving the system of equations with n
plus M equations and n plus M unknowns
by Gaussian elimination this would take
order n plus M Q time in the worst case
for vandervon matrices however there's
also a method called the garage
interpolation that allows us to do this
in time this just quadratic note however
that this still isn't good enough
in fact we're at essentially the same
running time as we have for convolution
is there any hope well yes there is all
of these running times pertain to an
arbitrary set of values for X here but
since we're only interested in the
coefficients of the product polynomial C
we get to choose all these X and as it
turns out this freedom is very very
powerful</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
