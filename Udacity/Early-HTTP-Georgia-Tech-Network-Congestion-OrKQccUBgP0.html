had one request a response for every TCP
connection on the plus side this is
simple to implement but the main
drawback is that it requires a TCP
connection for every request thereby
introducing a lot of overhead and
slowing transfer first of all we need a
TCP 3-way handshake for every request
and TCP must start in slow start
every time the connection opens this is
exacerbated by the fact that short
transfers are very bad for TCP because
TCP is always stuck in slow start and
never gets a chance to actually ramp up
to steady-state transfer also as TCP
connections are terminated after every
request is completed the servers have
many connections that are forced to keep
TCP connections in time wait States
until the timer's expire thus resulting
in additional resources that the server
needs to keep reserved even after the
connections have completed so a solution
to increase efficiency and account from
any of these drawbacks is to use
something called persistent connections</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
