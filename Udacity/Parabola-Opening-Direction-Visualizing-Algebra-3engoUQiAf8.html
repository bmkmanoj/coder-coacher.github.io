great thinking if you got that one right
one of the key things to recognize is
that this equation is in the form x
equals parabolas that are in this form
either open to the left or to the right
since the a value is negative 1 we know
the parabola will open to the left if I
had a different parabola like x equals 3
y squared then we can see that that
parabola opens to the right since the a
value here is positive let's take this
one away for a moment and just
concentrate on the first parabola again
its vertex is at 0 0 this is the turning
point for the parabola notice also that
there's an axis of symmetry that goes
through the vertex it means that if
there's a point on this side of the
graph then directly across from it is
another point for example we know the
point negative 4 comma 2 is on the graph
so we could also know that the point
negative 4 negative 2 is also on the
graph if we zoom in on our parabola we
can also find other points by moving
from the vertex
since our parabola is in the form x
equals this time we'll move up and down
1 unit next we'll move a units in the x
direction to find the two points so a is
negative 1 so I can go one unit up and
one unit left this gives me the point
negative 1 comma 1 and if I want to find
another point I can move one unit down
and one unit left to get this point
negative 1 negative 1 let's also see
this with this graph x equals 3 y
squared if we zoom in on this purple
parabola we can see how to get these
points of 3 1 and 3 negative 1 we start
at the vertex and we go one unit up and
one unit down since we're in the form x
equals and this time we're gonna go
three units right since the a value is
positive 3 so we'll go one unit up and
three units right one unit down and
three units right this gives us the
other two points on our parabola</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
