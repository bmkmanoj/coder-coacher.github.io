smaller than 10 that means that running
time will be around a thousand time
units or 1024 time units to be precise
if its twenty you will have about a
million time units if it's 30 you will
have about 1,000,000,000 time units so
1000 times 1000 times 1000 if its larger
than 100 then of course you have a huge
running time here you will have a
running time that is about 10 to the
power of 30 so it's clear that when your
instances get larger than 100 you would
not be able to use brute force and on
the other hand if you just need 1,000
time units I think you don't even care
if you have one instance to solve 100 or
10,000 because if you think about it a
current desktop computer is running on
gigahertz so it can perform several
billion operations per second so even
solving 10,000 instances where each one
is small is usually not an issue unless
you're working in very special
environments what about a million time
units I would clearly say well solving
that once is okay again your computer
can perform several billion operations
per second solving 100 instances is
usually ok and even solving 10,000
instances so 10,000 times 1,000,000
that's 10 billion which sounds like a
lot but actually again desktop computers
can handle this in most cases now what
about this case here well 1 billion is
ok we just said that over here and we
said even 10 billion was a case so what
about a hundred billion well this I
think here is kind of debatable but I
would still say it's worth a try
probably then you have to probably wait
for two or three or four days until all
instances are solved or maybe even one
month but in most cases that should be
ok you wouldn't even attempt to solve an
np-complete problem in real time for
example this one here I think is the
most debatable so ten thousand billion i
would say in a general case you wouldn't
want to do that i mean there might be
special cases if you work for the Secret
Service and you have a huge cluster of
computers available but here you're kind
of reaching the limits of brute force
and here of course as we just said
you've already reached them so again
brute force can work if the instances
are small or maybe even moderate
but this approach is bound to fail at
some point and that's when to apply
intelligence instead of brute force
using intelligent force</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
