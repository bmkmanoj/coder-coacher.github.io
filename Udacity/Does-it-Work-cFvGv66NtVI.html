think it's worth asking whether or not
it actually works does it work well it's
complicated mmm tell me more there have
been some examples where things worked
out extremely well so let me just
quickly summarize some of them so you
have a sense you mentioned neural
networks so neural networks including
with nonlinear connections have been
used with back propagation in this
context folks like Jerry tesaro and Tom
Dietrich have gotten some very nice
results creating learning systems that
can actually do some fairly complicated
things in some difficult tasks like what
well so Jerry tessaro's work was in
backgammon and he actually used the same
kind of approach in jeopardy in the
Watson system for figuring out how to do
decision-making what you know what's
what's the right strategy for handling
different situations in jeopardy and the
value function was being predicted using
a back prop net in Wang Dietrich's work
they were actually predicting the
likelihood of success of various sort of
shuttle strategy shuttle scheduling
strategy so they're actually doing for
NASA shuttle scheduling strategies say
that three times though she sells
seashells to the shuttling scheduling
system sure so those worked out really
well that being said there's not that
many other people who've gotten that to
work effectively I certainly whenever I
say to my students look these things
work so well why don't you try it they
don't seem to be nearly as successful as
these folks have been I got it to work
for my master's thesis did you really
for what problem for a tic tac toe and
then for a vision problem that after I
went through all this trouble I realized
was just learning round oh that's
impressive in quote I was impressive
enough to give me a master's thesis
which I think was the important thing so
maybe the impressive things that I got a
master's thesis at MIT of all places of
all places so it does sometimes work I
find that it's kind of difficult to get
it to work consistently what happens
often when my students try this is they
get a system that actually tends to
start to learn well and then it goes
into some kind of a death spiral because
as I mentioned before the bootstrapping
aspect of this means that you're really
dependent on making solid predictions
based on your previous predictions and
when they start to go south the whole
and can fall apart actually really
quickly that being said there are some
other function approximate age that
actually have been more successful that
are variations of linear function
approximator so so rich Sutton in
particular has gotten CMAC to work on a
whole bunch of tough problems cmax are
CMAC it's a it's a particular kind of
function representation that is like a
neural net except for that first layer
isn't really learned it's kind of
decided in advance how you're going to
break up the input space and so it
really is kind of just a generalization
of straight up linear these are these
can be really effective but they don't
generalize very aggressively and that's
part of what makes them a bit safer to
use in this setting</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
