haven't been written in any particular
order remember what we learned before
about the commutative property of
addition changing the order that you add
terms together in has no effect on the
value of the expression a plus B is just
equal to B plus a so any set of terms
that you have added together can be
written together in any order and will
still be mathematically correct
regardless of which of those orders you
choose to use however there is a
convention that people use in algebra to
help them figure out what order to write
the terms of a polynomial in it's pretty
simple the tendency is to write terms
from highest degree to lowest degree so
for example if we have this polynomial y
plus 6x y minus y cubed we can first
figure out the degree of each term and
then rearrange these terms so that the
term with the highest degree comes first
and then the rest of the terms continue
in descending order of degree a
polynomial written in this way is set to
be written in standard form so again
writing a polynomial in standard form
doesn't make it any more mathematically
correct than writing the terms in any
other order but mathematicians usually
find the standard form a bit more
visually appealing and it also can help
us understand the polynomial as a whole
a bit more quickly than we could if we
wrote the terms in a different order
since in standard form the term with the
highest degree comes first we only need
to look at that first term to figure out
what the degree of the entire polynomial
is so that's why standard form is
particularly convenient</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
