conversation what have we learned all
right well we talked about ensemble
learning which was the idea of instead
of just learning one thing if it's good
to learn once it's even better to learn
multiple times and multiple ways the
simple version that we concentrated on
first was this notion of bagging where
what we did is instead of just learning
on the whole data set we would subsample
bunch of examples from the training set
different ways and train up different
classifiers or different learners on
each of those and then merge them
together with the average okay so if I
can summarize that we learned that
ensembles are good we learned that even
simple ensembles like bagging are good
we talked about the fact that by using
this kind of ensemble approach you can
take simple learners or simple
classifiers and merge them together and
get more complicated classifiers yeah so
we can take simply can combining simple
gives you complex anything else and we
talked about the idea of boosting where
you can oh maybe this is why it's called
boosting you can take something that has
possibly very high error but always less
than 1/2 and turn it into something that
has very low error so we learned that
boosting is really good and we talked a
little bit about why that's good by the
way there's a whole bunch of other
details here too right boosting also has
the event as does bagging not only has
these little properties you talked about
before but that tends to be very fast
it's agnostic to the learner did you
notice that at no time did we say try to
take advantage of what the actual
learner was doing just that it was in
fact a weak learner so I think that's
important
it's agnostic meaning you can plug in
any learner you want yeah so long as
it's a weak learner so there's something
we learned about we learned about weak
learners did we define what that meant
and we also talked about what error
really really means with respect to some
kind of underlying distribution what do
you think Michael that seems like useful
stuff these are useful stuff to me I'm
gonna throw one more thing at you
Michael before I let you go ok you ready
yep here's a simple fact about boosting
that turns out in practice you know our
favorite little overfitting example
remember fitting works you
have a training line that tends to get
better and better and better maybe even
going down to zero error but then you
have test error which gets better and
better and better and then at some point
starts to get worse and at that point
you have overfitting and I think Michael
you asserted at some point or maybe I
asserted that you always have to worry
about overfitting overfitting is just a
kind of fact of life you got to come up
with ways to deal with it sort of over
believing your data well what if I told
you that in practice when you run
boosting even as you run it over time so
that your training error keeps getting
better and better and better and better
it also turns out that you're testing
error keeps getting better and better
and better and better and better and
better and better that seems too good to
be true it does seem too good to be true
it turns out it's not too good to be
true and I have an explanation for it
tell me not until next time all right
see you then see you then bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
