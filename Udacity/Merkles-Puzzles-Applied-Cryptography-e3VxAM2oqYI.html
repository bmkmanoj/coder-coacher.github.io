is an idea that Ralph Merkle came up
with in 1974 it's not a practical idea
at all but it's a really clever idea and
I think it's a fun thing to talk about
before we get into the more realistic
solutions that are used today so the
idea behind Merkel's puzzles is that you
have the two parties that want to share
a key and we'll call them Alice and Bob
as usual first they have to agree on
some parameters they agree on an
encryption function they agree on
security parameters s N and uppercase n
so the basic idea is alice is going to
create many puzzles send them to Bob Bob
will randomly pick one of the puzzles to
solve and part of solving that puzzle
will give Bob the number of the puzzle
and a secret and what he'll send back to
Alice is the number of the puzzle and
Alice will know the corresponding secret
and they'll use that as the key so let
me go through this in a little more
detail but that's the high-level idea
and the reason that this gives you a way
to establish a key is because Bob's
randomly picking one puzzle to solve
where as an attacker would have to solve
many puzzles before they could get the
one that Bob actually solved
so here's how the steps work and a
little more detail so in order to create
puzzles so Alice creates a list of n
secrets each one of these is a random
number as bits long then she creates a
set of messages also n messages and each
message will be encrypted using the
encryption function that they agreed on
using a key that the corresponding
secret concatenated with enough zeros to
make the appropriate key length so if
this was a 128-bit AES key the secret
size might be say 40 bits and then we
would add zeros to fill out the rest of
the key and then what will encrypt using
that key is a message that says gives
the identity of the puzzle which will be
that index and the message will give the
identity of the puzzle and will include
a string before it so it's clear that
that's the right message if we just
included a number if there were enough
numbers we might accidentally decrypt
one to that so that's what we encode for
each message here after this Alice
shuffles the messages and then she sends
all n mess
to Bob Bob ranley picks one of those
then does a brute-force key search where
Bob is trying to decrypt using a guest
key concatenated with n minus s zeroes
the message that Bob randomly selected
from those puzzles eventually he's gonna
find one of these D Crips two puzzle
followed by a number at this point Bob
knows the guests so he knows the secret
that was used for that and he knows the
puzzle number if we wanted a larger key
which we probably do what we should
include in the puzzle instead of just
the AI we should include a key and this
means the key can be of any length this
would be some new random key associated
with that puzzle Alice would keep track
of those keys and so for each puzzle
when Bob decrypt set he acquires both
the puzzle number and the key number
sends the number of the puzzle back to
Alice Alice can look up in her keys
figure out which key was the one in the
puzzle Bob decrypted so assuming
encryption and the random number
generation worked perfectly the question
is how much more work doesn't
eavesdropper have to do then Bob has to
do and an eavesdropper hears all the
messages between Alice and Bob wants to
determine the key that they'll use to
communicate
so here the choices it's impossible for
the attacker to find the key the
attacker would need to use end times as
much work as Bob to determine the key
the attacker would expect to need n over
two times as much work as Bob or the
attacker would be expected to need twice
as much work as Bob and the value of n
is the number of puzzles that Alice
creates and sends to Bob</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
