example Pavlov was a neutral stimulus so
a neutral stimulus is a stimulus that
originally produces no specific response
other than perhaps an orienting response
meaning the dog looked at Pavlov next we
see that Pavlov repeatedly paired his
sight with the meat powder
thus the meat powder was an
unconditioned stimulus remember an
unconditioned stimulus is a stimulus
that automatically causes a reflex to
occur the meat powder caused the dog to
salivate here the salivation is an
unconditioned response remember an
unconditioned response is something that
occurs automatically in the presence of
a particular stimulus now remember in
the beginning Pavlov was repeatedly
paired with the meat powder then when he
came by himself and did not give meat
powder so Pavlov became a conditioned
stimulus a conditioned stimulus is a
previously neutral stimulus that comes
to elicit a response due to its pairing
with an unconditioned stimulus so when
pal have approached the dog as a
conditioned stimulus it caused a
conditioned response in the conditioned
response is one that occurs in the
presence of a conditioned stimulus
presented alone so here the sight of
Pavlov was a conditioned stimulus the
salivation was the conditioned response</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
