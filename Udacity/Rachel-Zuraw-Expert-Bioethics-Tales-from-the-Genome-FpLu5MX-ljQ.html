Francisco I'm an attorney specializing
in intellectual property especially
pharmaceutical and biotechnology with a
background in bioethics great well we're
very happy you're here we have just
learned a little bit about Henrietta
Lacks and what we learn in the story of
henrietta lacks is her non-consensual
contribution to science and over the
years how her cells were used for many
great medical advances and her family as
ultimately really hasn't been
compensated in any way financially but
has recently there have been a couple of
things that have happened where NIH has
put family members on a committee to
help them decide how the genome of HeLa
cells is going to be used who gets the
information very recently yeah very very
recently what I wanted to talk to you
first about was really just actually um
you know what are the ethical issues
surrounding the use of specifically hela
cells in the case of Henrietta's story
but also the the issue of using tissues
from people without their consent in
general well that's a big question you
know what are the ethical issues with
this because it has to be couched in a
way in a long history of failing to seek
consent from people who in voluntarily
participated in medical research like
Henrietta Lacks it's one of the
fascinating things about the Henrietta
Lacks story and the HeLa cells is the
ability to identify an individual who
participate in research without her
consent most of the time these sort of
looking back at people who accidentally
moved research forward inadvertently not
voluntarily that's groups of people who
were in many ways taken advantage of by
the medical establishment the
researchers who took the cells from
hinder Etta's you've already covered you
know they were attempting there were
multiple attempts to find the
Immortal cell line and they were taking
samples from anyone they could she was
there for therapeutic treatment when
they took the cell line and at the time
that the cells were harvested from
Henrietta Lacks there were not the
informed consent guidelines weren't in
place requiring well how in depth should
i get to informed consent um well you're
gonna try I'll stop you ok so the
Nuremberg trials of the Nazi physicians
who participated in medical experiments
well Kwazii medical experiments in the
concentration camps the one of the first
principles to come out of the Nuremberg
is that the voluntary consent of a human
research subject is absolutely essential
and that's been embroidered on in United
States law and ethical guidelines ever
since the informed consent the any
individual participating in research
needs to be told beforehand they need to
have all of the information that they
are able to understand so that they can
agree or not to participate in the
research it must be fully voluntary it
must be fully voluntary fully informed
and fully voluntary you can't make a
voluntary choice to participate if you
don't have all of the information now
you mentioned the Nuremberg trials yes
which happened I believe in the 1940s
yes but the hearing alack story happened
and I think 1951 mm-hmm so was there
anything extra compounding the issue
with Henrietta Lacks that um maybe
hadn't caught up yet with informed
consent in the United States informed
consent in the United States in the
early 1950s was still a good theory you
know everyone thought that this this
sounded like a great idea but then you
have an uneducated patient in the
hospital who doesn't understand what
treatment she's received
is not advocating for herself and in the
concept of the time in the context of
the time most physicians would not have
paused to think I should explain to her
why I'm taking this tissue sample and
let her know what I'm going to do with
it today we can discuss some other
examples that sort of behavior still
goes on but it's recognized by the
medical establishment to be an actual
intrusion and invasion of the patient's
autonomy of the human research subjects
autonomy no for people who are hearing
about the story for the first time it
may be important for us to sort of
briefly discuss the idea that you know
to use the phrase maybe she was a victim
of the sort of contemporary climate and
culture that she was and may or may not
be true i mean i guess when I what I
want to have you speak to is there was
nothing specifically malicious done
against henrietta lacks nothing it's
more along the idea that there was a
right that we recognize now that was
violated at that time that happened
exactly now that's that's one of the
trickiest things about the Henrietta
Lacks story I agree is that at the time
when the HeLa cell line was first
harvested there was no recognized duty
to tell a patient that you had taken
some of their genetic or cellular
material for research the researcher who
took the material wasn't even intending
to profit off of it he may have had he
may have felt he probably would not have
realistically felt any obligations tell
her if he intended to market and profit
off of tequila cell line which he did
not but his intentions were pure in his
mind he was trying to advance the
scientific cause and there was no
recognized obligation to the
participants in a study to inform them
of their participation right now
obviously things have changed since then
and incrementally okay in leaps and
bounds maybe not as much as we would
have liked
I want you to speak to that for a second
that I mean did the Henrietta Lacks Tory
change anything if not at the time
eventually and if not that were there
are other cases that you know had a
bigger impact on how we look at informed
consent well the Henrietta Lacks stories
you know it wasn't known for more than
40 years so when the immortal life of
henrietta lacks was released when
rebecca skloot started publicizing this
story then i think the story has now
become part of a really interesting
movement towards control over personal
genetic information which I think we're
really just seeing the beginnings of
because legally there was never a
recognized right of ownership or control
of your well in the past tissues blood
sample etc before genetic information
could be extracted and used from those
samples but now you know Henrietta Lacks
you mentioned that her descendants are
now sitting on a committee to authorize
the use of the genetic information
gleaned from the HeLa cells likewise
there was a really interesting decision
in 2010 regarding a small Indian tribe
that lives in the Grand Canyon who hid
given blood samples to university of
arizona researcher for to be used in
diabetes and schizophrenia research one
of the members of the tribe found out
several years after these blood samples
were donated that they were being used
for purposes that the tribe members had
not consented to the University of
Arizona of course argued that this was
perfectly acceptable they had the
samples they had no right of ownership
to the samples however the ultimate
outcome of this case is that the tribe
was able to dictate that they would not
authorize their blood samples to be used
for anything other than the original
intended purpose and actually all of the
samples that they donated were destroyed
so I mean these are just a couple of
isolated examples
case by case situation is not really
setting the precedent for how we're
going to be managing genetic information
that are that is in hands of researchers
but it's indicative of an interesting
movement towards people becoming aware
of and taking measures to control the
use of their genetic information now in
that same vein I feel like I've heard
and maybe you're correct me if I'm wrong
if you know is it true that if I have
discarded a piece of my tissue or myself
if I have left skin cells behind if I
have left bits of me you know a hair
follicle with the root attached
somewhere and someone finds it are they
free to use that sample however they see
fit if it's been discarded from my body
at this time there'd be nothing to stop
them now is that a hotly debated issue
discard a genetic tissue it's being
debated I wouldn't call it one of the
biggest issues in bioethics at the
moment but it's certainly out there and
I think it's going to become more and
more of an issue as well I mean it's a
two-fold thing right as both science
advances such that we can do more with a
discarded hair follicle and as
individuals and society non-scientists
become aware of what can be done with a
discarded hair follicle then I think
you're going to see a lot more
legislation aimed at aimed at preventing
those uses I mean we're going to talk
about Gina in a bed genetic information
non-discrimination Act which you know
that was sparked back in 1995 before
there was a very real possibility of
workplaces or insurers discriminating
against people based on what could be
uncovered in their genome but science
was getting there and people started to
worry mhmmm yeah sure I mean it often it
seems like we rarely get ahead of the
curve on these things that's one of
those where where they were I want to
ask one more question more specifically
about the Henrietta Lacks story
there are people who claim that she I'm
sorry I should say I'm there are people
who claim that the Lacks family
Henrietta Lacks family her descendants
Henrietta Lacks is deceased but that her
family deserves some sort of the
financial benefit that has occurred from
the use of her cells not so much morally
speaking but legally speaking when a
tissue or a sample from an individual
has been taken in a way that we would
consider unethically or illegally today
but maybe not at the time what are the
ideas surrounding financial compensation
in that sense I mean is there any
validity to those kinds of arguments or
is that just more of people are doing
from a moral standpoint that is a moral
standpoint the commercial rights to your
tissue once it has been separated from
your body are for better or worse pretty
much zilch one of the first cases on the
area was the Regency united states of
California vs. more decades ago but in
that particular case more the patient
was going down to UCLA for treatment for
hairy cell leukemia his physicians said
that they needed to remove his spleen
for therapeutic treatments they actually
intended without disclosing it to him to
isolate material from his spleen and
from his blood samples to create a
highly profitable cell line and for
years actually they kept him coming down
he lived in don't remember if it was
Washington and I think they kept him
coming down for visits that they said
were therapeutic for the treatment of
his leukemia but they were actually
harvesting samples for use in developing
a cell line that i think was valued
about three million dollars once he
found out he sued trying to you know get
a share of this not
rationally one would think right but the
courts ruled that he had that the
doctors of course violated some rather
important duties of disclosure towards
him that they should have like the
guidelines of the American Medical
Association their ethical guidelines
require that physicians disclose if they
have any commercial interest he said
they physicians violated some duties of
care in that vein of not disclosing
their commercial interest in his
materials but that he had no right to
any of the profits derived from his
cellular material and there's actually a
line of cases on that same principle and
this is actually a really interesting
debate in intellectual property and in
bioethics about whether whether giving
individuals any kind of commercial right
to their bodily materials and the
products derived therefrom a lot of
opponents are doing that say that it
would have a drastic chilling effect on
research that if you know physician
researchers were always going to be
beholden to the individuals who
hopefully uh knowingly donated their
material to the research then the
physician researchers wouldn't bother to
do the research in the first place to
explore commercial possibilities I don't
know whether or not that's true I like
to leave a little more in altruism than
perhaps that debate presupposes sure but
fantasy world who knows anyway that it's
just a really interesting debate going
back and forth about whether or not to
allow this kind of commercial interest
and also whether to allow whether to
allow control over the use of tissues
and now over genetic material there have
been a number of fights about whether or
not for example a physician who has
collected a number of
two samples for his research while at
one University can take those tissue
samples with him to his next University
and you know what study is those can be
used for end do you legally need legally
you probably don't need the consent of
the donors ethically fun question yeah
that does a fun question well so let
that sort of brings us to to a new point
that I mean we we've changed in the last
fifteen hundred years we do have these
new rules of at least informed consent
voluntary informed consent and there
seems to be a new worry as you mentioned
a second ago in 1995 there was a big
concern about the power personal
genetics and what it would be used for
why are people so worried about genetic
discrimination what is the biggest worry
that people normally site and say this
is scary we need to do something about
this this is a moral imperative what is
what is behind that aside from the movie
gattaca which i think is behind a lot of
it it's very scary movie it is you seen
it lately gina was conceived of and
passed because people people are very
concerned that opportunities will be for
stalled based on a possibility of some
genetic issue that could befall them
later on in life that they're being you
know prejudged pre penalized based on
something that might not happen it seems
very like antithetical to the Western
philosophical idea of individualism and
free will exactly I mean it's I you can
understand you know from a gut level why
of course it's terrifying to think like
you know why are you why won't you hire
me why are you charging me all this
extra money to get health insurance just
because someone in my family had a
health problem that will probably never
affect
you know it seems unfair which is you
know very high-minded ethical and legal
concept what so Gina or the Genetic
Information non-discrimination Act was
passed in 1995 and what did it do gina
was actually signed into law in 2008 it
was a very long process so it the fight
to create Gina first began in 1995 you
know a bunch of the bills that
eventually became Gina started
circulating through the government back
in 95 and probably being talked of even
earlier and so sorry here no I was gonna
ask what did what did Gina do what what
did it say what what was what was the
the legal meaning behind it well Gina's
general goal is to prevent
discrimination by employers with 15 or
more employees or by insurers based on
an individual's genetic information or
family medical history so they included
family medical history in part because
you know not everyone has had their
genome sequenced but the idea is there
are a lot of this breaks down into a lot
of different provisions of course a lot
of different individual granular
protections that the insurer cannot
raise premiums based on the fact that
say my aunt had breast cancer I may or
may not carry one of the Baraka gene
variants that would increase my likely
risk of receiving breast cancer I cannot
be charged under Gina a higher premium
for that likewise your insurer or your
employer cannot require that you undergo
any type of genetic testing to assess
your risk for developing any condition
your it permits of course in health a
health care provider to recommend
testing for various purposes but even
then an insurer or an employer can only
collect the bare minimum of information
that they need to have for coverage
decisions basically they cannot collect
and store additional information
regarding your genetic makeup
predispositions whatever we're going to
call it are there ways around them how
do you mean I'm just wondering you know
so legally I can't raise your premium
because you have the bracket one
mutation but could I raise your premium
for some other reason I mean do are
there any examples of workarounds where
people do end up discriminating based on
these based on personal genetic
information anyhow or is it just is it
not even something people really even
try or think about doing so far it
really hasn't been an issue I think it's
I think one of the reasons is because a
lot of the early thought in you know
some of the predecessor bills to gina
was okay sure you can't make someone
take a genetic test and discriminate
against them on that basis but you can
take down their family medical history
and discriminate against them on that
basis which of course you know
principles of genetic inheritance so
that's why that got folded into Gina in
the first place I'm not aware of any
successful workarounds actually that
anyone has tried yet perhaps that's
because it's a ironclad law such a great
piece of legislation or more likely the
challenges haven't made it into the
court said I could go at either of those
do you feel the concern about genetic
discrimination is valid absolutely I
mean you can all too easily imagine an
employer yeah saying you know let's
let's not say breast cancer
has a you know they've had their genome
they've had their genome coded and they
show a likelihood it shows that you know
they will almost certainly develop
Huntington's say and an employer who
wants to make a long-term investment an
employee if they have access to that
information they're allowed to make
decisions based on it might say you know
we'd really rather have some what will
have a longer working life with us
likewise and ensure i mean insurers make
their money based on having the maximum
number of basically healthy people
paying into the insurance pool which
then right goes to pay for the less
healthy people it is in the insurer's
best interest to keep as many people who
are going to develop serious conditions
out of that pool as possible so yeah I
think that's a completely rational
concern that people have that led to
Gina I think it's one of the few
occasions when as you said they sort of
got out ahead of the possibility of
experiencing this type of discrimination
you know we discussed the bracket one
two mutations we talked about the
biology behind it mm-hmm and we even
mention the idea that myriad was a
company that patented the human gene
sequences the mutations that cause said
that that are the bracket one gene
mutations and this patent these patents
have allowed them to develop a drug that
or a drug a diagnostic acid that no one
else can touch that are the three
dominant Braca 12 mutations and they
have fought vociferous Lee and the
courts to keep those patents it was a
long and bloody battle what uh what is
the current state of gene patenting in
the United States so the current state
of gene patenting thanks to the decision
on jun jun 2013 was june thirteenth 2013
on the myriad case is that human genetic
code is not patentable however code that
is
synthesized from like if you I cannot
say I patent that mutation you have
because I discovered it however if you
synthesize that DNA think it's called
cdna that is patentable because that is
a product of human innovation so a lot
of the debate over the myriad case and
the patenting of genes has really been
about the purpose of patents in the
United States and yeah this whole
history of intellectual property
protection in the United States which is
super fun stuff that probably doesn't
need to be done in depth in a genetics
course but the purpose of the patent
code is to protect the fruits of human
innovation yet if you have worked on
something and you have created something
you are entitled to control it and
profit off of that for a you know
protected period of time which has
changed of course throughout patent
protection history but you're entitled
to exclusively profit off of that for a
period of time as a reward for your
labor in bringing this new thing into
the world so patenting of natural
materials has actually been there's a
pretty extensive case law that this was
not something that you could do because
you can't just you know discover a mold
scoop it out and say I patent this I got
to use this mold alone a lot of people
were arguing that genes the discovery of
a genetic mutation took so much effort
and took so much ingenuity to isolate
and to interpret this information that
that made it patentable and they're
actually uh you know Myriad's patents
were not the first to be issued the
myriad is really just the worst behaved
patent ER of human genetic information
they didn't make any friends exactly
even since the Supreme Court decision
it's
that they're still going after people I
know that there are companies that you
know we're trying to run with the
Supreme Court decision and marry it is
still suing them yes yeah there's plenty
of cleanup work left to be done but yeah
over the course of this litigation a lot
of people were arguing instead of
invalidating patents like this for
instead having a sort of compulsory
licensing system was another idea that
is it's you know common to further
scientific innovation by licensing your
patent licensing your discovery and the
whole problem with myriads holding of
these patents that led to all these
lawsuits is they didn't grant any
licenses which was putting a chokehold
on research and of course in individuals
ability to access a diagnostic test to
determine whether or not they had these
mutations now what about other genes so
I mean obviously we can't patent human
genes can we had cat genes can be patent
regions can be patent bacterial genes
unless they are synthesized and
therefore a product of human innovation
they're not patentable now what I find
fascinating and I don't even know if
you're aware of this or not but cdna and
our students don't know about this yet
we haven't talked about it in the course
but cdna is a type of DNA that's created
when we take an mRNA which is when we
have a gene in our cell and it's turned
on its transcribed into an mRNA we have
enzymes that we can in a lab add to that
add to that mix and turn that mRNA back
into DNA and the interesting thing about
mRNA is it spliced together it
originally starts out really long but we
cut a lot of pieces of the mRNA out and
the resulting you RNA is really short
and it just has the genetic information
that gets turned into the protein so
when you turn an mRNA back into cdna you
only get the relevant coding information
that we shoes but a gene is actually
much bigger a gene itself has tons of
information to called introns that don't
end up in the final product but there
are genes that don't have introns that
are just in Tron less so the mRNA is
pretty much the same length as the gene
itself and I'm really curious to know
what the supreme court thinks of that
because technically the information
in a cdna of an intron less gene is the
exact same as the gene itself so I just
wonder how you know if it really is
about the nature of this of the molecule
or if it has to do more about the
information in the molecule like is it
is it the idea that it's synthesized or
is it the idea that the particular order
of the information is not natural that
is oh really I mean I think that'll be
an interesting question when it
inevitably turns up in court because the
idea at this point is that you can
patent something that is synthesized I
don't know what to tell you about if the
product that you have synthesized is
informational II completely identical to
the natural product I mean although then
the cdna that you're working on would
still be something that you've produced
in the lab the cdna that is you know
being circulated to other labs to do
their research on that is a lab product
as opposed to you know I took a sample
format and I worked on that because it's
informational II identical to the cdna
so I'll be interested yeah I'll be
interested to see how that how that
shakes out but at this time the
distinction really is in the have you
synthesized it have you altered this
from its natural state and it's not
really about informational altering
although it's usually about purifying
and distilling
alright so we're going to transition so
we're going to speak more about sort of
your job or the idea bioethics in
general um how important do you think it
is for us to better understand genetic
information but also the Nexus of
genetics and ethics together for our
future do you think this is going to be
a more pressing need do you think we've
already figured out most of the hard
stuff and the hard steps behind us where
do you see the place of bioethics and
the future of genetics and personalized
medicine I actually think that bioethics
and especially a knowledge of genetics
is increasingly important because you
know bioethics as a concept originated
as an idea of how to protect
participants in research and consumers
of health care people who don't have all
of the training and the information held
by the physicians and the researchers
who are you know bossing them around
standing there in white coats looking
scary and saying give me your blood i'm
going to go do great things with it it's
important in order to protect autonomy
that people have as we've talked about
informed consent you need to have the
information going into a study but i
don't think protecting informed consent
is just about giving someone a form when
they're coming into a study and saying
this is exactly what we're going to do
this is what you're going to experience
do you sign on the dotted line okay it's
about making sure that people have the
tools to understand their participation
in such an area in such a venture in the
first place and that's by ensuring that
people are educated about genetics about
personalized medicine about the
possibilities that their future and
their genetic code actually hold what
that actually means for them the level
of predetermine ISM or not that this
information actually implies and
well I'm perhaps a little bit biased in
favor of the study of bioethics because
i think it is super fun and interesting
and really important but you know
science is advancing it a pretty
breakneck pace and you know we won't
always get out in front of it like with
Gina but someone needs to be paying
attention and you know you never want to
say stand in the way of any kind of
scientific advancement I don't think
that's it all what the study of the
intersection of ethics and science is
about but ensuring beneficial and
responsible use I think is critical to
respecting the people who make research
possible I want to know how did you get
interested in bioethics what's your
background what did you study in school
so my background I came to bioethics as
a philosophy major as an undergraduate I
I began studying human rationality
mostly in philosophical conceptions of
understanding individuals as rational
beings and what your ethical duties to a
rational being are that led me into
studying informed consent and medical
ethics because I found it fascinating I
mean especially how you get informed
consent how you get any kind of consent
from someone who isn't rational was
formerly rational was never rational fun
questions um and then that in turn led
me actually to becoming a lawyer because
I realized that law is the tool that
you're actually going to use to make
sure that people who cannot advocate for
themselves are nonetheless protected so
so understanding genetics for you then
is or at least a certain fundamental
principles of genetics is sort of
essential to understanding what the very
questions are exactly my knowledge of
genetics I took some courses on genetics
as an undergraduate and
you know I sort of tried to keep up
since then has been important toward
understanding what's going on in the
world towards isolating my own research
questions and to my everyday practice as
a lawyer which you know I don't tangle
in bioethics every day I don't tangle in
genetics every day but my background
with you know studying science and the
implications of scientific discovery has
landed me working in intellectual
property and technology at my law firm
where I need to be ready to learn and
understand a new scientific or
technological concept based on whatever
cases thrown at me that particular
moment and you know tools of knowing
genetics has helped me in a couple of
cases definitely that's good to hear so
let's say there's somebody watching this
interview and they're super excited they
really like the idea bioethics I like
genetics and they're interested maybe
you ought they just want to know what
they could do what advice would you give
to a budding young bioethicists well
what would you tell them to study or
what would you tell them to do or where
would you tell them to work a budding
young bioethicists well I'd tell them to
read philosophy because again exposing
my own bias where to work I mean there
are a lot of it's interesting even when
I started studying bioethics there
weren't a lot of jobs for a bio ethicist
now you see jobs for bioethicists at
pharmaceutical companies you know who
want to know both how to do their
research and how to distribute their
product how to market their product
hospitals definitely need people there
are they need bioethics consultants
actually who mediate between physicians
and patients to help help explain the
information and the implications of it
genetic counselors are you know field I
don't know if you've discussed in this
class but that's what we're a lot of
bioethicists wind up is
translating this kind of you know
probabilistic determinism you know
translating that to people who don't
have the educational background always
to understand it and help them make
their decisions based on that
information mm-hmm so yeah best advice I
can give to learning bioethics is just
be open to figuring out what the next
weird issue is going to be and learn all
you can about it that's why bioethics is
