field helps to understand why everything
is determined once we fix a certain
initial amount of fish in this case the
general term would be initial value
these arrows point in the direction in
which our solution curve has to run at
every point in time and every amount of
fish we could draw such an arrow this
arrow specifies the rate of change near
the rate of change is slightly positive
here it's approximately zero here it's
slightly negative and here it is really
hugely negative to see what the system
is doing we simply follow these arrows
or take this one here that's an initial
value we first have to go down and then
in between year once you have specified
the initial condition the initial value
in this case the initial amount of fish
you can trace out such a solution curve
that describes the dependency of the
amount of fish on time or whatever your
differential equation is about there is
such a solution curve and there is no
second solution curve this would not
work this is what mathematicians mean
when they speak of existence and
uniqueness of the solution once you
specify the initial condition there is a
solution curve and there is only one
solution curve well unless I have to say
first thing that may happen is that the
solution escapes to infinity in finite
time then we don't know how to continue
afterward or the solution may fall into
a hole of the definition set of our
equations for instance imagine that we
are simulating a machine and we do not
have any idea about what's happening to
the machine in this region then we can't
continue either the following quiz shows
that this escape to infinity in finite
time can happen easily</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
