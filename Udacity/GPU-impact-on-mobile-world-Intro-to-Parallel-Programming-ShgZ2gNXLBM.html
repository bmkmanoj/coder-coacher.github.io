mobile and so the expectation is that
the sorts of things we do with big GPUs
today maybe one day we'll see big done
or something you carry in your pocket so
where do you see GPU computing having an
impact on sort of the mobile world well
I like I said computing is just sort of
everywhere and it's certainly coming to
the mobile space I think cell phones
today are replacing your laptop PCs and
they're their opportunities and there
are a new mobile device it's something
that's always on carrying it with us
we're interacting with people and
friends as well as ourselves with the
device and that's another opportunity
for computing to make a difference
camera is one area if one thing you do
see is that you know the cell phones are
trying to take over the digital camera
market and there's things that you can
do with a digital camera with a
processor with the interactive test
screen on things like computational
photography and computer vision with the
camera that just wants to be done on the
device and really changes it from a
point a shoot thing to a more dynamic
interface to something interactive and I
hope to see some really cool stuff
happen there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
