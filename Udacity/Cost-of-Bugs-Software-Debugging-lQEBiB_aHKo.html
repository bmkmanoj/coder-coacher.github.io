consuming and all actually translate
into money and effort on a large scale a
commonly cited figure in the literature
is that in any software project at least
50% of the effort is spent on testing
and debugging this number can even go up
to 75% according to a study made in 2002
software bugs are costing the US economy
only 59.5 billion dollars a year and
improvements in testing and debugging
could reduce this cost of software bugs
by 1/3 or 22 billion dollars a year the
main problem with debugging however is
not there it takes time the worst thing
is that it's a search process whose
length is unpredictable it can take
anything between a few minutes a few
hours sometimes even days and weeks so
even if you don't know how much time it
is going to take be sure to use a
systematic process which gradually gets
you towards the cause of the problem but
even if you never know how much time a
bug will take it's a bit of a blessing
to use a process which gradually gets
you towards its cause</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
