this first problem we're going to be
talking a little bit about different
kinds of search trees and let's go ahead
and dive right in now let's say we have
a search tree like so but instead of
branching twice at each level we want to
say that it's going to branch four times
so we have a search tree more like this
where at each level we split four times
that means that since this is a search
tree there are four different possible
paths we could go down at each different
branch now let's also say that this tree
has a height of n over 3 where we're
going to say that n is divisible by 3
just to keep things simpler so we have a
whole lot of n nodes or Leafs down here
at the very end and let's just assume
that there are a total of n over 3
levels now since this is a search tree
all of these end Leafs here represent a
different possible solution that this
search tree could come to so my question
is how many solutions does such a search
tree that splits it four times at each
branch and has a height of n over 3
actually go over how many solutions are
there and please enter your answer in
this box and let's go ahead and say that
this is to the nth power we'll go ahead
and give you that and type this in to
three decimal places please</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
