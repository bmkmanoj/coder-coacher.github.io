is so severe there's probably no lactase
produced at all due to some kind of
significant deletion maybe of the Tata
box in the promoter region if it was
just the enhancer we might expect some
diminished lactase activity but we
wouldn't expect it to be missing
completely severe lactose intolerance
suggests that we have almost no lactase
available so this probably means a
problem in the promoter not the enhancer
there were a lot of different ways that
you could have responded to this
question to the y part of the question
and what I hope you did it spent some
time planning out your answer and
writing it out now there's an OK to a
best level of answering this question in
my opinion and an ok response which
isn't very good and I hope you put more
than this is the promoters mutated
meaning that you are able to select
correctly that it's the promoter and
just indicate that you think that's
where the mutation is but that's not
much of an explanation the next best
answer ranked here is good would be
saying that the promoter likely has a
mutation in the consensus sequence
preventing transcription and causing the
symptoms so understanding that the
actual mutation itself is happening in a
sequence it's a consensus and it blocks
transcription altogether still it leaves
a little bit to be desired a better
answer would be to say that the Tata box
right which we know is the consensus
sequence is likely mutated which
prevents transcription factors from
binding right we know that their
transcription factors that bind and make
transcription happen this results in no
lactase which explains a severe
phenotype a change in the enhancer would
have less of an effect so you not only
understand right that the Tata box is
crucial to the effectiveness of the
promoter but you realize that the
enhancer isn't really doing that much as
far as absolute control right it can it
can boost levels right but it's not
going to essentially take all the
transcription away as we see in the case
of the infant and the best possible
answer here is to be pretty
comprehensive and to say that the can
Tata box of the promoter is likely
deleted or significantly altered as a
result critical transcription factors
can't bind and transcription doesn't
occur so we get no lactase protein and
this would explain the severe phenotype
better than a change or deletion
enhancer region whose alleles seem only
to affect lactase persistence into
adulthood what I'd really like for you
to do is look at your answer from the
previous video screen and I want you to
compare it to these answers here and
then select the checkbox here that you
think best evaluates how you answered
the question if you think you are only
ok check the ok box if you think you
were best check the best box and there
are boxes in between these answers that
you can check as well if you think your
answer is somewhere in the middle go
ahead and do that comparison now and
then select which box you think fairly
assesses your answer to this question</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
