reducibility by introducing another
problem on social networks that will
call the s independent set problem and
the problem goes like this given a graph
H and a number s is there a set of nodes
of size s the set is the size s not the
nodes in H such that no two nodes in a
set are connected in the original graph
H in some sense they are independent of
each other you can think of this as the
find the strangers problem right so they
need to be in the social network
together but none of them know each
other so for example if we look in this
graph H for an independent set of size 3
we notice that there's at least this
triple sort of a this set of nodes where
none of the pair's know each other we
can't make it any bigger than this at
least including those three nodes
because every other of the nodes that we
didn't include is connected to at least
one of these guys I think this is
probably the biggest independent set in
this graph all right so now what we're
going to try to do is reduce this
problem to cake leak or more concretely
show how a polynomial time solution to K
gleek solves the S independent set
problem so here's four approaches that
we might be able to use to solve this
problem one is first note that the S
independent set problem can be solved by
guessing a set of nodes and then making
sure that none of the pairs of nodes in
that set are connected all you have to
do is check s squared edges or big theta
of s squared edges so this runs in
polynomial time here's another
possibility let's actually take the
graph H and run the S cleek algorithm on
it that is to say the cake week
algorithm but we use we're looking for a
clique of size s and whatever it returns
return the opposite of the answer the
idea being that if graph has a very big
Gleek in it there's lots of nodes that
are densely connected then it's unlikely
to have a large independence at all
right here's another approach let's take
the graph H and build a new graph G that
is the complement of H that is to say
every place there's an edge in H there's
no edge in G every place there's no edge
in
there is an edge in G then we run the S
khaliq algorithm the cake leak algorithm
looking for a clique of size s on this
new graph G and whatever answer it gives
just return the opposite so if it says
that there is a an S click in G return
false and if it says there's no s click
in G then return true and this last
option is the reverse of that so you
build the compliment graph you runt you
look for a size s click in that graph
and if there is one say yes and if there
isn't one say no so think about these a
little bit maybe even sketch an example
problem for yourself to see which of
these make sense</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
