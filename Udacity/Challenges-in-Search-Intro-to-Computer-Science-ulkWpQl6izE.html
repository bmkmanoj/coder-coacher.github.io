major problems search engines are trying
to solve today so I hope we'll see some
creative solutions of new things that
you can do with search engines as part
of the contest and we'll be releasing
the full details on that soon the kinds
of things that are probably the biggest
things that commercial search engines
are working on today one is always
getting better results right finding
better ways to find the best page
finding ways to respond to queries that
are more complex and have more than just
one keyword doing things that will get
people what they're searching for the
other thing that I think is probably a
big effort in is in increasing arms race
is dealing with efforts to get pages
ranked highly that aren't that good so
people are trying to do things they call
it link spam sometimes trying to make
pages that will rank highly but don't
have good content and this is sort of a
never ending battle between the search
engine companies and the people who want
to create content that ranks highly
every time to Google tweaks their
algorithm lots of people get upset
because their page ranks go down that
could be unfair it could be because
while they have good content and that
new algorithm is unfair to them it could
be because they are going to being
tweaked to try to remove things from
high ranks that don't have the content
that users are actually looking for so
that's really a never-ending battle to
try to get the best results and there's
also a lot of effort to kind of instead
of just returning query those turning
results for a given search query but to
answer questions yeah and so you can go
into whatever search engine you use and
ask like when is New Year's what days
new years are the chinese new years and
it'll give you the date instead of just
in addition to the results and i'll
start answering questions and this is
kind of the first step in to kind of
organizing search engines around what we
want to know yeah and some search
engines like Google and DuckDuckGo are
pretty good with questions like that to
actually understand natural language
well enough to be able to answer a
complex question that doesn't fit some
known structure is a really hard problem
but is definitely something that is in
the future of search engines to do that
well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
