sequel or structured query language
sequel is a language it's not quite a
programming language but it's a language
for expressing queries and so you would
use sequel on a relational database to
ask questions of the database you know
to get that out of it so my sequel
PostgreSQL sequel Lite obviously they
all have sequel a name and they all use
sequel for putting data into the
database and getting data out it was
invented in the 1970s which was long
before the internet existed or the web
existed or web applications even existed
so sequel was designed to solve problems
that are very much different from the
problems you'll be solving building you
know a consumer web application there's
still a lot of very important parts the
sequel and we'll be discussing the major
pieces today so you can you know know
how to use them but just keep in mind
that sequel and relational databases
have existed long before a web and so
there's some things that aren't exactly
relevant sequel looks a little something
like this
this is a basic sequel query and what
this says is select which basically
means retrieve data star this means all
columns from links this is the table
that we're fetching data from where ID
equals 5 and this is a this is a
constraint so sequel as you can see you
know it's a fairly readable language
select all from links where ID equals 5
that's almost the similar to the quiz I
gave you earlier in this in this lesson
there are a couple parts of this line
that are relevant this first section the
Select star this is basically what we're
selecting the star can instead of being
a star it can actually be a list of
columns but for a lot of things we're
gonna be doing we'll be selecting all of
the columns but if you don't want all of
the columns let's say you just wanted
just the URL from the links it might
look something like this select URL and
you could you could put comma you know
select URL title if you wanted to select
just the URL and the title but we'll be
using star for now now from this is the
from clause right here
this is where we're going to fetch the
data from so we've only talked about
really one table our links table and in
my example that's how I'm going to use
but you can actually include you know
any table if you're making or multiple
tables and we'll talk briefly about you
know what that what that means a little
bit later but for now we're just going
to be selecting from the links table and
that's the name of the table we made
we're now the rest of the sequel or the
rest of the sequel you can see here this
is the where clause and these are the
constraints these are which rows from
our table to return and this is actually
a really interesting part of the of the
statement here we can actually put quite
a lot in here
let's play around with this a little bit
on the IDE and see how it works</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
