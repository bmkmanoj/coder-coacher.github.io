place the last step to get in the core
data structure set up is creating our
managed objects creating our managed
objects is actually easier than you
might think because in fact we did most
of the work already when we created our
model file now all we need to do in
order to generate our managed object
files is click on our data model click
editor and then click create ns-managed
object subclass from here we select the
model file we'd like to create entity
classes from and then the entities or
objects we would like to be managed here
we'll select both note and notebook
because we want to manage both of them
and we'll click Next and then create
cool and here they are tada but wait a
minute how come there are four files
here so when you generate these managed
classes two files are actually created
for each entity you have a class file
and you have an extension the extension
file contains code that matches up with
our object model you never ever want to
write anything into these extensions
because Xcode will overwrite them and
recreate the class if you modify the
model so it's good to write any code
inside of the managed object class
itself now let's just move these down to
the model folder where they belong and
feel free to pause the video here and go
ahead and generate these managed object
classes on your own great so this note
class is looking pretty bare what we
need to do now is add in an init method
so this class can create usable
instances of itself we'll add in a
convenience in it which takes text a
string with the words new note in it and
in NS managed object context called
context then what we need to do is
create an NS entity description an
entity description is an object that has
access to all the information we
provided in the entity part of the model
and it's needed in order to instantiate
any managed object class from the entity
description we call entity for name
which takes in the name of the entity so
in this case note and the context in
which we want the note to live in
managed object context context then we
can call the designated initializer
which is the initializer for ns-managed
object the superclass which takes in the
entity
description and the context in order to
create a new instance and you can see
the parameter name says in certain to
managed object context which is where
the instance will live remember that
every single core data object needs to
know its context lastly we just
initialize some properties text will
equal text which we can remember is the
new note and creation date will get
initialized to NS date object which is
just the current date we'll put in this
fatal error in case no entity exists and
the entity name we're passing in and
we're done I'm also just going to add in
this variable which is just a formatted
version of that creation date property
we initialized up there it just makes
the date more human readable and that's
it we can now just do the same thing for
the notebook class awesome why don't you
give it a try before moving ahead to the
next video make sure you have both in
its and get no warnings</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
