method for adapting a case once again we
are in this micro world let us suppose
that we begin from our office and we
need to go to a restaurant given the
problem of going from the office to the
restaurant let us suppose that we
retrieve from memory a case it takes us
to a doctor's office which is quite
close to the restaurant but not the same
as a restaurant so one way in which I
might be able to unlock this case that
I've retrieved to address the problem
going from the office to the restaurants
to do a search using this model this map
of the world which tells me that you go
from the doctor's office to the
restaurant as you can take this
particular route so now I have the
earlier case which are adapted using
some model of the world this is an
example of using models in order to
adapt cases so in my programming example
earlier instead of having a map of the
world we might have for example an API
for interacting with a particular
language I've done input from a file in
Python several hundred times but I've
never done it in Java before I know that
the overall process of doing it from
Java is going to be very similar to the
process of doing it in Python and I have
a model of the way Java works to know
how to actually translate my case of
doing in Python to doing it in Java good
example David there is another one this
one is from design when we design
various kind of products let's suppose a
VLSI circuit for example then we not
only know something about the
configuration of the elements in the
design we also have a model of how that
particular configuration is supposed to
work in fact it might amuse you David
that about 25 years back in the 80s when
I wrote my PhD dissertation it was one
of the first PhD dissertations that
integrated model base piece unit case
based reasoning that was exactly the
idea in my PhD dissertation you use
models to be able to adapt evaluate and
store cases</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
