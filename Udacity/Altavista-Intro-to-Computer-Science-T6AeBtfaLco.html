is thinking about our random surfer
model if this was our model if a page
has no incoming links well as popularity
ranking would be zero we don't want to
have have that be the case if we think
of our random web surfer
well she randomly starts at the page she
could randomly start at a page that has
no links if we made all the page scores
zero for pages with no links well then
it would be very hard for a new page to
get started so we don't want those to be
0 so we're going to have some random
probability that you reach a page even
when it has no links so that means we're
going to add something to this sum so
it's not 0 when there are no incoming
links and the other thing we're going to
do is we're going to scale this
summation a little bit and we're going
to scale that with what is called the
damping function and that just means if
we think of our random web surfer again
even if she's following a path that does
have more links at some point she might
decide to get tired and give up and
start again with a new random page so
the damping function determines how
frequently we think our random web
surfer will pick a random link versus
starting over again on a new random page
so that's called the damping value and
we're just going to use the damping
value to scale this number so we'll call
that D that's the damping constant a
typical value for that is something less
than 1 and a good value of something
like 0.8 so now we're going to change
our rank function to take into account
of that we're going to have some initial
value and if we want to keep the values
in a reasonable range instead of
starting from 1 we're going to divide
the values by the total number of pages
and the reason for that is just to keep
the ranks in some meaningful range this
will keep the ranks so the total of the
ranks when we start the sum of the ranks
is 1 that gives them a little more
meaning than of the sum of the ranks
with the number of pages so n is going
to be the number of pages the total
number in our corpus and D is the
damping constant and so now we're going
to change our initial values to divide
them by n this means the sum of the page
ranks at the beginning will be 1 and
we're going to change the way we compute
the rank by adding to it a value that
correspondence of starting over so
the value that we're going to use for
this is 1 minus D divided by N and that
gives the notion that the times when we
don't decide to do a new page so point a
to the time we decide to follow a new
page so we're going to multiply this by
D the times when we don't follow a new
page that's 1 minus D we're going to
start over and we're going to divide
that by n because n is the number of
pages that's the probability that this
is the page that would be picked when we
start over
so now we've got our recursive
definition of page rank we start by
initializing the rank at time set 0 to 1
mod by N and then for as many times as
we want we're going to keep improving
our results by using this formula for
each link that links to us we're going
to take its popularity on the last step
divide that by the number of out links
so it's dividing it by the number of
other pages that links to multiply that
by our damping constant and that gives
the probability that this page was
selected by the random web surfer and
then we're going to add the term that
takes into account the random web surfer
might have started over from scratch and
picked a new random page so before we
try to change our web search engine to
actually program this it's time for a
little quiz and the quiz is what is Alta
Vista and if you don't know this feel
free to use Google or DuckDuckGo to find
out these are the choices so it's the
view from the Udacity headquarters in
Palo Alto it's the most popular web
search engine in 1998 it is Spanish for
your terminated baby and it's a small
town in Virginia and feel free to Google
the answer if you don't know</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
