happens if we take this HTML string and
put this through a binary search
simplification process here's our HTML
string and we first check the first half
and see if it failed and yes this also
fails but now we are splitting this
string into two sub strings namely this
one it passes and now the second one and
it passes as well and in this case the
binary search algorithm is stuck because
well first half doesn't result in a
simplification second half doesn't
result in simplification either so we
stop here and simply return the entire
string which is what binary search does
as humans of course we have a good idea
on what to do next what we would do is
well we could for instance go and cut
away smaller parts for instance in here
we already would see the structure
select and foo we could for instance go
and remove the FO because it's different
from the HTML tag a computer may not
recognize these structures but what a
computer can do still is to try to
remove smaller chunks that is rather
than trying to remove entire halves we
will try to remove say quarters or
eighths of the input until we are down
to removing single characters what we do
in this situation is we increase the
granularity that is we take away smaller
parts more frequently until we end up
removing single characters such that we
really really get an input where every
single character or every single part is
relevant for producing the failure this
precise strategy is called Delta
debugging and here's how it works</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
