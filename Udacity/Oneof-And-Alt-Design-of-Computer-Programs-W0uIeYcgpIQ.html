now remember the way the compiler works
is the constructor for each of the
patterns take some arguments a string an
x and y pattern whatever and it's going
to return a function that matches the
protocol that we've defined for the
compiler and the protocol is that each
pattern function will take a set of
numbers where the set of numbers is the
list of possible lengths that we're
looking for and then I'll return a set
of strings so what have I done for
literal s I've said we return the
function which takes a set of numbers as
input and if the length of the string is
in that set of numbers so if the literal
string was hello
and if hello has five letters and a five
is one of the numbers we're trying to
look for then return the set consisting
of a single element the string itself
otherwise return the null set star I can
define in terms of other things plus
I've defined in terms of a function gen
sequence that we'll get to in a minute a
little bit complicated it's really the
only complicated one here we can reduce
all the other complications down to
calling plus which calls gen sequence
nears sequence does that too I've
introduced epsilon which is the standard
name and language theory for the empty
string so it's the empty string it
matched it's the same as just literal of
the empty string which matches just
itself if we're looking for strings of
length 0 for dot dot matches any
character I've decided to just return a
question mark to indicate that you could
return all 256 characters or whatever
you want your results would start to get
bigger and bigger so you change that if
you want to and I've left space for you
to do some work so give me the
definitions for one of cares you know if
we ask for one of the characters ABC
what should that match and what it
should match is if one is an element of
ends then it should be a B and C
otherwise shouldn't be anything and
similarly for alt give me the code for
that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
