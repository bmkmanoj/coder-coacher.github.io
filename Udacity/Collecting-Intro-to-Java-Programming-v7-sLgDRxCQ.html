collecting values in a class he is
already the instance variable that does
the collecting before we forget let's
make sure it's initialized in the
constructor here we go by the way I did
forget that when I prepared the solution
let's see here here we need to add a
string to the collection here's the code
for that now sometimes the code really
is as simple as this it's still
necessary to have a separate method
because of course passengers is a
private instance variable that the
public can't use in our example the app
passenger method is a bit more complex
because we should only add when there's
space last time around we had a counter
for the number of passengers we don't
have that this time but we have a method
down here so I'll just call that method
and again if there's room then I'll do
the adding it looks like we actually
have to implement that method that's
simply the size of the collection the
last method here gives us more
information about the contents of our
collection unfortunately it's already
been implemented it simply returns the
ArrayList converted to a string which
has this characteristic form all of the
strings inside surrounded by brackets so
that's the general collection pattern
anytime that an object wants to collect
other objects use an ArrayList or an
array such as this one and did I mention
that you should never forget to
initialize the array list or array in
the constructor you will get to practice
these patterns with another example
that's dear to Sarah's hard</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
