heritable so are you say that there's a
tight jean well not exactly a single
hygiene the heritability values don't
tell us about the number or type of
genes involved in a given trait
heritability values don't exactly tell
us about the genetic differences that
could be contributing to the trait
themselves for example we don't know if
we're looking for mrs. mutation or
nonsense mutation or chromosomal
translocation someplace in the genome so
why should somebody still care about her
ability well heritability can tell us if
genetic factors are involved at all and
actually might even be able to tell us
how easy it would be to find out what
those genetic factors are for example a
heritability close to one would signify
that there are probably a few genes
responsible for the variability in the
trade and that they have a strong
influence this means that we'd be able
to perhaps find out what they are even
in a relatively small study size but the
lower the heritability the farther away
from one we get and the closer to zero
the more likely it is that there are
many genes that have an effect each with
a smaller influence over all and it
would take a much larger study size to
find the effects of those particular
genetic factors</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
