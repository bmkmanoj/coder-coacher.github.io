1 and y 2 should be two from the
solution for X we can tell that the
basis is the first two columns here so
we'll go ahead and call that B and we
want to perform row operations on this
so that we hit this part of the
objective value exactly and achieve
equality will call this portion of the
objective coefficients C be setting up
the linear equations we have that Y
transpose B should be equal to CB
transpose and by simple back
substitution we achieve the it right
answer we can check the answer by making
sure that it gives us the same objective
value so substituting in here we have 2
plus 4 times 2 which is equal to 10 and
for the dual our solution is 10 as well
we have 1 times 6 which is 6 and 2 times
2 which is four and adding them together
we also get 10 we should also check the
feasibility of our dual solution by
checking that the bound on the
coefficients for the objective function
behave themselves for these coefficients
as well and indeed they do we get one
here and negative 2 here for a total of
negative 1 which is indeed greater than
negative 2 and regarding x4 we have 1
times 2 which is one minus one times two
so that's 0 and 0 is indeed greater than
the negative one here so our choice for
y was indeed feasible</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
