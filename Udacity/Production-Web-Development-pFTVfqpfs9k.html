tend to store the secret key in a
completely separate machine from the one
you were developing on and you mentioned
the concept of a production machine and
some of our students were wondering if
you could go into that a bit more at
that sure sure we can definitely talk
about that there's a few feel a little
edge cases nothing major that we will
just talk about your on the whiteboard
it should be should help you out so how
to have a distinction between production
and development the way we've always
structures stuff on my projects is we'll
have a file usually we call it like you
know production that pie and depending
on the framework we're using sometimes
this this kind of notion is built in you
know when you when you when you launch
your program locally you say something
like dev you know app whatever I don't
know staff complete it and you can give
it a bunch of configuration options
often you can give it a configuration
file as well this isn't always the case
sometimes what we do is in the simple
case we just have production at five dot
pie and we'll have develop I and these
are both basically have a bunch of
global variables things like secret keys
that you're going to use for your
cookies or your passwords that sort of
thing you know and we'll have one that's
only in production and one that's only
using development and this one may be
included are included on our repository
and this one may be on may only exist on
our service or you know may exist in our
repository but generally we don't like
that stuff getting shared around
especially if it's open source for
example reddit's open source so we don't
include production that pie publicly but
I think we do include a development that
pie for you guys to use locally and then
when we deploy code on our own machines
we just simply you know to config that
pie whichever one we want so I think our
apps by default look for the velvet pie
and if not if it's not their users
config that pie which made symlink to
like production up high and we also have
a bunch of different configuration files
you know whether you're an app server or
whether your database or because we have
all these different machines that serve
different purposes so I put all my stuff
in one module and then we have this is
complicated symlink set up when we do
deployments that basically says this app
server is doing this
job therefore it should use this file
and you can copy it a place you can
symlink it you can do all sorts of
clever stuff sometimes it's built into
the frame work on Hipmunk it's built
into the framework we just say you know
F F dot pi is the name of our main
executable and I can just say dash dash
dash dash config equals and then we
specify one of these files and that was
great so there's no like ease there's no
easy correct answer simple thing just
store your Global's in in different
files if you want to keep them secret
and then when you're deploying it kind
of figure out how to decide which file
you want to use hope that helps</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
