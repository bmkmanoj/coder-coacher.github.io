someone is trying a brute force attack
they don't have to sort of search for
things in the dark but the real if
they're smart they would start with more
popular passwords so the one two three
four fives or password whatever it is so
you actually can sort of reduce the
amount of work that you have to do by
trying out more popular passwords first
in fact what you can do is create what
is called a rainbow table which is
nothing but potential passwords and
their hash values and is a table that
you create okay the hash value table for
each possible password and so this is
you don't even have to run your hash
function when you're doing this brute
force guessing you're just doing a
lookup a rainbow table saying this
password let me see what its
corresponding hash value is and does
that match some entry in the rainbow
table without having to compute the hash
function you can have these other tricks
you you can use if you're that hacker is
use a rainbow table or be smart and try
more popular passwords first the couple
of other things related to to passwords
and they're guessing and things like
that we said what if to users speak the
same password if they're common
passwords then of course 1 2 3 4 5 is
picked by lots and lots of users how do
we avoid this problem we in one of the
quiz questions we said what would happen
if the hash value was the same it's sort
of related here if they do have the same
password they'll have the same hash
value and by looking at the hash values
we can see that from one person's
password we can log in as the other user
and that would be a problem fortunately
if we have a solution to that we add a
random number before we do the hashing
we take the password strength add this
random salt the random salt will be
different for different users that makes
the hash value different for different
users if to pass users pick the same
password without the salt that hash
value will be the same but with the salt
the hash value will be different and we
will know whether that the passwords are
the same or they're different because
the hash values could be different
either because of the
passwords being different or the salt
being different you'll have to store the
salt because later on when we do the
check we're going to get a password we
need the salt before we can run the hash
again so we can compare it with the
hashed value so we're going to need the
salt where do you store the salt you
store it in the file where you store the
hash value whoever has access to the
hashed value would also have access to
the salt which is fine we actually not a
problem so this checking when we have
salt is done by combining or computing
the hash function with both the salt and
the password</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
