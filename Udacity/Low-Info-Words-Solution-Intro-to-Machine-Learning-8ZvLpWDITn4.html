to say exactly which ones you think are
in our low information because it kind
of depends on what you're looking for
but here are a few that are classically
just not gonna have that much
information the word duh the word thaw
shows up in almost every message that
you're ever gonna see so the fact that
the word the shows up doesn't really
tell you what the message is about
because it's always gonna be there I
would say the same thing is probably
true of the word will and in this
context also where we're looking at
emails about the word high occurs a lot
and so seeing the word high doesn't
necessarily tell you anything very
specific about what the message is about
you could have also said that Katie and
Sebastian are low information words
because every message has these two
words in them all the messages are about
Katie and or Sebastian so knowing that
those words are there isn't necessarily
telling you anything but I would argue
that usually names are something that
you would want to be able to keep</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
