thing to think about when you look at
the modular things and try to decide
which is best if it's a good module we
should be able to give it a name it
should be conceptually corresponding to
something we're thinking about and if
you look at the modules here the way a
is divided all of the things in a are
things that you can do before a query
comes in these are things that you're
doing based on just building the corpus
of the web all the things in the second
module here are things that you can do
only after a query comes in and it makes
a lot of sense to divide those two
phases in version B I've grouped lookup
in the first module and lookup is used
by both lucky search and ordered search
it's not used by any of the functions
that build a corpus so it doesn't really
make a lot of sense to have it here if
we have it here the interface between
these two modules is going to be much
more complex than it would be if we put
lookup in the second module so that's
why I prefer option a to either the
other two options C doesn't really make
much sense to have a lookup B all its
own module there are certainly other
options and I would encourage you to
discuss them in the forum if you have
another suggestion of how to modular as
