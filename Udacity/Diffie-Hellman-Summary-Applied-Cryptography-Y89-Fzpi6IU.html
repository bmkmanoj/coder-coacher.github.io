this protocol depends on the integrity
of the message is received one easy way
to see how it could fail if an active
attacker can change the value of y a 21
and change the value of y be 21 well
then Alice and Bob will still agree on a
key but that key would be 1 raised to
their secret power which is still one it
would be the key value one which would
be known to the eavesdropper and make
all message and encrypted using that key
vulnerable the attacker could also
intercept the protocol here and
separately execute the protocol with
each party this was make Ellis think
that she's has a secure key with Bob but
it's actually a secure key shared with
the attacker in the middle and it would
make Bob think that he has a secure key
with Alice but it's actually a key
shared with the attacker in the middle
and that means the attack in the middle
could take a message that alice encrypts
with this key that's actually shared
with the attacker in the middle can
decrypt that message can then reenact I
that the attacker shared with Bob and
send the result to Bob Bob will decrypt
thinking it's a good message from Alice
so this is a very dangerous attack so
difficult can only been used in places
where either the integrity of the
channel is guaranteed or there's a way
for Bob to find out Alice's why a value
and know that it's really Alice it could
also be useful in a case where there's
some trusted directory that has the Y
values and Bob could look up Alice's why
a value no the Q and the g values and
then Bob would know that he's
communicating with Alice if he trusts
this directory one way to provide that
is using a certificate authority which
we'll talk about in unit 5</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
