simple illustration helps to make that
clear using a seemingly obvious data
element gender
it also helps explain the difference
between syntax which is structure and
semantics which is meaning here in
system a male is represented by a 1 and
female by zero over here in system B
that's reversed with 0 representing male
and one representing female should you
mix data from these two systems without
some intervening standard gender would
be impossible to determine accurately
for reporting and other purposes we say
these two systems differ syntactically
they may be using the same language of
ones and zeros but they can't
interoperate without some intermediate
translation process that map's one to
the other or both to some common syntax
over in system C M is used for male and
F for female we say that system C
differs semantically from systems a and
B it uses a different language to
represent gender
moreover system C recognizes the gender
may be ambiguous and represents that
with a u a concept the other two systems
don't deal with interoperability between
system C and the other two systems would
require translation from its syntax to
theirs or translations of both syntaxes
to a common form a standard since
patients with gender you can't be
represented in systems a and B some
accommodation for that would also have
to be made if something is seemingly
simple and obvious as gender can lead to
this much complexity imagine what
happens with concepts such as a
patient's diagnosis which is inherently
somewhat subjective and can have
thousands of possible values that's why
we need data standards</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
