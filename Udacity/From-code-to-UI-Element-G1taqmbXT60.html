audio function executing every time the
user presses the record audio button
this is an example of going from user
interface element in this case the
record button to your code using an IB
action what about going the other way
from code to user interface element
maybe we want to enable or disable a
button we want to change the text of a
label when you go from code to UI
element you use a connection called an
iboutlet otherwise known as an outlet
from code to UI element let's add that
one of those in to start with let's open
back the inspectors panel by clicking
this button here on the top right make
sure the library is selected here on the
right in addition for a moment I'm going
to come out of the assistant editor just
to give me more screen real estate there
we go now I can see my interface I'm
going to drag over a label and a button
start with I'm going to search for label
found the one I'm going to drag one here
and I'm going to name this label tap to
record and I'm going to reposition it
back in the middle and then I'm going to
search for a button I'm going to drag
another button on here try to Center it
as best as I can in the center of the
screen double-click inside and type in
stop recording for the buttons text
don't worry about the layout yet we're
going to tackle that in just a bit now
pay attention because here comes the
unintuitive part we want to make a
connection from code to UI element in
this case the tap to record label from
the document outline find our tab to
record label as you can see highlight
here hold down the control key and drag
it into our view controller class select
outlet and name this recording label you
can now see X goes create an outlet for
us linking the UI element into code or I
so we're going to use it an outlet from
code where we can change the UI element
let's use this iboutlet let's make the
text change after the record button has
been pressed so what we want here is we
want the text of the recording label to
change when record button is pressed
you already know which code gets called
when a recording button is pressed
that's the function we were earlier as
an IB action right here we can add the
following line to the record audio
function if you run the app now and
press on the record audio button you
should be able to see the text change to
recording in progress we can see that
our label and button are not positioned
correctly that's ok if we press this
button we should see this change from
tap to record into recording in progress
so we've used an IV action to receive an
interaction even on the button and then
we use an iboutlet to reach back from
code to UI element in this case the
label and change this text</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
