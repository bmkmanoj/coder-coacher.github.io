behind the hash table now our goal is to
map a key word and a number of buckets
using a hash string function to a
particular bucket and that bucket will
contain all of the key words that map to
that location so now what we're gonna do
is try to actually write the code to do
this we're gonna start from our index
that we wrote for the previous unit but
try to figure out how to implement that
with a hash table instead so the first
question is how is this going to change
our data structure so this was what we
had before if you remember we had our
index was a list of keywords we had a
list of entries and each entry was a
pair which was a keyword and the second
element of the pair was a list of the
URLs where that word appears and we
would have each word in the index as its
own entry with its own list of URLs so
this was the data structure that we used
last class now we want to change things
to implement a hash table so I want you
to think about what data structure we'll
use and we'll make that a quiz to decide
a good data structure to use to
implement the hash table so the question
is which of these data structures would
make most sense to implement the hash
table index the first choice is a list
where the elements in the list are a
list where the first element is a word
and the second element is a list of URLs
where that word appears the second
choice is a list where each element in
the list is the list itself where the
first element is a word and the second
element is a list of Lists where each
element in that list is a list of URLs
so the third choice is a list where each
element is a list where the element
lists themselves contain lists where the
element lists of the element lists are a
list of a word followed by a list of all
the URLs where that word appears so we
have three nested lists for choice three
for choice four we have a list where
each element of the list is a list where
within the element list there's another
list which is a list of words followed
by a list of URLs and for the final
choice we also have three nested lists
where each element lists
is a list where the elements of that
lists are lists that are word followed
by a list where each element in that
list is a list of URLs so which one of
these would be the best structure to use
to implement a hash table</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
