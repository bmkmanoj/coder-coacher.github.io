superscalar processor will try to
execute more than one instruction per
cycle the liw processors are trying to
achieve the same amount of work per
cycle but in a different way so let's
compare the two approaches and see how
the vyw processors differ from the out
of order and in order superscalar
processors that we have been already
seen so what we will do is compare the
out-of-order superscalar processor the
in order superscalar processor and the
very long instruction word or V liw
processor according to several things
first how many instructions per cycle do
we try to do and any issue out-of-order
superscalar processor is trying to do up
to n instructions per cycle and in-order
superscalar processor is also trying to
do up to n instructions per cycle av liw
processor is different in that it tries
to execute one large instruction per
cycle but that one large instruction
does the same work as n normal
instructions would do so really we are
trying to do the same work per cycle but
the superscalar processors are trying to
do more than one simple instruction per
cycle whereas a VLIW processor does one
large instruction that really does the
same work as n of these but it needs to
be given a single instruction to do per
cycle in terms of how do we find
independent instructions that we can do
in a cycle the out-of-order superscalar
processor finds it's n instructions by
looking at much more than this number of
instructions in its instruction window
so it fetches the code is and then kind
of has a window of more than n
instructions and among these it's trying
to find the N that it needs to execute
in contrast and in order superscalar
processor is trying to execute up to n
instructions per cycle by looking at
only the next end instructions in
program order so it doesn't maintain
this huge instruction window among which
it is trying to find n instructions
instead it just tries to see whether the
next end instructions or some subset of
can be executed in program order in
parallel AVL IW processor doesn't even
try to find independent instructions it
simply tries to do the next large
instruction so it behaves like a non
superscalar processor that executes
instructions in order it's just that
each of these instructions is really
describing a lot of work in terms of
hardware cost this looking at many
instructions in order to find the end
that we are looking for in an
out-of-order superscalar processor is
really expensive
the in-order superscalar processor does
a lot less work and needs a lot less
hardware to find the instructions so
it's less expensive in terms of hardware
costs than there out-of-order
superscalar cousins the V liw processor
reduces that cost even further so it's
even less expensive than an in-order
superscalar processor for the same
amount of work per cycle assuming we can
find that work because we are now even
simpler in finding that work and that
brings us to our last point which is
does the processor need help from the
compiler in an out-of-order superscalar
processor it does pretty well even
without any compiler help but the
compiler can help improve the program
performance and in-order superscalar
processor is more dependent on the
compiler if the compiler doesn't do
anything to put independent instructions
consecutively then an in-order
superscalar processor will not have good
performance its performance will lack
significantly the performance that an
out-of-order processor with the same
issue with would be able to achieve so
an in-order superscalar processor really
needs help from the compiler without
such help it is going to perform
significantly worse than an out-of-order
processor would and finally a viola w
processor completely depends on the
compiler to produce performance if we
don't have a good compiler a VLIW
processor will fail miserably as far as
performance is concerned so as we can
see among this
three the out-of-order superscalar
processor is trying to do kind of like a
hardware intensive I don't need much
help from anybody but it sacrifices
harder to do that and in order
superscalar processor tries to reduce
the hardware cost but still can execute
the same program that an out-of-order
superscalar processor could and in some
programs it really needs compiler help
in order to achieve good performance and
finally a viola w processor goes to the
extreme of completely depending on the
compiler to provide and express the
parallelism it needs to do work but in
exchange it gives us much lower cost</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
