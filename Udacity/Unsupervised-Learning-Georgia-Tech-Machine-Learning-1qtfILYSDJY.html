so unsupervised learning we don't get
those examples we have just essentially
something like input and we have to
derive some structure from them just by
looking at the relationship between the
inputs themselves right so give me an
example of that so when you're studying
different kinds of animals say even as a
kid you might start to say oh there's
these animals that all look kind of the
same they're all four-legged I'm gonna
call all of them dogs even if they
happen to be horses or cows or whatever
but I have developed without anyone
telling me this sort of notion that all
these belong in the same class and it's
different from things like trees which
don't have four legs well some do but I
mean damn they both bark is all I'm
saying
did I really set you up for that I don't
repair so I would apologize to each and
every one of you for that but that was
pretty good Michael is very good at word
play which I guess is often unsupervised
as well no I get a lot of these really
good a lot of feedback yeah that's right
tactic please stop
so if supervised learning is about
function approximation then unsupervised
learning is about description it's about
taking a set of data and figuring out
how you might divide it up in one way or
the other or maybe even summarization
it's not just a description but it's a
shorter describe is usually a concise
compact description so I might take a
bunch of pixels like I have here it
might say hey oh wait wait wait wait I'm
pixels now as far as we can tell yeah
that's fine I however not pixels I know
I'm not pixels I'm pretty sure the rest
of your pixels that's so I have a bunch
of pixels and I might say male and or I
might say female or I might say dog or I
might say tree but the point is I don't
have a bunch of labels it's a dog tree
male or female I just decide that pixels
like this belong the pixels like this as
opposed to pixels like something else
that I'm pointing to mine you know we're
living in a world right now that is
devoid of any other objects Oh cheers
Cheers
right here so these pixels are very
different from those pixels because of
where they are relative to the other
pictures okay right so if you were
literature that's helping me understand
on supervised learning go out and go
outside and look at a crowd of people
and try to decide how you might divide
them up maybe you'll divide them up by
Anisa tea maybe we'll divide them up by
whether they have purposely shave in
their hair in order to mock the ball or
whether they have curly hair
maybe you'll divide them up by whether
they have go tease your hair or whether
they have gray hair there's lots of
things that you might do in order to I
didn't mean to take gray hair I was
pointing in your head hon the pixilated
secrets of Tudor Mitchell right there
right where your spit curl is all right
okay so imagine you're dividing the
world up that way you could divide it up
male/female you about up short tall
wears hats doesn't wear hats all kinds
of ways you can divide it up and no
one's telling you the right way to
divide it up at least not directly
that's unsupervised learning that's
description because now rather than
having to send pixels of everyone or
having to do a complete description of
this crowd you can say there were 57
males and 23 females okay
or there were mostly people with beards
so or whatever I like summarization for
that that's like summarization for that
it's a nice concise description that's
ok provides are very good and that's
different from supervisor it's different
in supervised learning and it's
different in a couple of ways one way
that it's different is all of those ways
that we could have just divided up the
world in some sense are all equally good
so I could divide up by sex or I could
divide it by high target divide it by
clothing or whatever and they're all
equally good apps in some other signal
later telling you how you should be
dividing up the world but supervised
learning directly tells you there's a
signal this is what it ought to be and
that's how you train very different but
I could see ways that unsupervised
learning could be helpful in the
supervised setting right so if I do get
a nice description and it's the right
kind of description it might help me map
too it might help me do the function
approximation better right so instead of
taking pixels at input as input and then
labels like male or female I could just
simply take a summarization of you like
how much hair your relative height to
weight and very things like that then I
help me do it that's right and by the
way in practice this turns out to be
things like density estimation we do end
up turning it into statistics at the end
of the day after it was statistics from
the beginning but when you say density
estimation yes are you saying I'm stupid
all right so what is density estimation
well they'll have to take the class
divided by I see okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
