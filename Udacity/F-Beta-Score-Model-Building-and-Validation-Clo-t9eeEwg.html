recall individually and looking at each
to make a decision as to the performance
of a classifier we can actually use at
something called the f beta score this
is the general definition of the f beta
score the beta here can have various
values depending on how much weight one
wants to give to their precision value
over the recall value using a
combination of precision and recall such
as the f beta score can be very helpful
because it gives you one number to
maximize rather than two if you're
trying to decide between two different
models and one has a higher precision
but a lower recall which will you choose
one method would be to choose the model
with the higher area under the ROC curve
another method would be to choose the
model with the higher f beta score now
let's try to set beta equals one setting
beta equals one you can see that the f1
score is given by this formula this is
simply the harmonic mean of precision
and recall this kind of mean protects
against comparatively high values of one
of these against the other the f1 score
the sways the precision and recall
equally one can use different values of
beta that gives different weights to
precision and recall much like the loss
function the choice of beta here depends
on the specific problem under
consideration we want to do a quick quiz
on your understanding of F scores in
each of the following scenarios with
choice of F 1 F 0.5 or F to be the best
choice of metric first we look at cancer
detection if someone is falsely
diagnosed we may do some extra tests if
someone who actually has cancer is not
diagnosed they may die in the box give
your appropriate choice the second
example is convicting to prison people
are innocent until proven guilty by US
law we want to avoid false convictions
but we also want criminals
not run free in this case what sort of F
score will we use</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
