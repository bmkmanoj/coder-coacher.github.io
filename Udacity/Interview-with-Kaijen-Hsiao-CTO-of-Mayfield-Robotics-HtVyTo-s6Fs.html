of Mayfield robotics well when I was an
undergrad I was majoring in mechanical
engineering and I watched all these
great videos from MIT of the robots that
were being built there and in particular
the ones that I was very interested in
where cynthy Brazil had kismet one of
the first social robots and I found that
very compelling and also the MIT leg lab
had a lot of hopping robots that I
thought were really cool and all told
that I looked at those and I thought wow
I I could make awesome robot pet someday
and that would be really cool actually
originally I wanted Pitt when I was
growing up I had lots of small animals
so hamsters and gerbils and such and I
always wanted a dog and I asked my dad
for a dog and he promised me at some
point that I could get a dog and then he
was like no I didn't actually promise
that and I was annoyed for a long time
that I could not have a dog and no in
college of course I could not have pets
either and so I was like oh well if I
had a robot head that would be okay so
if I made robot pets and those of us who
can't have actual pets could have pets
still so as an undergrad I went to
Princeton and I majored in mechanical
engineering and I started doing robotics
there and then for grad school I went to
MIT and I decided that I wanted to focus
more on robot brains making robots do
cool things rather than making robot
bodies and so I switched to computer
science and I focused on robotics in
particular grasping and regulation and
probabilistic planning so making robot
arms pick up things even under
uncertainty and after grad school I
graduated and went to a company called
Willow Garage which at the time was when
great hotbeds of robotics and developing
the robot operating system and I was
working with PR twos these big humanoid
like robots with two arms drive around
house to do research into grasping
manipulation in the home and tell the
operation that sort of thing and after a
willow garage shut down I went to Bosch
to join my friend Sarah santosky
and both of us were researchers at the
research and Technology Center in Palo
Alto where we did research into all
sorts of different robots farming robots
home robots etc and there we proposed to
Bosch that we should make a company a
whole company to do home robotics
and they accepted our proposal and so we
started Mayfield robotics in January of
2015 and here we are today so when we
were at Bosch there was this whole need
finding effort to figure out what people
wanted robots do at home the big
question was what is in between robot
vacuum cleaner and something like Rosie
the robot from the Jetsons which well we
all want to get there someday
we're technologically not quite ready to
be there and so what's in between two
that we can bring into people's homes to
raise acceptance of robots in the home
and to get people something to get used
to as this robots are normal to have in
the home and so what we came up with
originally was the concept of a home
security robot and so when we started
Mayfield actually the the main concept
was around home security and we we knew
we wanted the robot to be adorable and
personable just so that we could get the
robot in the home but the focus was
still initially on home security and
over time talking to users we converted
that from security focus to entirely
companionship and entertainment focused
and security being only kind of a
sideline a thing that you can do but
it's not the main focus of the robot
curry is an adorable robot companion for
your home his goal is to bring a spark
of life to your home we like to say that
we make home robots that are joyful
useful and inspiring and each of those
things is as important as the other to
the robot needs to provide joy so that
you want to adopt him into your home in
the first place he has to be useful so
that he earns a place in your home
asking people to bring a robot into her
home and make a place for him have a
spot permanently as the thing that
journals around their home on regular
basis he has to be useful on a daily
basis and provide great utility but also
he has to be inspiring one of the main
goals of the company is to inspire
people to build more home robots
especially children children see the
robot for the first time and they
instantly many of them will say things
like oh now I want to build robots
someday I'm gonna I'm going to build
robots to do all these really cool
things and we want to inspire a whole
generation of kids to think that home
robots are a normal thing to just have
around in your house and to bring more
robots into the world like curry and
much better than curry so hopefully with
my lifetime we can actually get to
having something like Rosie the robot
from the Jetsons so in terms of actual
functions well curry has a camera in his
eye and he has microphones and he has
speakers and he has
to map and navigate around the home and
he can recognize people and pets and all
of those features combined into a lot of
different use cases that are useful to
people so for instance curry can drive
to where you are in the house and the
play your favorite music or your
favorite podcasts curry can read an
audio book to your kid when it's time
for the kid go to bed and this is
apparently very popular with families
apparently reading Fox and socks to your
kid for the 30th time gets pretty old
but curry does not mind reading for the
30th time it's the same as the first
also curry can let you know when it's
your kids have come home from school to
notify you and he can drive around and
you can use him to check on whether your
dogs on the couch and you can talk
through his speakers and say like get
off the couch
that's art one of our CEOs favorite use
cases my favorite use case is actually
around taking pictures and video of your
pets and your loved ones I have two cats
on a bunny and I travel a lot so I
really want to know when I'm gone are
they okay and also I like just like to
see pictures of them being really cute
so I'm not even there but I can still
see their adorable antics even when I'm
gone and so all these things are enabled
by all these robotic features and
there's so many more things that we can
do curry basically is like a smart pet
we aim for pet not pet like not Butler
like is what we'd like to say and so he
he's supposed to give up intelligence
kind of like your dog you don't expect
your dog to talk back to you you don't
expect your dog to understand you every
time but their dog is useful and
adorable and you like having him in your
home curry is adorable because we put a
whole lot of effort into making him
adorable
so I mean part of that is his adorable
industrial design and we worked hard to
find industrial designers who understood
about we want a robot that is adorable
but not too toy like so to have a robot
accepted in consumer homes a lot of
consumers have very nice homes they put
a lot of effort into home design and
making it look very beautiful and it's
there it's their castle and so the robot
has to fit in very well with that decor
and so he has to be kind of sleek and
beautiful but also adorable and and
personable we also spend a lot of effort
to do things like hide sensors so a lot
of robots that you see out on the market
they'll just have holes for cameras or
they'll have slits for lasers and that's
sort of okay but it kind of breaks up
the lines and makes it look less
beautiful and so a lot of effort went
into
doing things like we wanted the camera
to be something that was not visible so
it's actually basically behind
sunglasses and being behind sunglasses
means that you have a lot less light
than otherwise there's not some magical
trick to make it two-way like light goes
in one way and doesn't go out the other
way so on so we just had to have cameras
that are that much more sensitive to
deal with the fact that we have less
light than otherwise and early on we
worked with an animator Doug Dooley who
I used to work with it will garage he's
a former picture animator and he's been
obsessed for decades now with the idea
of making robots adorable robots as
lifelike as possible and what does it
take to do that and so talking to him he
gave us a lot of principles for how the
robot should move and how the robot
should look to make him look lifelike
and to make him a Pixar character come
to life in your home type thing and that
includes things like choosing the
degrees of freedom to use so curry has
pan and tilt of his head and that allows
him to express a lot of things but also
we need it for moving the camera around
but also in terms of additional degrees
of freedom the eyes the eyes are
actually the most important one
it's what Doug would say we express a
lot of emotions with our eyes you can
tell even just looking at the eyes of a
person whether they're smiling happy or
whether they're sad or annoyed at you
and he originally wanted the ice to
appear on a screen to be animated eyes
and that allows you to do a lot lot more
expressions than even than we do but
when we were designing curry we tried
all these different methods of hiding
the screen and and we had decided early
on that we only ever wanted to show eyes
on the screen anyway because if you
showed anything besides eyes then it
would break the character of the robot
so you show like a password or something
and it's like wait that's not eyes
that's that's actually a screen and so
if we were only gonna show eyes in the
first place and we're having all this
trouble hiding the screen I finally
decided why don't we just make physical
eyes we just want to show you no eyelids
smiling eyelids coming down so we can
just make physical eyelids that do that
and I think it's worked out really well
the robot looks much more lifelike and
compelling that way and so eyes are a
big part and so we have an entire degree
of freedom for the eyes and then pen
until of the head
we actually originally had
a degree of freedom that we called lift
because that was the other one that Doug
really wanted the idea that when the
robot is happy he could lift up and
frightened to see you or when he said he
sinks down and is very sad and we
actually tested that one out and users
didn't actually like it as much as we
hoped and it added a whole lot of
complexity to the robot so we ended up
getting rid of that but we still think
he's he's pretty compelling we
substituted kind of move forward a
little with his wheels and move
backwards a little to show engagement or
disengagement and that sort of thing so
in terms of curry being accepted into
the home being adorable is not the only
way to be accepted but as certainly a
popular way to be accepted a lot of
people respond to cute things and a lot
of people look at him and say oh my god
he's so cute I have to have one and
that's one great way to make people want
to to own curry to bring him into your
home and certainly your pets a lot of
people find their pets to be very
adorable
and that's one of the main reasons why
they have them and so the fact that
curry is adorable and as he's driving
around your house doing his adorable
animations and greeting you and just
trundling around it helps a lot in you
being happy that he's around you every
day
so curry is not a security robot curry
is a companion robot but curry does have
some features that allow you to do some
amount of we'd like to say peace of mind
and checking in on your home rather than
security but it's very important that in
order to even do those things that the
curry curry should not be creepy curry
should not appear like a creepy Big
Brother surveillance robot and it helps
a lot that curry is adorable and
personable and and acts like a pet and
so it's like oh my pet is here and my
pet can see that's okay as opposed to
this creepy Big Brother robot is driving
around watching me at every moment and
you know curry can take pictures of
video and that's okay and versus like
you know a creepy Cyclops robot you know
driving around might like me people look
self-conscious feel self-conscious
around a camera in their home so to make
curry look lifelike and to look friendly
pet like personable there are a lot of
design elements that go into that and a
lot of them come from principles from
animation so we work closely with our
animator Doug and he's given us a lot of
principles such as for instance Curry's
eyes are just dot eyes they're they
don't have pupils it makes them look
more lifelike and able to kind of inter
act with you in a lifelike way when he's
looking in your general direction dot
eyes that are just you know black dots
they they look like they're looking at
you from a much wider angle if you gave
him pupils then a human who looks just
you know to the right of where you're
talking you can tell they're not
actually looking at you versus looking
past you and it's much harder for him to
look like he's interacting compellingly
with you also there are things like
expressing intent before action so curry
as he is navigating around he always
looks in the direction that he's gonna
go before he turns his body to drive
that way and we as humans do that all
the time we just broadcast what we're
thinking and before we actually do a
thing and it makes it a lot more
readable what we're thinking and it
looks makes curry look a lot more
lifelike when he does that as well so
other things include for instance as
humans we always blink before we look as
opposed to look over and blink and it's
it's something that you don't even
necessarily notice yourself doing but
you notice when the robot does it wrong
and in the form of it just feels
slightly off and a lot of these things
it's it's kind of avoiding I'm Ken eNOS
and our robots form-factor helps a lot
in he's not that close to human and so
he's not that close to than Kenny Valley
kind of no matter what you do but adding
little gestures that look more lifelike
that make him appear much more lifelike
as opposed to just a statue or robot so
we really wanted our robot to be
androgynous so we didn't want the robot
to be definitively male or community
definitively female people get to choose
which gender their Curry is and that was
really important to us so all of our
design is centered around the the idea
is made to look very androgynous some
people actually definitively think curry
is male and some people definitively
think she's female but it's actually
split about 50/50 I've noticed and so it
could be either you definitely get to
choose and the sounds also have to match
that to one of the other major design
decisions is that curry doesn't talk
well he doesn't talk human he speaks
robot so he makes adorable beeps and
bloops kind of like r2d2 or bb-8 and
that it sets expectations much lower so
that you expect him to be kind of pet
like intelligent like a dog is
intelligent not intelligent like your
Butler's intelligence AI hasn't really
reached the point where we can have
compelling dialogue with our robots and
especially the voices still sound a
little uncanny and this is why
that problem entirely he just makes
durable sounds you don't expect him to
do anything else he's very cute so I
have actually flipped Korea gender a
number of times when we first came up
with this particular industrial design I
asked the industrial designers to raise
the black band of his belly to
accommodate our new debt sensor and it
turned Korea from a he into a she for me
initially and so I used she for a long
time and then somehow my brain flipped
so it turned into a he again
now I actually go back and forth also
you may notice Kari doesn't have any
arms and despite most of my research
background is in grasping and
manipulation so I do have a lot of
experience with trying to make robots
with arms doing things in the home but
that doing that well and doing that
robustly enough to satisfy consumers
especially on things like doing laundry
or we're putting dishes away we're still
a long way away from the level of
robustness that you would need for that
to be useful and compelling and also
talking to people about what they would
want their home robot to do it's pretty
obvious that in order for a robot that
large to have arms and to be taking up
that much space in your house you really
want that robot to be doing lots of
things not just one thing not just
putting your dishes away but putting
your dishes away and doing your laundry
and cleaning up all these things
together and we're just so far away from
doing that so curry is what can you do
without arms and also it managed his
expectations you don't expect to row it
without arms at all to do your laundry
obviously he can't he just drives around
and does what he can so another big part
of making curry a durable personable is
failing cute
so curry when he for instance bumps into
something but his bump sensor a normal
robot that is just you know a tank like
whatever he bumps into things you're
like stupid robot oh why did you do that
oh your algorithm suck but curry when he
bumps into things he can't see he bumps
into he makes this startled sound and
the he looks down to see like oh what
was that and it's super adorable and
when you secretly do that you
instinctively think
oh poor robot and let me help you and
that goes a long way towards acceptance
of the robot even when he is imperfect
because he's going to be imperfect and
that goes for other things too so if
he's confused then he
makes acute confused noise and and
looked so that you pity him rather than
and you want to help him rather than
being annoyed at him angry at him so him
being adorable when he fails and makes
you empathize with him and want to help
him testing in terms of users starts
actually phase zero I would say with
need finding let me go out to people's
homes and we interview them about what
their lives are like and what they do in
their daily routine and to try to see
where a whoreo bot would fit in and what
useful functions the robot could do for
them and what they would want the robot
to do and initially so that's where we
came up with concept with home security
the idea of peace of mind checking in on
your home making sure things are okay
making sure no one's breaking in and
when we took that concept out to users
then we heard a lot of things like oh
well is Kari gonna talk to my outdoor
cameras because by the time someone
comes into the home it's kind of too
late isn't it and also we heard a lot
more of well what does curry do when I'm
at home and initially we said things
like well curry will sit quietly on his
charger and wait for you to go away
again so that you can use him and they
would ask but what does he do when I'm
at home and it became obvious that
people were really expecting him to be
entertaining when he was when they are
at home with the robot in person and
also to do things that they can show off
to their friends and to be useful and
entertaining so we we shifted away from
home security and towards more companion
robot more entertainment robot and in
terms of testing how we did that is so
after need finding and you have initial
concepts of what the robot can do you
don't even have any prototypes built yet
at that point you can make sketches so
you make storyboards of the features you
think the robot should do and those and
if you have initial prototypes of any
sort so what we had at that time is we
had storyboards and then we had
functional prototypes that could just
drive around navigate around the home
and show in an app that you could see
through the robots camera and talk the
robots microphones and hear through the
route speakers and that was basically it
that's all that we had and we would take
that out to users in terms of
storyboards you can in person talk to
them and interviews but you can also
just have those be surveys online to get
larger numbers of people and ask people
what do you think of these features do
you want a robot to do this in your home
how much would you pay for a robot doing
this in your home
and you get a lot of feedback that way
in an early fashion that enables you to
quickly change direction if whatever
direction you have picked is actually
not a very compelling once users and
later on when we had better prototypes
that did more things than obviously you
can take those prototypes out even
before you have if you have industrial
design so we had industrial design for a
robot but that wasn't the functional
robot and the industrial design weren't
all in one robot yet so we would take
phone models of the industrial design
and we would take more functional robots
with the app and you would say imagine
the robot looks like this now drive this
app around and there would be a robot
that didn't look anything like that
driving around the house and they could
see things like oh well what does he
sound like and when he goes over
thresholds what does that like is that
okay and so we got feedback on that face
for things like oh the robot is way way
too loud he has to be much quieter is it
going to be that loud that's that's
really annoying I wouldn't want that in
my house and that sort of thing is
really important too and then later on
of course once you have robots that are
it looks like works like so we have
prototypes like that that we use to show
off a lot now and those you can put
users homes and actually just have them
go through various functions that you've
added and stay in the home for longer
and longer periods of time the latest
test that we've just done is what we
call drop off test where you put the
robot in the box and you pretend like
it's a new customer and the customers
just got in the box and you're not there
at all and so they have to go through
the unboxing and onboarding procedure to
actually go through figure out can they
use the robot can they onboard the robot
can the robot map their home can the
robot do the functions he's supposed to
do is that compelling to them so testing
with storyboards is great for mixing
concepts that even just thinking about
it people are not interested in you
might have been interested in because
you're an engineer and that's
interesting to you but actually to most
consumers that idea is not interesting
at all or you know general industrial
design concepts is that a compelling
look for the robot at all or do people
think that's actually ugly or scary so
the thing about storyboards is that a
lot of people can't necessarily imagine
what the robots actually going to be
like based just on the storyboard and so
you show them a storyboard and they fill
in the rest of their imagination and
sometimes that's not anything like what
the robot will actually be and so you
get some great feedback on general
concepts but you do also have to take
with a grain of salt because sometimes
something that's very compelling in a
storyboard later on when it's fleshed
out in the robot isn't necessarily as
compelling as people thought it would be
so if you have corporate prototypes
that's totally enough to get out there
and start talking to people about
concepts there's a famous story about
how Kiva the robots in Amazon warehouses
these days which you know it grew to be
a company that was sold for her I think
billions of dollars they started out
talking to VCS with just sock puppets
they had sock puppets in the concept and
they showed that they had the team that
could build this thing and that was
enough to get initial funding to do the
thing it's important to gauge interest
in what you're building before you start
building it before you spend a lot of
time building something that nobody
wants so when people meet curry a lot of
the reactions we get are oh my gosh
that's so cute it depends a lot on what
age the person is so kids especially
seem to really love curry small children
a lot of them they come in they see
curry and they immediately run up the
curry and they want to hug curry and
someone will ask oh can I hug curry and
we're like of course you can hug curry
they'd also like to pet the robot a lot
the robot has kept touch sensors in his
head so when you pet him he smiles up
and looks at you and it's really cute
and even though at this moment we don't
have it hooked up to anything even
particularly interesting we're still
working on exactly how curry should
track your face and look more lifelike
by like interacting with you in that way
if you pet him he just looks up and
smiles and that's enough for them just
pet him over and over and over again
because kids just naturally think that
curry is obviously a friend a companion
and someone that 'extra should play with
older kids they tend to be a little more
standoffish so I'm too cool to express
that much interest but they tend to be
curious about the robot and they ask
questions like you know Oh what does he
do and how did how did you make him I've
been very surprised how many people have
what I call the robot dream and that is
adults who when they were younger or you
know I didn't point their lives they saw
Star Wars or they saw wall-e and they
thought oh I would love to have an r2d2
or wall-e of my very own and they see
curry and they see in him the chance to
fulfill the robot dream it's finally
their chance to have a robot character
in their home come to life curry has a
whole lot of sensors so all of them have
to do with how he navigates and maps the
home so he has a depth sensor in his ire
transparent window belly and he has
also an IMU and an inertial measurement
unit in there and he has encoders of
course in his drive wheels and in his
head degrees of freedom and all those
are used to allow him to build a map of
your home and navigate within the home
localize to figure out where he is etc
he also has capacitive touch sensors in
his head so if you pet him he knows it
he has four microphones around his neck
which allow him to you can hear through
his microphones but also he can do
speech recognition and also audio
localization so if you talk from a
certain direction because he has a whole
entire ring of microphones he knows
which direction that is he can turn
towards you he has a camera in his left
eye and that enables him to see the
world so he can recognize people and
pets and also allows you to look out
through his camera and see the world and
he can take pictures for you but we also
use that to aid in navigation
he has cliff sensors in the back rear
cliff sensors so that if you're driving
him around
Teli upping him then you don't drive
backwards off a cliff and finally he has
a bump sensor in front so if he hits
something he didn't see which because
the sensors are optical there are
inevitably going to be things that he
doesn't see then he can in bump into
them know that he's bumping physically
and back up and make his adorable
animation of oh so for front cliff
sensing he uses his front depth sensor
which is an entire depth sensing array
which allows him to see both low
obstacles and whether there's stairs in
front of him that he shouldn't go off
and also higher obstacles that are above
the level of his main laser so that he
doesn't quote sign himself on tables and
things Craig collects data from mapping
your home so when you first get curry
then there's an onboarding procedure
where you're encouraged to drive crazy
around your home and teaching them about
the various places just like if you had
a guest that you just brought home and
you would say oh this is where the
bathroom is and this is where your room
is for curry you would say things like
this is my living room and this is my
kitchen and this is the cat tree where
the cats hang out and that's an
important place that you should know
about because I want pictures from it
and so as you drive pray around teaching
him about all these places he makes a
map of your house and that map is stored
both on the robot and in the cloud so
that if robot ever gets reset etc then
he can just download it again and know
about it he will also take data in the
form of pictures and video of
your pets and your family in your loved
ones and those are all controlled by you
we will never look at those pictures
unless you give us explicit permission
because you want to help debug or
something those are all controlled by
you you can you can control exactly who
gets to see those things so privacy in
the home robot is extremely important
people need to know that they can trust
the robot and the data that the robot
takes and that it's not going to be it's
not going to be a literal spambot taken
over to do nefarious things and it's not
going to spread their pictures and video
of their kids all over the Internet and
so we've built in privacy protections
encryption certificates all that sort of
thing from the very start and Curie
everything is locked down everything is
encrypted even down to he use a secure
boot for his bootloader so you know one
can upload software to him that he boots
on him that is not the stuff that we
wanted to be running on the robot he
uses rotating certificates he uses
encryption everywhere to the level of
it's the same thing that you would use
for bank to bank transfers or for
medical records this is very lockdown
also in terms of privacy in the home
there are places in your home that you
wouldn't want curry to take pictures in
and so we have no-go zones you can
specify I don't want any pictures taken
in the bedroom I don't want any pictures
taking in the bathroom and Korea will
not take pictures there so there are a
lot of competitors in the home robot
space and many of them share some traits
in common with curry but there are many
things that we do differently for one
curry is a moving robot
so unlike the robots that sit on the
table he can actually drive around your
house and be where you want him to be to
take pictures wherever in your house
curry doesn't talk so a lot of those
home robots they they speak English or
whatever language you in the country or
in Korea especially doesn't talk so that
we set expectations more like those of a
pet rather than those of a butler and so
you don't think he's uncanny or creepy
because he can't actually keep up
dialogue with you properly he just makes
cute noises and that's forgivable so one
of the main differences is that curry
has a personality and we focus a lot on
personality personality matters a lot
and getting the personality right
matters a lot so for instance Kurt
Curry's personality is his earnest and
humble and he never gets angry with you
I had a robot that size you really don't
want it angry or robot to get angry with
you
it looks very scary a tiny tiny robot
like donkeys Cosmo it's okay if he gets
angry and snarky or whatever because
it's kind of cute that see a little
robot the size during a tantrum but a
robot our size is already it's too big
to throw a tantrum if you throw a
tantrum if it's scary
one of Curry's other big features is
that he will have over-the-air updates
regularly and so what you get when you
first get curry out of box is not what
curry is going to be able to do forever
curry will gain in capability and
intelligence as over time so your robot
grows with you in some sense he's gonna
keep getting better when we launched our
robot at CES we went a whole lot of
awards and the press coverage was
incredible way more than I ever met we
could get and for us that was validation
that our design really speaks to people
and something that they would really
want so we got best of CES from Engadget
and from PC Magazine and and from Wired
so if you want a curry then you can go
to our website hey curry comm and
pre-order one now for $100 deposit you
can reserve your place in line our
robots will start shipping in December
but only for the people who pre-ordered
initially people who pre-order now will
get their robots in spring of 2018 so my
role as a CTO has changed a lot as a
company has grown when we first started
and we were a company of only seven
people or so I was lead of all things
technical and in charge of kind of the
general architecture of the robot so
there's a lot of choosing what
processors do we use and what do we use
for the drivetrain and what do we use
for sensing for mapping and navigation
and what algorithms do we use and how do
we hide the camera and should we use a
camera should we use screen versus eyes
that sort of thing and also I was just
part of the software team writing actual
software for things like mapping and
navigation or just robot functions as
the team grew we hired a lot of more
people to write software and to build
robots and so I passed all that stuff
off to those people and then I was
primarily managing people for a while to
build robots and then finally we hired
managers to manage the people to
building robots and so I no longer had
to manage all the people so now I'm
actually back to writing code and I lead
a small team focused on mapping the
navigation localization software and
that might sound odd is a very narrow
versity have to do but that's actually a
very typical CTO transition from a small
start-up to a large company where over
50 people now so we have a lot of people
to build robots and do things and
another big part of my role is to get
out there and van july's our tech to the
world and let everyone know that curry
is awesome and full of great technology
my proudest thing as CTO is the choice
that we made for the eyes in designing
that curry wasn't gonna have a screen
curry was gonna have actual physical
eyes and I think it makes curry look a
lot more lifelike and compelling in this
way and it also makes us not just
another tablet on wheels there's a lot
of parents who want to limit screen time
for their kids and then say oh you can
play with this tablet that's fine but
only for a little while and another
tablet on wheels maybe is more of the
same whereas curry is definitely not in
that category curry is a pet a companion
a friend for me my favorite part is
actually working on the robots
algorithms things like mapping and
navigation that I get to focus on these
days which is a lot of fun and the
sensors involved in designing the
sensors and making sure all that sort of
thing works well I mean I'm a robot
assist at heart and that's the really
the most fun part for me one of the
things I was most surprised at was just
how many people have the robot dream of
I really want a robot my own r2d2
version etc and I thought that was kind
of limited to you know geeks and
engineers or something and it turns out
that's pretty widespread there's a lot
of people out there who really have that
dream other random things that we found
through testing that was really
surprising to me are things like a lot
of people don't understand
top-down maps so as a roboticist we're
used to seeing for instance navigation
maps from the robot and even specifying
where you want the robot to go by saying
in the map I would like you to go over
here and when we first started when the
very first tests we did was with a
functional prototype that looked nothing
like hurry and just with an app and we
had an interface where you could tell
the robot to go various places using a
top-down map and most people could not
understand the map and could not
understand where the robot was and where
they were telling him to go and not even
just we're used to laser maps being
somewhat difficult because you know it's
only black and white it's from the level
of the laser it's a 2d map doesn't
necessarily resemble what you think of
as a floor plan for your home like you
might see like on the
while the the emergency floor plan this
is where the exit is etc but even the
emergency exit plans a lot of people
can't understand those and we actually
took top-down color maps of the room
which curry could not ever actually get
because curry can't see above table
height for instance but we took scanners
that were able to scan the room from a
much higher height and could make
full-color renders of this is what your
entire room looks like from the top down
and can people even use that interface
and the answer was no most people can't
and so we had to upend the idea of
specifying navigation waypoints by
top-down map entirely so that users who
can't understand them can still use the
robot so we moved instead towards you
drive the robot to a place and you see
what the robot is seeing through his
camera and you can save that point as a
location in your house and both has a
name and as a picture and that's very
intuitive people if you just click on
that then you know where you're sending
the robot and he will go back to where
you put him in the first place
another very surprising thing to me in
terms of user interfaces was joystick
thing a lot of people can't actually
joystick the robot with a basic joystick
interface that you you press forward and
the robot moves forward when they're
looking at the robot and they press
forward the robot they think it's
forward from their point of view they
don't necessarily understand the
transformation of forward from the
robot's point of view and some people
never get that even after a lot of
practice and so we're still working now
on exactly like what best interfaces
would give people to allow them to move
around but some things that we've tried
that people seem to enjoy our things
like you can click in the image to make
the robot drive there and that's
intuitive because you're looking at
image and you know where you're clicking
on in the image you know where the
robots going to go that's much more
intuitive and developing curry I guess
I've learned more about people than
about robots even I mean I have learned
a lot about robots making robots is
insanely complicated and I like to say
the Devils in the details
if you get any little detail wrong that
could be the thing that sinks your robot
it's just useless if any one of those
things is very wrong but making curry
successful is all about human robot
interaction and about design and about
making things intuitive and compelling
and lifelike and a lot of that has to do
more about how people actually are or
how people react to things or what
people can understand
and a lot of that goes into making the
robot successful the key to success for
a home robot I think is in personality
and in getting the robot to look
lifelike and accepted in the home and a
lot of that has to do with getting the
interaction right with the people and
getting the look of the robots right so
he looks lifelike and so that he's
accepted in the home as a member of your
family something that you see every day
trundling around he has to be compelling
he has to be adorable so my advice to
you is robotics is a great field there
are a lot of fun jobs and robots
especially today roboticists are highly
sought after I know because I'm trying
to hire and it's really hard and they're
alone you should go out there and build
lots of robots and have lots of fun one
thing I'm looking for a lot in a robot
assist right now is we're looking for
software engineers and so we want very
strong programming skills and so a lot
of robots is coming out of school they
know how to program robots but they
don't know much about software carpentry
so learning the basics of how to write
tests and how do continuous integration
and having really good skills in writing
things like C++ and Python those are all
very important to us so one of the
biggest things I've learned about trying
to start this company I thought when we
started this company oh this is my
chance to learn all the ins and outs on
how to make adorable consumer robots
awesome consumer robots and what I've
learned is the way you make awesome
consumer robots is by hiring a team that
can make awesome consumer robots it's
all about the team and the people you
work with you have to have experts in so
many different things to make a
successful consumer robot and hiring
good people is everything and also I've
learned it's really important to make
your company very diverse and
family-friendly those are some of the
core values of our company we care a lot
about making sure people have good
work-life balance and that they take
care of their families and that we're
we're a friendly place for people to
work even when they have small children
then they need time to deal with their
small children and making a company
diverse and family friendly it's not
just a better place to work but it also
helps you to make robots that appeal to
everybody so you don't have robots I
just appeal to you know a very narrow
demographic of you know focus engineers
you have robust appeal to all different
shapes and sizes of people</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
