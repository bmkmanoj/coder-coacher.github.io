going to explore that through an example
l1 is uppercase L 1 is lowercase L 1
comma comp 1 and similarly L 2 is
lowercase label l2 is lowercase L 2
which is the level sensitivity level of
label 2 comma comp 2 okay so the
comparison is going to yield what we
call you know what label dominates the
other label okay so l1 can dominate l2
or l2 can be or l-1 can be dominated by
l2 or maybe neither one dominates the
other ones so these are the various
possibilities so l1 label l1 is going to
dominate label l2 if level 1 is greater
than level 2 and the categories or the
topics that make up compartment 1 in 10
the topics or categories that are in
compartment too so essentially we saying
l1 is God is going to dominate if it's
higher sensitive level and the
categories actually are a superset or
contain the categories of compartment to
if it's dominated then it's the other
way okay so in that case label l2 is the
dominating one so obviously level l2 has
to be greater than level at one and the
containment that we had before has to be
in the other direction okay so this is
the the subset relation that we have
here for the two labels to be equal of
course each part has to be the same so
the levels have to the same and the
compartments have do the same so if l1
and l2 are not comparable and what do we
mean by that that means it's one of the
first three they're not equal and
neither one dominates the other one then
we say that you know they're not
comparable l1 doesn't dominate l2 l1 is
not dominated by l2 and the reason for
that is we're talking about a label
having two parts so levels are obviously
totally ordered so you cannot be no
you're not compatible it's not because
you know the the levels that you have
within your label l1 and l2 it's
actually going to be because the
compartments are sets and these heads
are going to be neither one is going to
be contained in other one so they are
they each had some elements
the other one doesn't have and because
of that this containment property is not
going to be satisfied and because of
that neither of these are going to be
holding and when they don't then we say
that these labels are not comparable so
one thing I you know if you take these
labels and arrange them sort of what
kind of structure you get mathematics
actually the name for that structure
it's going to form a lattice and when
you have a lattice you have the elements
that are the list upper bound and the
greatest lower bound and things like
that so you can always find labels you
know that would dominate any set of
labels that you have so that would be
you know finding an upper bound and you
can find the smallest such upper bound
so that's lu b and things like that so
when you compare these instead of
arranged and what's dominated by who we
get the structure because of the partial
and the total order we have on the
different parts the structure you get is
what is called a lattice</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
