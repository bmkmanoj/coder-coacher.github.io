were talking about last time we were
talking about the iterated prisoner's
dilemma and here's the prisoner's
dilemma payoffs that you wrote down for
us do you remember this I vaguely
remember this and remember it was about
these two criminals smooth and curly and
they were deciding whether to cooperate
or defect against each other when after
they've been arrested right and they
defect they always defect they always
defect right so in particular we said
well what happens if it's if they have
multiple rounds in which to interact and
so here they are here the two of them
and if they got one round to live we did
an analysis and we indicated that
there's really nothing they can do other
than defect against each other it just
is irrational to do anything else yep so
we said all right well what happens if
we allow there to be more than one round
so now we've got two rounds and what we
realized was that if you've got two
rounds to go then these players
essentially face a one round game
because after this round what they're
going to do in the last round has
already been determined so it's almost
as if that round doesn't really matter
there's nothing we can do now that's
gonna change what they're gonna do in
that last round so it's sort of like
there's just one round and we're going
to defect again right so life is
terrible and everyone is out to get
everyone else exactly and not only is it
for two rounds but this same argument
continues as you go three rounds or more
oh it's like a proof by induction it's
kind of like a proof by induction
yeah it's proof by ellipsis mmm that's
my favorite kind of induction proof by
ellipsis II so the question then becomes
what happens if the number of rounds
left is unknown right so what we realize
is that if you know how many rounds are
left the whole thing comes unraveled and
they're just going to defect forever but
we raise the issue of what happens if
the number of rounds left is unknown and
it seems like it shouldn't really make
any difference because if it's a some
finite number we just don't know what it
is then it seems like it should just
still reduce to the same setup that we
have so I was looking into this and it
turns out that is it's not the case it
actually does make a difference and it's
it's really interesting how it goes and
how it connects back with other things
we've talked about woo tell me more</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
