just notice everything we end up using
one of the first things we do is call
the function right and its argument is
based on calling the function factorial
of 5 so and we have to get up here and
start determining if n is equal to 0 so
function calls are definitely critical
to getting the output to this test case
correct one of the first things we have
to do is look up and see if n is equal
to 0 and will change from 5 24 23 22 21
20 depending on which environment frame
were in we will definitely end up doing
environment lookups if we can't do them
we don't know what the value of n is so
we're going to start getting this wrong
eventually as time goes by we are
comparing n 20 we're multiplying end by
the result of this function call and
we're subtracting 1 for men those are
all binary operators the Equality check
the multiplication and the subtraction
those are all binary operator
expressions so we are testing at least
some of our binary operators but for the
rest of these elements of our
interpreter we're not testing them
explicitly even though we end up calling
right there are no string constants the
word here constant is very important
like hello in this program you could
argue that we're building up a dynamic
string 120 but that's not a string
constant there are also no local
variable declarations a local variable
declaration is different from a
functions formal parameter and this
matters because we're trying to find
bugs in our interpreter code since we
have different Python code to handle
parameters than we do for local variable
declarations if we mistakenly think
they're the same thing we'll have more
confidence in our program than we should
we might miss bugs so we're not testing
this sort of thing VAR temp equals 2
that's a local variable declaration we
don't see anything like that over here
finally assignment statements there are
no assignment statements in this program
now we'll end up associating with n the
value 5 or 4 or 3 or two or one but
that's handled by our function call code
we don't see anything like this x equals
2 in this input so we're not testing it
so while this is a good test case and it
checks many things it does not give us
confidence that we've exercised every
feature of our interpreter we need a few
more tests
is to do that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
