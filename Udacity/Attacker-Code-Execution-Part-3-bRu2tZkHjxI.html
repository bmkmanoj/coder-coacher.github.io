provide when this string is read we know
that if we provide more than 12 bytes
we're going to overflow in this
direction into these variables as you're
talking about so what can you do if you
sort of are careful about it first thing
that we want to do is we want program
control to go someplace where our code
the attacker can actually craft some
code there are two things that hacker
has to do it has to have its code that
it wants to run and then it has to find
a way to get the program control
transfer to happen such that the program
goes and starts executing the code that
the attacker has crafted here we should
sort of look at this and say there is an
opportunity here for that hacker the
attacker has found a way to go up and
right into these locations we know that
it has done that because if it passes
more than 12 bytes these four bytes are
going to be overwritten that's a low
login if it writes more than 16 bytes
then the return address is going to be
written so if you carefully sort of
overflow and you can find out the return
address where our code is and the all
flow actually ends up writing the
address of that code into this return
address what would happen in that case
the function when it's done will not
return to where it came from
remember it had stored the address where
it needs to go back in return address
but why carefully sort of overflowing
and modifying this return address that
all return addresses history it's gone
it's going to actually return to the
address that we have inserted or we have
put in these four bytes the four bytes
where we have the new address that we
have put into this area of memory where
we had the return address before that's
where this program is going to return so
this is kind of an aha moment by
providing bad input the vulnerability is
we're going to know that we're not
checking input that's the vulnerability
that is what is getting exploited by
that hacker the attacker is providing a
carefully crafted input and when we take
that input an overflow occurs and the
way the whole flow reaches that it
address area the part of memory where
the return address is stored we are
actually going to put a new return
address where code that we have created
by V I mean the attacker the program
will start executing that code so some
code the attacker wants executed if you
know where that code is and we know its
address and this is what we overwrite
these four locations with the return
address by passing bad input exploiting
the vulnerability when the program
doesn't check its input like passing
carefully-crafted input we are now able
to take the program from where it was to
a place where our instructions are
located</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
