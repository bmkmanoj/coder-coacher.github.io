that function to our program here and
actually this one works verbatim just
like out of the quiz now if we give it a
list of points at will return the URL
for the image and let's go ahead and use
that we have any coordinates make a URL
image we've already implemented that
function let's go ahead and move our
comment and now we just need to display
the image URL actually we need to make
one little change here image URL equals
none it by default doesn't exist and if
we actually have some points we can set
it something else and then we just need
to pass image URL into our template
image URL equals image URL and now we
just need to update our template and
we're going to insert our image remember
this is this is our template I had a
bunch of CSS remember I explained that
kind of controls the layout of things
and then we have all of our HTML and
here's our form and we want to display
this to the right of our form I'm going
to do some things you haven't seen
before in terms of getting it to display
right but first let's just get the image
in here if image URL so basically if
it's not none include our image and this
is how we we do that in this in the
Ginga template language again I know we
haven't covered this in this class but
it's fairly straightforward you just
have some some text and you have these
little escapes for actually running
Python code if the URL is there include
this image and let's give this a whirl I
reloaded the page and you can see below
the form we have an image with with a
marker on it pretty cool huh let's get
our image displayed off to the right
here I'm just going to go ahead and do
that and I'll explain briefly how it's
done okay so I've moved the image over
here I'll show you briefly what I did to
do that i added a class to map so i can
refer to it in my CSS you can use this
notion of position absolute which allows
you to position something anywhere on
the page so I positioned absolute the
map to be 0 pixels from the right and
112 pixels from the top duo from the
right 112 from the top it fits perfectly
obviously I knew the size of the image
beforehand when we did this whole URL
thing let's see if our program remember
we've got this hack in here forcing our
IP we're going to have to probably if we
going to develop this long-term maybe
when it's in debug mode it'll choose
from some random IPS or something like
that but when we put in a production
it's going to use the real IP right now
we're just going to hard code some IP so
this actually works in the demo okay
i'll go ahead and clued Udacity office
IP and we'll submit some ascii art will
have this IP and let's make sure things
work let's add a picture of a rabbit
will paste that in or will draw up a
hand which over your faster at and we
submit this tada took a little longer to
smick is we had to look up the IP but
now we can see that we use our office IP
just down here in Palo Alto and we have
our old IP from that other IP we fates
which is in here in the Colorado and we
can see our rabbit and our cat and our
camel didn't have a location and so now
ASCII Chan is much more worldly I'll put
this online at ASCII Chan calm and you
all can submit all the ASCII art you'd
love to do we'll see how this map code
that's it for this lesson I hope you
learned something about how to interact
with other websites good luck on the
homeworks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
