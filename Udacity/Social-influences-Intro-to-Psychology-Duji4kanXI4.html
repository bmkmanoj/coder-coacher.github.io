occur they are informational social
influence and normative social influence
let's start with the informational
social influence this happens when
people conform to the behavior of others
because they view the other people as a
source of knowledge regarding what
they're supposed to do or how they're
supposed to act have you ever found
yourself in a new situation and we're
unsure of how to act or what to do did
you look to others to see how they were
behaving well this is an example of
informational social influence consider
a freshman starting college the person
may look around to see how other people
are behaving in the lunchroom for
example two people take their food
author trays to eat do they keep their
food on their trays do they mostly sit
outside do they sit inside this usually
happens in situations that are ambiguous
or in a novel situation that's when
we're most likely to see the
informational social influence occur the
next influence on our behavior will be
quite obvious when you stop and think
about some examples in your own life
this is normative social influence and
it explains a lot of our behavior for
example do you dress similar to lead to
your friends to listen the same type of
music as your friends have you ever
tried drugs or alcohol to be accepted by
a particular social group well if you've
changed your behavior in order to gain
acceptance by a particular social group
social psychologists would say that this
is due to normative social influence</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
