in the top left I use the l Junction up
here to look at the el constraint which
said that both 5 and 1 are blades I
didn't use W junction right here to look
at the w constraint and find that these
should be labeled as blade fold and
blade from one two and three I noticed
that the L constraint and the W
constraint for these two junctions both
made this edge a blade and that followed
around for the entire figure whenever
one Junction said that a certain edge
was of certain type like blade all the
other junctions that were connected to
that edge said the same thing so in the
center for example the Y constraint here
would say that to 6 and 7 are all folds
and indeed to 6 and 7 all play the role
of folds with regard to the W
constraints here here and here that's
good David note that David sat on the
top left corner this was a random
selection he couldn't cited at any other
corner for example just one of that one
and found the same answer and that is
because we have simplified these
constraints but now that we know that
this line is a fold by the definition of
a fold we know that two surfaces must be
meeting at this line it follows then
that this must be a surface and this
must be a surface similarly because we
know this is a fold and by definition of
a fold two surfaces must be meeting here
it follows and this is a surface and
this as a surface and so on and now we
have identified that this is one surface
this is another surface this is a third
surface in this way the visual system
used knowledge the different kind of
junctions in the world of private or
objects and it constrains at each of
those junctions to figure out which of
these lines made surfaces instead of
thinking of this is one single surface
the visual system identified this has
been composed of three different
surfaces and now we can recognize that
this might be a cue</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
