it's not all the building will be hit
before our object is it's got to be
conducting if it is in conducting well
no charge will flow through it and it
will be pretty difficult to entice
lightning to strike our object and
finally it's got to be grounded we've
got to disperse all of this electrical
charge in energy somehow and the way
we're going to do that is by dumping it
into the earth into the ground and so
there you have it we've basically solved
the problem so let's get a professor
fragrant a say one more time and see
what he has to say Franklin's original
idea was to discharge clouds as there is
an effect called the effect of points
points of the property of discharging
electricity so this was Franklin's the
idea did it was put in practice and but
it doesn't work this way it catches the
light thing so to say these the current
explanation is a bit complicated it
produces modifications of the electrical
field and then it is important that it
conveys the electricity through a
conductor avoiding the circuit through
the bending it conveys the electricity
to the earth so it is discharged
discharger to the earth the earth
receives the electricity of lightning
because it is a very big body and so it
can receive the
an extra amount of electricity at the
time of Benjamin Franklin it was thought
as a sort of general receiver of
electricity so there you have it we've
invented the lightning rod good work and
all the lightning rod is is a large
conducting pole place near building or
on top of the building with a wire
running along the side and it must be
properly grounded and what happens is
when a storm cloud comes overhead it
draws but we can think of it as drawing
positive charge up really what it's
doing is forcing negative charge into
the earth but it creates a really strong
electric field in this region and the
lightning instead of striking the house
will strike our pole and life is good no
more buildings get burned down amazing
good work venture in Franklin and could
work to you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
