finish we need a test condition for the
while and in this case we really want to
keep on going forever until we're done
so we're gonna use while true and then
use break to stop the loop so the test
condition is true and the way we know
when we're done is when the value
returned as the URL was none that means
we got to the else so to finish we need
to finish the else block by using break
so now let's test our code so we'll call
print all links with our test string
that has test1 test2 and test3 has three
links and when we run this what we see
as it prints out the three links test1
test2 and test3 we'll try a more
interesting test so for a more
interesting example let's go back to the
webpage we looked at earlier this was
the page with a flying Python comic and
it has many links in it and we saw when
we did view source we can see what those
links look like so the first link that
we see in the page so if you use command
F we can search for the first link in
the page so we see that we have these
links the first one is the link to
archive and that corresponds to what we
see here at the top of the page here's
the link to archive the link to blag the
link to the store and about informs and
so there's a lot of links in this page
if we go back to our print all links
code we can try to print them all so
first let's look at what we actually see
when we do get page passing in the URL
of xkcd calm 3:53 which is the page we
were looking at and when we run this we
see a lot of text printed out and that's
exactly what we saw from view source but
now that's what we're getting as a
result from get page that's the text of
the webpage not very easy to look at
let's instead of using get page will
print all the links in the page instead
of just printing the whole page out so
now we're using our print all links
procedure to print all the links in the
xkcd page and when we run this we indeed
see all the links in the page at least
we see most of them
there are a few that we miss and we'll
talk about that in a later unit but
we're seeing many of the links in the
page including the first ones that we
saw with the archive and the blog and
the store link and we're seeing lots of
other links and you can see that we go
all the way to the Buttercup festival
link and a license link those are the
two at the bottom of the page this is
the link to license which was the last
one that we printed out so
congratulations are in order
you've made it to the end of unit two
and I hope you understand the main
concepts we've seen so far in unit 1 we
saw variables we learned about programs
we saw how to do arithmetic in unit 2 we
learned about making procedures and we
learned how to use if to make decisions
and we saw that those by themselves was
enough to do every possible computer
program as Alan Turing showed in the
1930s we also learned about while loops
a way to make it more convenient to do
things over again and now we've actually
got a really good start on our search
engine we can print all the links in a
page we still don't have our web crawler
we need to actually collect those links
and do something with them that's what
we're going to do in unit 3 and then in
unit 4 5 &amp;amp; 6 we'll see how to use the
corpus that we've built to do useful web
searches but we've come a long way and I
hope we'll see you back soon for unit 3</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
