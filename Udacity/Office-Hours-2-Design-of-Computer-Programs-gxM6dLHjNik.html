hours again we had a lot of really good
questions in the forum so let's get
started all right what's the first
question first question came from
Matthew Atkinson and he has heard that
you shouldn't use functions like eval
and exec which we did use in unit 2 so
he wants to know why shouldn't we be
using these functions and what's the
problem with them okay yeah that's a
great question and there's a couple
reasons to avoid these one is for
security especially if you're going to
be a vowing string that somebody passes
into you you don't know what it's going
to be doing and there's lots of
dangerous commands that Python can
execute like delete all my files and you
don't want to be asking somebody to type
something in and then go execute that
and allow them to do something dangerous
so that's one reason and then the other
is just in terms of program structure
that we like to write our programs so
that the functions and variables and so
on have a set scope is that this
variable exists from here to here and
eval kind of breaks all that structure
and goes outside of it and says now
we're executing something right here but
it's not executing with respect to where
we are in the code it's executing
someplace completely different and that
makes it harder to follow the code so
nothing wrong in terms of do you get the
right answer but harder to understand
and so we should minimize it I used it
in the in the assignment for week 2
because there was no other way to easily
get around it but you should minimize
the use ok thanks the next question
comes from sacheen and how she wants to
know a little bit more about this big o
notation that we introduced and so a
little bit of in unit 2 yeah so that's
the you know the answer that question is
a whole course in algorithms and and we
can't do that right here but basically I
the idea is Big O says approximately how
many instructions is it going to take to
execute this and actually Big O is an
upper bound on that and there's another
notation less widely used with big theta
which gives a more exact down but the
idea is
if I have a doubly nested loop that says
for i equals 1 to N and then inside of
that is nested for j equals one to n
then that's order N squared because
we're going to do end times and
executions of the inner loop and yeah
the basic idea is that's more than if we
were just doing water n executions of
the loop and so if you can get away with
a single loop instead of a double loop
that's better that's that's all really
all you need to know about big oak all
right and I should say there will be in
algorithms class sometime in the near
future for those who you want to learn
more about this I Thomas grace had a
question about these attributes use
function attributes specifically in the
c function that heads that starts in
seed items oaks going on there yeah so
dave evans and cs101 chose not to really
focus on python classes which is
probably a good choice because it's a
big topic and the idea here is that
classes of objects can have attributes
and these are parts or components of the
object and their name with its dot
notation so object dot and then the name
of a field that's part of the component
of that object and in most languages you
define all the fields ahead of time when
you defined what a class looks like you
says these are the fields that composes
this object Python is a more dynamic
language and some classes of objects
you're allowed to add fields to them as
you go and functions are one of those
types of dynamic objects where you can
at any point you say I want to add a new
attribute to this function other objects
have that same approach where you can
add to them and so what was going on in
that c function is that i needed two
variables that i wanted to keep track of
something i needed two counters and i
could have just used a global variable
name but that would be cluttering up the
namespace and there'd be no way for you
to you know if I just made up a name
like see starts and see items by looking
at the name of the variable you could
figure out that they were related but
there'd be no structural way to say that
these are all related table
long together and you want to minimize
the number of global variables because
of people's memory is small and so by
putting everything into one object we
say this belongs together and so using C
dot start rather than a variable name
see start is a way of structuring things
together and in Python you can do that
automatically you don't have to have a
declaration you can just say I want to
add a new attribute to a function you go
ahead and assign it great I had no idea
you could do that either I was very
excited yeah so they come from a
language like Java or C you're not used
at that there you gotta declare ahead of
time what your attributes are going to
be right um next question comes from
Tracy Zelman and she just wants to hear
a little bit about when do we use
lambdas how do you decide when to use a
normal function versus ok so all of
lambda is is a function definition
without assigning a name to it so a
normal function a function definition we
say def then we say the function name
the arguments in the body of the
function so we're simultaneously doing
two things for defining what the
function does and we're giving it a name
now what a lambda does is break those
those out saying we're defining a
function but we're not giving it a name
well why would you want to do that what
we do it all the time so if we have a
expression like say we have the the
arithmetic expression X plus 1 times X
minus 1 we didn't bother to give names
to those sub components the X plus 1 and
the X minus 1 we just wrote them down
and so a lambda is like that it's a
function that's a small thing we didn't
want to bother giving it a name we just
wanted to use it in place and so that's
the advantage of lambda that you aren't
you aren't bothered with a name and you
can just write it right there rather
than having to define it at one point
and then use it at a second point that's
the good thing about it the bad thing
about it is that it's limited in Python
lambda can only have an expression it
can't have statements in it and it just
doesn't really fit with the rest of the
language some languages are really
designed around expressions like that
and they go really well in Python it
doesn't fit that much
so I think mostly you should avoid it
and you just define a function with his
name in the normal way but sometimes
it's really convenient to put everything
in one place rather than having to
define in one place and use in a second
place great you day sir had some
questions about the program design
strategy that we've been using namely
should we implement this strategy that
we've been using in every single problem
we approach or are there some where we
don't really need it and if we choose
not to use the strategy what are some of
the disadvantages well I mean whatever
you can do to get your job done go ahead
and do it I've given you some approaches
you know I wouldn't say that there's
just one strategy but rather there's a
collection of strategies that you want
to be able to understand what's going on
make your inventory of concepts build
those up now you have a lot of choices
within that do I want to start top-down
bottom-up middle out that's all up to
you as long as you arrive at the end of
a description of the whole domain in the
whole program and you get it right then
congratulations to you so I think
everybody develops their own style for
how they go about addressing this but
there are ideas of what it means to have
a high quality program correctness
efficiency and so on and then more
driven by taste is what is it what does
it mean to be readable and extensible
and you'll learn that over time great
and for one last question takan z wants
to know if you have any good
recommendations for computer science and
specifically Python books books okay yes
I do have some recommendations and if
you search for Peter Norvig library in
google books I have some there and and
with this question maybe I'll go and
update them some more I can mention a
few in terms of general programming
books I really like the practice of
programming I like the elements of
programming style which is rather an old
and somewhat dated book now in terms of
the examples that uses but still really
up to date in terms of the advice I like
structure and interpretation of computer
programs which has been a standard
textbook for introductory computer
science
I like programming pearls is a nice
collection of short essays and then in
Python books now there's a lot of them
and I haven't kept up with all the
possibilities there's a nice online book
of how to think like a computer
scientist that as a Python version there
is a Python in a nutshell Python
cookbook learning python headfirst
python is i think is an interesting
somewhat different approach so there's
lots of them there and i'll try to
update my google books library to get a
little bit of commentary on each one all
right thank you um thank you for all the
questions thank you for your answers
okay stay tuned for the next unit which
we posted on Sunday and also for a
couple more additions to the Python
glossary all right three enclose</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
