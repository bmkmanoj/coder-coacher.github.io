words of caution the first one is that
the border between NP completeness and
polynomial time can sometimes be very
thin I already mentioned to you that for
example 3sat so where you just have
three variables in each clause is
np-complete but too sad where you just
have two variables is solvable in
polynomial time and there are many other
cases like that but of course this is
good news because if your problem turns
out to be just as hard to solve as too
sad you actually have a polynomial time
algorithm for it although it might
initially have seemed a bit harder or
sometimes even if your original problem
possibly is as hard as three set maybe
you can look at a slightly different
problem that becomes polynomial-time
solvable because oftentimes there's many
different ways to frame the practical
problem that you're trying to solve so
sometimes you're lucky there the second
thing is an actual word of caution
because this border here can sometimes
be so fragile it's very important to be
precise in your NP completeness proofs
because sometimes making just a little
mistake in an NP completeness proof can
invalidate this whole proof and of
course we don't want that now it's time
once more to congratulate you you now
know what NP completeness means and how
you can show NP completeness and
actually not many people can do that
very few people know precisely what NP
completeness means and also they are not
capable of showing NP completeness in
the next unit we're going to take you
even one step further we're going to
show you countermeasures against NP
completeness because even most people
that understand what NP completeness
means and that can also show NP
completeness actually tend to give up
once they have shown their problem to be
np-complete but that's actually not
necessary because there are many many
techniques which you can use to attack
even NP complete problems so what should
you do when you want to solve a problem
and show that is np-complete should you
carefully check your proof should you
have somebody else careful you take your
proof should you give up should you
maybe try to think about ways of
modifying your problem so
oh that it could not be np-complete or
should you try to use the techniques
that you are about to learn in the next
units of this course</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
