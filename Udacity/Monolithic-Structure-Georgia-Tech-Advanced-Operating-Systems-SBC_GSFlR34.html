approaches to operating system
structuring the first structure that I'd
introduce to you is what we will call as
the monolithic structure you have the
hardware at the bottom which is managed
by the operating system and hardware
includes of course the CPU memory
peripheral devices such as a network and
storage and so on and there are
applications at the top and each of
these applications is in its own
Hardware address space what that means
is that every application is protected
from one another because the hardware
ensures that the address Bay is occupied
the one application is different from
the other applications and that is the
first level of protection that you get
between the applications themselves and
all the services that applications may
expect from the operating system are
contained in this blob and that might
include file system a network access
scheduling these applications on the
available cpu virtual memory management
and access to other peripheral devices
the OSS will of course is a program
providing entry points for the
applications for the services that are
expected by the applications and the
code and the data structure of the
operating system is contained in its own
Hardware address space what that means
is that the operating system is
protected from the applications and vice
versa so even if an application were to
do anything in terms of misbehavior
either maliciously or unintentionally
because they are in their own address
spaces and the operating system is in
its own Hardware address space
malfunctioning of an application does
not affect the integrity of the
operating system services that is when
an application needs any system service
we switch from the hardware address
space that is representing this
particular application into the hardware
address space of the operating system
and execute the system code that
provides the service
that is expected by the application for
example accessing the file from the hard
disk or dynamic allocation of more
memory that an application may want or
sending a message on the network all of
these things are done within the
confines of the address space of the
operating system itself note that all of
the services expected of the operating
system file system memory management CPU
scheduling network and so on are all
contained in this one big blob and that
is the reason it's also sometimes
referred to as the monolithic structure
of an operating system</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
