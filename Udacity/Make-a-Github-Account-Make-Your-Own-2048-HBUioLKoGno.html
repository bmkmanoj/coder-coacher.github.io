I'm gonna call it 2048 - class okay and
then I'll do the free plan I'm sure
that's fine right yeah that doesn't seem
to do anything I don't want to enter my
credit card number maybe I can okay see
what my account yeah let's just see if
we can go to the account it looks like
it's set up I don't know well they
worked it I guess I don't need to put in
a credit card all right so we have a
account what's what do we do next well
so first we need to install git and so
there are two ways to access it what
does get it's the version control system
itself okay so github is just a place to
store get repos okay repositories so we
actually need the the software on our
computer to actually make the git
commits and run all those git commands
okay so should I just get hub caps off
for like that so there there is a github
specific UI that handles get for you and
it installs get when you install it so
um we can go ahead and use the get GUI
so I'm going to just search for that
what do I search for github GUI Jenny
yeah that'll probably get us there yeah
that's there mmm okay I'll do get up for
me yeah we got the one for Mac okay easy
enough
okay all right so we've downloaded it
unzipped it now let's install
alright alright so we've installed that
we opened it and I made this folder that
says my repositories yep so now we
actually need to get a repository we're
going to put in there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
