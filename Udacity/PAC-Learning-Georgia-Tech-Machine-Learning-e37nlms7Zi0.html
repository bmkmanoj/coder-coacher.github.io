definitions we'll be able to finally
nail down what pack learning is so let's
consider a concept class see that is to
say the the set from which the concept
that we're trying to learn comes from L
is our learner H is the hypothesis space
so it's the set of mappings that the
learner is going to consider an is going
to be the size of that space so kind of
the space of the hypotheses that are
being considered d is that distribution
of inputs like we looked at before
then we've got Greek letters epsilon and
Delta where epsilon is our error goal
which is to say we would like the error
in the hypothesis that we produce to be
no bigger than Epsilon it could be
smaller that would be great it would be
zero that would be awesome but it can't
be bigger than Epsilon
but we could get really unlucky and
actually not meet our error goal and so
Delta is what allows us to set a kind of
uncertainty goal or certainty goal which
is to say that with probability one
minus Delta the algorithm has to work
and by work you mean has to be able to
produce a true error less than or equal
to Epsilon exactly so why can't we
always force epsilon to be zero and you
know Delta to be zero right so to be
absolutely sure that we get zero error
so that part of it is because we are
sampling training examples from this
distribution D and so it's always
possible that we for example unless well
as long as there's a probability mass on
more than one example there's always a
probability that we draw a finite sample
that only ever gives us one example over
and over and over again mmm that's fair
so we just have to be really careful
about that also so if we're that unlucky
it's very unlikely to happen but when
that happens our error is going to be
very high but that's okay because it
won't happen very often okay sure sure
so basically you can't force it to be
zero under all circumstances either
epsilon R Delta you can't force them to
be zero in there all circumstances so
you have to allow some wiggle room there
yeah exactly it gives us exactly the
wiggle we need and that's actually where
this name pack comes from
it stands for probably approximately
correct
so we'd like to be correct but then
we're just going to keep adding weasel
words until we can actually achieve it
like what we would like to be correct
but we can't be exactly correct so it
should be approximately correct but we
can't be approximately
all the time so let's only probably be
approximately correct so using your your
words here you could have called that
one minus Delta Epsilon correct yes
right that's exactly right that's what
the Greek letters are playing and
correct is this you know error sub D of
H equals 0 yeah so 1 minus Delta Epsilon
err so D of H equals 0 doesn't roll off
the tongue quite as well as probably
approximately correct I would agree with
that
ok fair enough</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
