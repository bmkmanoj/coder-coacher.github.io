all those test patterns is that
functions like seek and alt are binary
which means if I want a sequence of four
patterns I have to do a sequence of a
followed by the sequence of B followed
by the sequence of C D and then I have
to count the number of params and get
them right it seems like we've much
easier if I could just write sequence of
a b c d and we talked before about this
idea of refactoring that is changing
your code to come up with a better
interface that makes the program easier
to use and this looks like a good
example this would be a really
convenient thing to do why did I write
seek this way well it was really
convenient to be able to define sequence
of X Y and only have to worry about
exactly two cases if I had done it like
this and I had to define sequence of an
arbitrary number of arguments and the
definition of sequence would have been
more complex so it's understandable that
I did this I want to make a change so
let's draw a picture so you know imagine
this is my whole program and then
somewhere here is a sequence part of my
program and now of course this has
connections to other parts of the
program sequence is called by and calls
other components and if we make a change
to sequence then we have to consider the
effects of those changes everywhere else
in which it's used and when we consider
these changes there's two factors we
would like to break out one is is the
change backward-compatible that is if I
make some change to sequence am i
guaranteed that however it was used
before that those uses are still good
and they don't have to be changed if so
then my change will be local the
sequence and I won't have to be able to
go all over the program changing it
everywhere else so that's a good
property to have so for example in this
case if I change sequence so that it
still accepted two arguments like it did
before but it also accept more than two
then that would be a backwards
compatible change as long as I didn't
break anything else and then the second
factor is whether the change is internal
or external so am i changing something
on the inside of sequins that doesn't
affect all the callers then that's okay
in a general that's going to be
backwards compatible or am i changing
something on the outside changing the
interface to the rest of the world and
in this case going from the binary
version to this NME version like I can
make it backwards compatible if I'm if
I'm careful it's definitely gonna be
both an internal and an external change
so I'm gonna have to do something to the
internal part of sequences and then I'm
also changing the signature of the
function so I'm affecting the outside as
well I can make that effect in a
backwards compatible way thinking about
those two factors what would be the
better way to implement this call and
let's say we're dealing with the match
set version where we're returning a
tuple would it be better to return the
tuple sequence a b c d or the tuple
sequence of a sequence of b sequence of
c d tell me which of these do you prefer
from these criteria</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
