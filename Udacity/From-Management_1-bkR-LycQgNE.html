you're a manager and you don't feel like
you have the capacity or maybe you don't
have the language the the sort of shared
language it sometimes happens that
people there's a fork in your career and
over time you become less technical as a
manager that doesn't block your empathy
so you can see and hear what your team
is struggling with so I think often it's
um it's enough to create a space in
which experimentation is is okay it's
safe I don't want to dig too deeply into
the psychology of managing in the tech
space but I will say this the both the
goal and the role of a management
position inside of in tech today is one
of supporting teams and team learning so
you can just take the approach of my
role here is to create a space in which
this team can learn its way out of the
pain that it sees and that is often
enough could you add money could you add
resources sure and you should at every
responsible moment but prior to that you
just need to encourage a strong culture
of learning as a manager I think your
primary role especially early is to
create a culture of learning to to make
it sort of safe and open for people to
experiment and learn</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
