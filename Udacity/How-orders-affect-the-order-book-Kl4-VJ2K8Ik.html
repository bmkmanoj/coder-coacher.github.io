order book works and how exchanges work
let's look at a couple more examples or
ders for brevity I'm leaving out the
symbol IBM this is all about IBM so just
keep that in mind okay so a market order
comes in to buy a hundred shares at
market so again we see that there's a
thousand shares that people are willing
to sell and the exchange has to give the
best price to the client and so we would
give the client 100 shares at this price
so what happens the order comes in 100
shares go away and now the order book is
changed just so that there's nine
hundred shares available here now
instead of a thousand and the execution
price is $100 let's consider now a limit
order someone wants to buy again 100
shares at a limit of a hundred and two
and two cents so looking at the order
book again we can satisfy that order and
again at a hundred dollars so we're
saying that we want to pay no more than
a hundred dollars in two cents so again
we can execute it a hundred and now this
goes down to eight hundred shares
instead of nine hundred being available
and the execution price for this
transaction again is a hundred dollars
and note also that that's less than that
limit price of a hundred dollars and two
cents let's look now at one last order a
market order where someone wants to sell
a hundred and seventy-five shares so
that comes in and we have a hundred
shares available at ninety nine ninety
five so those get sold and there's none
left there at that price so 100 shares
get executed at 99.95 so to get this
seventy-five more shares we need to go
deeper into the book so we'll take these
fifty zero left there we still need 25
more shares to meet this order for 175
so we go over and deeper into the book
and take some of these so after all
these transactions the order book has
been changed quite substantially
and this client gets a hundred shares at
ninety nine ninety five fifty at ninety
nine ninety and twenty-five at ninety
nine oh five so altogether there's some
average price at which this was executed
for that client note now that as time
has gone on the executed prices have
been decreasing clearly we're seeing
that you know that's a consequence of
there's much more sell pressure than buy
pressure so that's how the order book
works and how exchanges use order books
to facilitate transactions between their
clients this is what an order book looks
like in real life here in the middle we
have prices and on either side here we
see the order sizes we're seeing here
sell orders and how large they are and
on this other side buy orders and how
large they are and the prices that
they're being executed here are in the
middle and as you can see it's changing
dynamically and rapidly as trades are
executed here we see a price chart
showing how the prices going up and down
as these trades are being executed so
that's a why of order book this is using
the trading platform called
think or swim</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
