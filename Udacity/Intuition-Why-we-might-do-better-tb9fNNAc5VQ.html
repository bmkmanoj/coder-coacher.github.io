fact there's a big clue in the way we've
described the algorithm so far remember
that the BFS visits the graph in waves
now this wavy nature of a BFS has two
really important implications first an
upper bound on the span shouldn't be the
number of vertices instead it ought to
be the number of waves let's give each
wave which consists of all the vertices
at the same distance from the source a
special name column levels so here's a
question for you what is an upper limit
on the number of levels one answer comes
from a particular property of a graph
called its diameter the diameter is
basically the maximum shortest distance
between any pair of vertices now here's
an important point about diameter it's a
property of a whole graph so that makes
it only an upper bound on the number of
levels from any starting vertex for
example I claim that this graph has a
diameter of five and that's despite the
fact that the shortest distance from s
Danny vertex is for can you see why the
diameter is 5 mm I smell a quiz now the
process of visiting the graph level by
level is sometimes called a level
synchronous traversal that leads us to
the second big idea if you perform a
level synchronous BFS then it shouldn't
matter in what order you visit the
vertices of any given level so if i take
level 2 for example the fact that i
visit this node before this node or this
node before this node really shouldn't
matter after all they get the same
distance let's be a little bit more
precise imagine running a BFS and
stopping it at some level call it L now
let's look at any two unvisited
neighbors of the set now these both have
to be a distance of just one away from
the set so it doesn't matter which one
we see first in fact we can even look at
them at the same time because they'll
both have the same value</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
