and transforming it in polynomial time
into a new input for another problem so
that you get the same solution is known
as a polynomial time reduction and if
you want to be precise about what you're
applying this reduction to your you can
say that you have a polynomial time
reduction from X to Y so in other words
you can take a problem X and show that
the problem Y is powerful enough to
solve problem X so in order to help you
wrap your head a little bit more around
polynomial time reductions we'll do a
little quiz here so I would like you to
think about if we managed to reduce a
problem X to another problem Y what does
that imply and I'm going to give you
four choices here and I know it's easy
to guess which one of those are correct
but you should really give this some
thought first to make sure that you
understand the concept of reductions
because this is going to play a very
important role in this unit and also in
the next units so I'll give you four
choices here does reducing a problem X
to a problem Y imply that X is at least
as hard to solve as Y and by hardness I
mean the distinction between polynomial
time and exponential time so in this
case here for example if Y is only
solvable in exponential time does that
mean that X can only be solved in
exponential time as well or is it the
other way around does it imply that Y is
at least as hard to solve as X does it
mean that if X can be solved in
polynomial time then so can y or does it
mean that if Y can be solved in
polynomial time then so can X so please
check all of the answers here that are
correct</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
