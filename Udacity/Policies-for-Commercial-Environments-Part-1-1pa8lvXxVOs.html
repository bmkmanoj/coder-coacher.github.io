environments first of all you know when
you go work for a company they might do
a background check on you but they don't
clear you at the secret or top secret
level so clearance is really not common
when it comes to these kind of
environments however there are other
requirements that may arise in these
kind of places if we talked about we go
back to our payroll if you are a payroll
department employee then you can access
applications that have to do with
payroll but others should not be able to
do that so one requirement could be that
data is accessed by certain applications
and only certain users be able to gain
access to certain kind of applications
requirement may be that nonpayroll
department people don't have access to
the payroll application other
requirements that arise in these
commercial environments is conflict of
interests is pretty common so if you're
a law firm have two customers and
there's some competitive relationship
between those then alloy working on one
case should not have access to data that
belongs to the other company when those
two companies compete separation of duty
typically is good for reducing the
likelihood of rod so if one person can
do multiple things it's easier for them
to commit fraud in commercial
environments clearance is not there blp
is not very useful but perhaps you know
the need for mandatory access control is
there so so we want to look at some
models that may make sense in this
setting</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
