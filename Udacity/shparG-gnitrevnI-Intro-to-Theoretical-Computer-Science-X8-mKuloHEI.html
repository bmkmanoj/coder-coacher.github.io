done with some adjacency matrices just
so you can get a bit more comfortable so
let's talk about inverse graphs in the
unit we discussed how to create the
inverse graph of a graph that helped us
solve the clique problem so for example
the inverse graph of the graph that i
drew for would be the graph with the red
edges here so quite a different graph
here now how do we represent this as an
adjacency matrix well the diagonal is
the same because we're not allowing
loops anywhere in here so the diagonal
is still zeros and the only ones we have
in the adjacency matrix are from D to a
or from a lady since the matrix is
symmetric and from B to D and everything
else is 0 because all of these edges
disappear in the inverse graph now how
would we represent this in Python well
an easy way to represent a matrix in
Python is as a list of lists so to look
at some output of some code we define a
completely empty graph here and then we
print the graph we see that this is just
a list of lists with five zeros in each
inner list and if we invert this graph
then we see that we get the graph of all
ones except for the diagonal here of
course since we don't allow loops so
what I want you to do is write an
inverse graph function such that it
takes a graph or a list of lists and
outputs puts a list of lists which is
the inverse of the input graph</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
