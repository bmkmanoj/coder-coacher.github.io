webdev specific built tools only became
popular a few years ago the most simple
build tool is just a shell or bash
script this scripts with esh extension
are just a series of terminal commands
of functions and can be executed from
the command line but working with
dependency graphs or only updating files
I have changed a tricky task with just a
shell and this is where the original
build system mate comes in adding fire
management sugar and more after make
came built tools such as and maven and
Gradle all especially popular in the
world of Java
all of them have declarative tasks but
you need to use XML to drive them or in
the case of Gradle a programming
language that you might not understand
but web developers have the burning hate
for everything XML with the only
exception of HTML as an accepted flavor
and so came a new set of modern web
development focused build tools tools
that would use a language that web
developers are already familiar with
JavaScript out of the JavaScript on
node.js based build tools to have become
very popular grunt and gulp but why are
these the popular ones and what should
you look for in a build tool I thought
you never asked a build tool should be
fast in execution as this need for speed
when iterating on a website or app we're
used to changing a line and reloading
the page afterwards to see the changes
instantly and disrupting that flow is a
no-go should also be supported by a
healthy community that exchanges plugins
that add functionality and answers
questions on sites such as Stack
Overflow with popular build tools such
as grunt chances are there's already an
answer to your problem as somebody else
has had it before
next it's very important that even if it
comes with a lot of bells and whistles
you can extend it with more and custom
functionality as you see fit and finally
the tool should at best already solve a
few common problems out of the box for
it to be useful grunt the currently most
popular tool fulfills many of these
requirements it has a strong community
and a healthy plug-in ecosystem but gulp
the new popular kid on the block has two
significant advantages of a grunt it's
built for speed and can execute tasks in
parallel plus converts open files into
superfast streams internally go p--'s
tasks use code of a configure
which means that you can just use normal
JavaScript and extend or modify tasks
that don't work for you you might have
already guessed it we're sticking with
gulp for the rest of this course but if
your team or company - this grunt or a
different system instead fear not
usually the concepts of what work is
done and I love them is quite similar
and many times the plugin exists for
both</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
