gravity this equation for the force of
gravity is only true for point masses we
would have to concentrate all of our
earth in one single spot
so do we cheat when we don't do so the
nice thing about gravity is that this
equation still holds for a rotationally
symmetric distributed mass this is
called Newton's share theorem and you
are going to see in the upcoming quiz
why this is called shell theorem to see
if i newtons shell theorem holds to see
why newton's shell theorem holds it's
best to introduce an analogy to water
this looks outrageous but please bear
with me if we leave our first mass where
it is and move the second mass around we
can determine a force vector at every
point in space we get a force field
imagine that this wasn't the solar
system but a pool of water and the water
has velocities and the velocity of the
water is described by our force field
water flows downward here at a high
speed it flows to the right at a low
speed at this point it flows to the left
at a somewhat higher speed at this point
and so on we interpret the force field
as a velocity field in our pool of water
of course we're ignoring the units of
measurement right now of course when
setting force equal to velocity we're
ignoring units of measurement for a
moment to make that work there has to be
a huge drain in the center so the first
mass acts like a cosmic drain why can we
do so why does water
behave in the same way as this force
field does to understand that consider
two imaginary spheres in our pool both
centered at the drain and the radius of
the outer sphere should be twice the
radius of the inner sphere which means
that the surface area of the outer
sphere is four times the surface area of
the inner sphere all lengths are being
multiplied by two these are square
meters they are multiplied by two
squared now the important quantity to
consider
is the flow of water through these
spheres are many cubic meters per second
flow through these surfaces this number
has to be the same for the outer and for
the Inner Sphere we are not losing water
or gaining water in between but as the
outer sphere as a surface area of four
times that of the Inner Sphere the
velocity has to go up to transport the
same amount of water per second through
each of these spheres the velocity at
the Inner Sphere has to quadruple as
compared to this velocity at the outer
sphere this is precisely what we saw
before with gravity as we double the
distance the force shrinks to one
quarter of the original of course this
doesn't only work for a factor of two
this works for all ratios and hence we
can indeed identify the force field of
gravity with a velocity field of water
once this analogy between gravity and
water is in place it's easy to see that
the flow through each of these surfaces
has to be the same let's assume that we
have three masses at the center of this
sphere and the same masses at the center
of that smaller sphere and the same
three masses somewhere inside this weird
closed surface then the flow through
each of these surfaces has to be the
same if we replace the force field of
gravity by the velocity field of water
we have to see the same number of cubic
meters per second for each of these
surfaces because we are draining water
in three spots at the same rate somehow
that amount of water has to enter from
the outside and it has to be the same
amount of water because we are draining
the same amount of water in each of them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
