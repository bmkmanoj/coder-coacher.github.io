initializing an NS array of strings
notice that if I look for the method add
object or something akin to Swift's
append method it's not found in fact if
you search the NS or a class reference
you won't find any methods for adding
objects to the array I can make a new
array using the array by adding object
method but I can't add an object to an
existing NS array the other option is to
define my array as an NS mutable array
and now we can see that the method add
object is indeed available to an NS
mutable array and we can add booties to
our kayaking gear we'll go ahead and run
it we can look down here in the console
and see the contents of our array swift
and Objective C differ in their use of
reference types and value types Swift
encourages widespread use of value types
lakes trucks while objective-c favors
reference types like classes structure
is pretty sparingly in Objective C and
they don't have the capability that
structs do in Swift
for example this beer struct on the left
that we've seen before in Swift would be
encoded as a class and objective-c to
understand what this means for
mutability let's compare what happens
when a type is copied by value and what
happens when an object is copied by
reference this comparison will likely be
familiar to you by now focus on the last
four lines of code and take a few
seconds to guess the value of my beard
style
down here in the console we can see that
my beer is still a lager Struck's are
value types when my beer was assigned to
your beer a new copy was made and the
values of the two copies are independent
let's see what happens when beer is
implemented as a class in Objective C
now focus on these four lines of code
and again try to guess the value of my
beard style we'll run the project and
down here in the console we see that the
style of my beer is now a stout classes
are reference types which means that
when we assigned my beer to your beer a
new reference was made but my beer and
your beer
both point to the same underlying
instance when we changed the value of
your beer style we changed the value of
the underlying instance to which both
beers refer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
