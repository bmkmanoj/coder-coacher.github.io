solutions we have advantages and
disadvantages as well as far as the ADT
abstract data type solution it's very
good as far as maintainability and reuse
those particular components could be
used in other applications by just just
plucking them out remember they've
hidden away details on the other hand
because things are hidden away you have
to invoke them through function call
interfaces which might be more expensive
so you might pay a price in performance
with respect to implicit invocation okay
it has also maintainability advantages
if you change the representation because
the this the clients and servers don't
know much about each other you only have
to change them in one place you don't
have to change change the others which
also facilitates your use on the other
hand because it's implicit invocation
and you don't know who you're talking to
a lot of times it's sometimes difficult
to think about or control what's going
on and if you had to do some kind of
debugging it might be tricky to know you
know which of the components was
responsible for some kind of problem
also as with the ADT solution because
you have these more or less abstract
interfaces between things there may be a
performance hit with respect to pipe and
filter pipe and filter is very intuitive
easy to think about it's also easy to
reuse because each of the filters along
the way you can plunk out and put into
another another solution on the other
hand if we wanted to make changes such
as making the system interactive pipe
and filter wouldn't work at all it's
going to stream things stream things
through also it's not particularly space
efficient because you have no no place
where you've stored the data which means
you might have multiple copies of that
data floating around as you're
processing so each of the particular
solutions has advantages and
disadvantages and in any particular
situation you want to look at what's
important to you his performance
important is memory footprint important
and pick a solution that has the
particular advantages that you need and
avoids the
or disadvantages that might bother you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
