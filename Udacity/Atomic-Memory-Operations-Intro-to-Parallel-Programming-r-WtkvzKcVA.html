threads incrementing ten array elements
we got the wrong answer one solution
might be to sprinkle barriers throughout
the code that I just showed you but
another solution is something called
atomic memory operations atomic memory
operations or Atomics for short are
special instructions that the GPU
implements specifically for this problem
and there's a bunch of Atomics you can
get the list in the programming guide
but some of the examples that you might
use our atomic add atomic min atomic xor
and so forth a particularly interesting
one is called atomic cas which stands
for compare-and-swap let's look at how
these work okay so here's our code again
and in this time instead of calling
increment naive let's call a new
function increment atomic this kernel is
almost exactly the same every thread
computes what thread it is and then it
mods that by the size of the array to
figure out where it's going to write but
the difference is that whereas before we
were just doing a standard C operation G
sub I equals G sub I plus 1 which has
one read modify and a right here we're
going to use the atomic add operation so
this is a CUDA this atomic add function
is a CUDA built-in that's going to take
a pointer which should be to somewhere
in device memory share to global memory
and an amount to add a value to add okay
so this has the same effect every thread
is going to go and add 1 to the value at
G sub I but the difference is that this
is using special hardware that the GPU
has built-in to perform atomic
operations so now we're guaranteed that
only one thread at a time can do this
read modify write operation ok so now
we'll scroll down change our code call
increment atomic if the only change will
make compile the code again and run it
so this looks more like it now we're
writing a million total threads and a
thousand blocks writing into ten array
elements and this time as we expect
every rail every array element contains
the number 100,000 when all is done ok
so the atomic operation prevented these
collisions where multiple threads were
trying to read and write
from the same memory location at the
same time and instead serialized them
making sure that only one thread at a
time has access during the course of
that read-modify-write ad operation and
we get the right result notice it took
longer before it took about three
milliseconds now we're taking about 3.7
milliseconds so atomic operations come
with the cost and that's something I'm
going to go into try this a few more
times to make sure that we get the same
result that time it took about four
milliseconds closer to four again down
around three and so forth</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
