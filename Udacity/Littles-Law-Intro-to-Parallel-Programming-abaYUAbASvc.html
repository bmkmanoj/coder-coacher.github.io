why we're focusing on memory the way we
are our overarching goal of course is
just to make code fast so we say great
GPUs are fast let's use those but why
are they fast GPUs are fast first
because they are massively parallel with
hundreds or thousands of processors on a
single chip working for you to solve
your problem but also because they have
an extremely high bandwidth memory
system to feed those massively parallel
processors ok so if the memory system
can't deliver data to all of these
processors and store results from all
those processors then we're not going to
get the full speed out of our GPU and
that's why on a memory limited kernel
like transpose our sub goal is really to
utilize all the available memory
bandwidth hints our focus on global
memory coalescing DRAM utilization and
so on now I really want to ask a
question a little bit more rigorously
what do we mean by utilizing all the
available memory bandwidth and this is
going to bring us to a very important
very simple principle called littles law
let's have the talented kim Dilla
illustrate this for us now John little
is an MIT professor who studies
marketing he formulated his eponymous
law when writing about queueing theory
and business processes and littles law
is usually used to reason about things
like optimizing the number of customers
in a line at Starbucks or maybe the size
of queues in a factory but littles law
is really very general and can be
applied to many things including memory
systems and computers in that context
littles law states that the number of
bytes delivered equals the average
latency of each memory transaction times
the bandwidth let's be a little more
precise and emphasize that we care about
the useful bytes delivered and the
problem with uncoolest global memory
accesses is that not all of the bytes
and every memory transaction are
actually being used
that's why coalescing global memory
accesses helps ensure that every byte
delivered and a memory transaction will
be used so given this definition what
can we do to improve our bandwidth let's
check all that apply we can increase the
number of bytes delivered we can
increase the latency meaning the time
between memory transactions we can
decrease the number of bytes delivered
or we can decrease the latency
or time between transactions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
