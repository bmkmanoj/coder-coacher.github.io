copies and Colonel launched operations
in the below code snippets take exactly
one second to complete what is the
minimum time taken before the results
are available on the host so here's the
code snippets
we'll start by declaring a couple of
CUDA streams s1 and s2 and by using the
CUDA stream create call to create
streams with those stream objects and
then there's a bunch of code snippets
and I want you to tell me how long each
one is going to take in seconds I've
taken a couple of shortcuts here I
haven't showed you da-rae hrad array 1h
or a 1/2 I haven't showed you these
things getting allocated you can assume
that D array has been allocated with
CUDA malloc and it is a pointer to some
device memory and that H array has been
allocated in pinned host memory using
cuda host malloc and for shorthand i
just abbreviated cuda host to device as
h2 b and cuda device to host as DITA age
notice that I'm launching a single block
with a fairly small number of threads in
each of these thread launches so if all
of these operations take one second
what's the minimum time that each of
them can take to complete what's the
minimum time that it'll be before the
final results are ready for the host</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
