hey Georgia i'm working on a web app to
share photos and my pebbles from around
the world i call it project compass
that's awesome how's it coming well
actually a little stuck I work with a
designer and we made some mock-ups but I
don't know how to take these designs and
turn them into cover well that's what
front-end programmers do front-end
programmers take designs from designers
and use HTML CSS and JavaScript to
create full-fledged websites let's take
a look we interact with websites on a
daily basis and we rely on these
websites for just about everything we do
but how often do we stop and think about
how these websites are created every
image link and interaction on a website
has been intentionally created by a
front-end programmer front-end
developers solve a lot of problems that
users are faced with every day they need
to find ways to optimize website loading
speeds the Google home page loads
quickly because front-end developers
have organized the code in a way that
prioritizes loading speed they also
think about how websites will fit on
different screen sizes which is called
responsive design Uber's home page is
designed so that the content adapts to
the screen size as it changes I can see
all the elements and you can notice the
person the image is intentionally
centered on the page they also take
design mockups created by designers and
use them to make websites using HTML CSS
and JavaScript front-end developers at
Udacity took this mock-up created by
designers and use HTML CSS and
JavaScript to make functioning and
interactive websites front-end
developers also work on many different
types of projects they use the jQuery
library to add interactivity in
animation to web pages the Spotify here
in music website uses javascript and
jquery to create interactions and
animations as user scroll on their
website many front-end developers also
create video games using javascript
front-end developers can also use
javascript to create games like foxes
and shotguns which was made by florian a
former Udacity student finally
they make requests to AP is such as Yelp
and design how data will be displayed
trulia has added a restaurants feature
using the Yelp API and front-end
developers designed how the structure on
data would look to home buyers friend
developers work on many different types
of projects and solve lots of problems
let's hear from Kevin a front-end
developer at Udacity</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
