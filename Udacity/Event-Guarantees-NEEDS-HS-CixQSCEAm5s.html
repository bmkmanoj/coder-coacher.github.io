been chatting a lot with the developer
about the order of certain events which
got me thinking let's say you have a
user mm-hmm and the user does a couple
edits is there any way you can know how
firebase sends these edits to the server
or what order they're processed in or
what order they'll trigger event
listeners in I was just working through
some of these scenarios earlier today it
turns out the firebase does have what
they call it vent guarantees which are
guarantees about how firebase will
handle your data let's take a look
firebase provides several related
guarantees for database events all fire
base operations perform locally by your
app will immediately fire events events
or notifications such as a child node
was added or a childhood was changed
this is helpful when there is network
latency or a loss in Internet
connectivity in these situations when
connectivity is reestablished the app
will receive the appropriate set of
events and all the clients will catch up
with the current server state another
guarantee is that of eventual
consistency this means that events will
eventually reflect the correct state of
the data even when temporary events such
as separate clients writing similar
changes to the database and approximate
the same time prevents an immediate
update to the database after some time
passes the database will become
consistent with all the changes a third
guarantee is event order writes from a
single client will always be written to
the server and broadcast out to other
users in order if a single client
performs write operations to three
locations in its firebase database those
three operations will be delivered to
all currently connected clients in the
same order that the originating client
sent them in finally firebase guarantees
that whenever something is read from the
database with a value event type object
for example add value event listener or
add listener for single value event it
is triggered last this is in the case
where you have both child event
listeners and value event listeners on
the same location the child event
listeners will be triggered first so
when data is stored or when a chain
the order is data is written or updated
the data is then synchronized to a data
snapshot child events are triggered and
then the value events are triggered</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
