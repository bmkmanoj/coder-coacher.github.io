be playing asteroids games forever did
you this is PI noon it's a more
sophisticated example you can refer to
in order to see how a variety of more
advanced techniques are used it's a
simple multiplayer party game where you
can throw pies at your friends it's
written in C++ and supports up to four
players using a multi screen mode with
Android TV in this section I'll
introduce topics and technologies that
help you create a great gaming
experience as well as some that take
advantage of the unique capabilities of
Android we won't go into great depth
with each of these but you will get an
idea of what the different components
have to offer and when you're ready you
can explore further on your own by
following the links in the instructor
notes first up we have Google Play game
services you can think of Google Play
services is a tool box which is tightly
integrated with android it helps you
with common tasks and game development
these include storing and synchronizing
game data on the cloud as well as
sending invitations and auto matching
players also included our tools to help
you build real-time and turn-based
multiplayer gaming experiences it also
helps you build achievements and quests
into your game which are great ways to
hook players you can also collect
analytics data to help you understand
how players interact with your game all
you have to do is create an account on
the Play Developer console and this
works a lot like the cast developer
console we covered earlier all of these
features are free of charge aside from a
small one time fee to verify your
account after that you can access all
these games features via a Google API
client just like when you use any other
feature in google play services and
don't forget to add the scope gains when
you create your API client object that's
a common mistake that developers do all
the time next up are nearby connections
the nearby connections API lets you
discover other devices on the local
network and exchange messages with them
in real time this lets you do two great
things first you can allow one player to
set up a multiplayer game on the local
network and then have other players join
in or much cooler in my opinion one
player can set up a game on a shared
device like an Android TV then other
players can join in using their mobile
device as a display controller
combination individual players see a
customized display on their mobile
device as well as a shared display on
the main screen this is a very unique
and extremely catchy capability and it
makes your game super easy to use and
fun to interact with inside the
instructor notes you'll find a video
demonstrating exact
how this works and doc you can follow to
build this into your game in Android 5.0
lollipop or higher multiple networks are
supported this means that there can be
more than one connected network on an
Android TV device at one time for
instance both ethernet and Wi-Fi you can
check for this case using the
connectivity manager and if so you can
actually select the type of network
you'd like to use in your game although
there's usually not a tremendous
difference some developers prefer
ethernet for the slightly lower latency
next up we have web p web p is an open
source image format developed by google
it's more space efficient than jpg or
PNG without a noticeable loss in quality
you can use this to compress your
textures and reduce the size of your
final game package web p supports
transparency and lossless compression as
well as lossy compression if you need
even smaller file sizes as a default
this is supported by Android TV so you
don't need to add any external libraries
to encode and decode web p images there
are also open source libraries for other
platforms and speaking of pi noon in c++
you should be aware of the Android NDK
or native development toolkit this tool
set allows you to implement parts of
your app using native code a really
important note here the vast majority of
apps will not benefit from this approach
and you should do this only if you have
a very good and very specific reason the
best reason I can think of is if you
have a large pre-existing codebase you'd
like to reuse like in the case 2 pi noon
generally the performance trade-offs of
using c++ if any are not worth the
complexity cost now an Android TV ndk
almost always works without any problems
at all however I'd strongly recommend
you test your code on a real device not
an emulator</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
