example I'm going to focus my attention
here this could either be 1 minus 2
minus 3 or 1 minus 2 minus 3 this ends
up being 2 1 minus negative 1 this ends
up being negative 4 so very different
answers the parse tree for this
interpretation looks a bit like this
it's left heavy with this other
subtraction 1-2 down into the left over
here the parse tree would be right heavy
no i'm not drawing all the nodes in the
parse tree just to save a bit of time
mostly i'm highlighting its shape so
this is an example of a string that has
more than one parse tree in our grammar
similarly this bigger string has more
than one parse tree in our grammar it
might even have four different parse
trees possible even more you'd have to
try that and find out but notably it
contains 1 minus 2 minus 3 as a subpart
so even if this minus 4 at the end is
perfectly unambiguous it still has
exactly the same problems we saw here
still has at least to parse trees so
it's even worse than its friend two
lines above if you look carefully all of
the other examples don't demonstrate
ambiguity each one of these has exactly
one parse tree even this big complicated
thing at the bottom only has one parse
tree it's perfectly balanced 1-2 on the
left 3-4 on the right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
