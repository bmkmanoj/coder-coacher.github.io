basically anytime humans are involved
there's going to be dirty data this is a
lot like any time my kids are involved
there's going to be mud track through
the kitchen there are lots of ways in
which we touch data we work with let me
get some hand sanitizer and then we'll
get started so we're gonna have user
entry errors in some situations we won't
have any data coding standards or where
we do have standards
they'll be poorly applied causing
problems in the resulting data we might
have to integrate data where different
schemas have been used for the same type
of item we'll have legacy data systems
where data was encoded when disk and
memory constraints were much more
restrictive than they are now over time
systems evolve needs change and data
changes some of our data won't have the
unique identifiers it should other data
will be lost in transformation from one
format to another and then of course
there's always programmer error and
finally data might have been corrupted
in transmission or storage by cosmic
rays or other physical phenomena so hey
one that's not our fault</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
