the new algorithm on average check fewer
assignments than the original this is
actually true and to see this really all
you have to look at is that the original
has to check every possible assignment
if it doesn't then it can't know that
it's actually the lowest assignment
whereas the new algorithm as soon as it
finds a vertex cover that works since it
starts from the bottom it knows that
that is the minimum vertex cover so it
knows that it can be done so on average
the new algorithm will actually check
fewer assignments than the original now
does the original algorithm sometimes
look through fewer assignments this is
actually false and again the same
reasoning applies the original algorithm
has to look through every possible
assignment whereas the new algorithm
sometimes doesn't now is the worst-case
behavior of the new algorithm in O
notation better than the original this
is actually false and to see this you
just have to realize that sometimes the
new algorithm is still going to have to
check through every possible assignment
sometimes that's the best minimum vertex
cover you can hope to find and since
that's the worst case and it's the same
as the old algorithm the worst-case
behavior in O notation is also just as
bad as the original however the best
case behavior is actually better than
the original algorithm the new algorithm
does better in the best case the best
case is that there happens to be a
minimum vertex cover of only one vertex
and it checks that first and if it does
well then it's done whereas the best
case of the original algorithm is still
exponential because it has to check
every possible assignment so the best
case behavior is far better now what
about the average case how can we expect
the new algorithm to behave on average
well actually the new algorithm isn't on
average asymptotically better than the
original algorithm again because it may
have to check through just as many
assignments as the original algorithm
now this last question is tricky how
about the average case behavior of the
new
gurthang compared to the original is it
better asymptotically this is actually
false and this might be a little hard to
see but a good way of looking at it is
to realize that on average the new
algorithm is still going to have to
check through at least half of the
possible vertex covers of all of the
possible assignments and there are
exponentially many different assignments
to the graph well half of an exponential
number of assignments is still
exponential so on average the behavior
of the new algorithm is still
exponential which is just as bad as the
original so if you got that great if you
didn't don't worry that's kind of a
tricky question but hopefully it got you
thinking so if you had trouble with any
of these don't worry about it some of
them were a little bit tricky but
hopefully they got you thinking okay
that's it for this problem set hope see
you in the next unit</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
