you for taking the time to be with us
today I know the students are going to
learn a knock a lot by hearing from you
and I know you're very busy so I really
appreciate it not pleasure I wish we can
share a glass of wine at the same time
but anyway we'll proceed well if we can
figure out how to do that you can i'll
probably get very rich well you know
we've got a lot of wine up here in
Charlottesville so I always try to help
the locals yes you do so don I mean
you've been a thought leader in
informatics for four years you chaired
most of the important IOM reports that
I've alluded to throughout the course so
you have a unique perspective what do
you think we are today on transforming
our health care system particularly
through the use of health IT and what
are your hopes for the future well it's
really been exciting to have been
involved in this I guess the only thing
is frustrating this is that I'm not
getting younger because I think it still
has to play out but we are really I
think making terrific progress when you
consider that the 1991 report on the
computer based patient record was called
an essential technology for healthcare
and that it took until just you know
2009 for the high-tech legislation to
really make this a national kind of
development with meaningful use and so
forth so clearly these have been really
momentous times and it's exciting to me
to see that we are way past the early
majority were under the late majority of
people now doing this both in hospitals
and practices so having said that I
don't know if you saw I can send you the
reference but I had a paper with a
couple of colleagues this year's the
wave is finally broken where are we now
that spoke to some of the issues and
there are a lot of issues out there
there's not the interoperability that we
need there's not the functionality that
we need
the point of view of even physicians let
alone all the other health members of
the health team so it's it's a glass
half-full half-empty kind of thing but
actually I think it's it's a really in a
good spot some of where we are though is
of course we mostly have been using
health IT in terms of say computer
technology and I think increasingly now
we're using communications technology
and all these things are new from the
time the study was done and it moved
forward so we're always going to be in
the situation of trying to both keep up
with where the technology and
opportunities go but a lot of progress
has been made and I think what I'm
excited about talk about also is where
some of the pinch points are and where
we can go next well I will certainly
post that paper for the students to read
the you know as we look at a health care
system that is increasingly using
digital records instead of paper the
research community is very excited about
the prospect of having access to huge
amounts of digital data to study it to
help improve care or gain new knowledge
and maybe even improve the health care
system itself but I don't have to tell
you getting to that data is often a very
difficult time consuming process mostly
because of concerns about patient
privacy some people feel maybe the
pendulum has swung too far on that maybe
we're actually harming our ability to
use digital data as a result what's your
view well in fact I am one of those
people who believe that some of the
issues are not necessarily the HIPAA
legislation per se but clearly I think
hHS has not in fact creatively trying to
manage to this to balance these
competitive goods privacy is a good
thing but too much privacy and obviously
you can't have knowledge you can't run
government you can't run a search and so
forth and I think the problem with the
principal problem with hippo was that it
was built in an era that was all
pre-internet so the fact that you could
do data analytics and do translational
bioinformatics and though the human
genome and proteomics and you know
epigenetics with epidemiologic data as
well let alone using it to improve
healthcare systems with clinical alerts
and even community health approaches
using public health dimensions of this
all that was well before Hitler so
candidly I've been with spending hours
up on the hill with the Energy and
Commerce staff to try to see if we can
as part of their initiative to improve
really cures is where they're wanting to
go but care as well see how we can
hopefully make some reforms in these
things because right now it's it's not
only a problem for research it's also a
problem for education too we hear I hear
issues where pharmacy students that are
interested in trying to learn how to do
data mining and looking at drug use and
so forth I can get to the record data in
some schools for some various reasons as
I say the issue is not only the
legislation which was built for
different era mostly clinical trials
where the patient was at risk to secure
use of these data for data analytics
where honestly the risks are extremely
small so I and I think actually from if
you look at the hospitals around the
country that are doing research those
patients actually overwhelmingly want
doctors to do and
and other health professionals to do
this research and in fact actually are
sort of assume that we already were
doing it so we really clearly have some
issues here and there kind of cultural
issues were not all scientists who
eagerly wanted to share data but i think
that clinical translational science
awards have really cracked into that
plus what has happened in the last
hundred years is the human species has
not only been very productive but
they've been very productive too and as
a result of that the human genome has
gotten more complicated so if we're
going to really crack these things which
we can we really need very big data sets
and you can't aggregate those in fact
where you talk to a group of patients or
patient advocates with one problem
because a lot of these are
multi-dimensional kinds of problems in
fact most of them are they're not single
single gene or single issue a single
dimensional issues so anyway tremendous
opportunities but also candidly we're
leaving a huge amount of discovery on
the table example another quick example
yep says you can use personal health
data identify all the data for Duke
doing quality studies in a hospital but
if you find something that really you'd
like to share with your neighbors and
colleagues and publish it you got to go
all the way back to an IRB and start all
over well busy people may not want to
mess with that not in some big
institutions they spend a lot of money
and extra effort to help facilitate
people being able to deal with that but
you know we can't afford to lose that
wherever it is smaller institutions or
larger institutions so we got to work
smarter we can't work harder I think the
government's not going to throw more
money at health care that's mean that's
that's I think becoming increasingly
relevant for both research as well so we
we've got to get better data liquidity
as a term stalled and
move around for care for research and
then also ultimately then for a
population health well we you've
mentioned patients a number of times and
I think most people would agree that
patients are the ultimate decider when
it comes to the use of their data and a
number of people have suggested that
patients create their own data
repositories that might be housing a PHR
and some other tool specifically for the
purpose of mediating the sharing of
their data do you think this is an
inevitable development do you think it's
a good development if it happens might
that be the way to increase the
accessibility of clinical data for
research and other purposes well I put
we're the only approach I be strongly
against it mostly because that we know
at least twenty five percent of people
really don't care if their dinner use
for anything but they don't want to be
bothered to be asked about it so anytime
you're carving out twenty-five percent
of the population and keep in mind the
population may be split differently for
example number of years ago Minnesota
passed a law that said you had to get
people's permission to use their data
and it turned out Rochester was doing a
lot of work also in breast cancer
particularly other women well in
Minnesota it was very disproportionately
young women who decided to opt out of
having their data share well as a result
of that nobody could do research because
their sample sizes were picking up and
obviously I think that's the challenge
it sounds kind of good from a patient
autonomy point of view but I don't think
it's any way to get discovery in an era
where big data where you really can try
to get to the core of things and create
real cures now if you're talking about
certain areas i'm not saying that as you
formerly a bad idea but but it's as if
we only have one arrow you could shoot
frankly I think we need to decide that
as a society we care enough about each
other that we're going to share our data
to cure think so all of us can live
longer and let better life and also by
the way have a cheaper health care
system which we clearly need as well so
i don't know if that's responsive but
that's a quick engine now that's great
answer well Donna I I think the students
of have really gotten some tremendous
insights here from from someone who's
been obviously one of the great thinkers
about this for many decades now and I
appreciate you sharing those insights
with the students and taking the time
with us thank you very well very
gracious I enjoy we can get together and
obviously hope that can happen more
often in the future if this particular
student does have a question that then
care to write to me about I I'm not on
saying how quickly i get back to them
but network virginia.edu and untried to
respond and i'll also send a few
references to you that might be
potentially useful all right well thank
you very much yeah thank you have a good
day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
