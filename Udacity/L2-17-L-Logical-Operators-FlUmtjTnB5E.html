we're offering the same discount to
three different groups of people people
15 years old or younger greater than but
not exactly six years old and people who
are students we're having to repeat our
discount three separate times and in
programming it's always a good idea to
reduce a repetitive code and in this
case we can Java gives us a way to get
rid of repetition by combining each of
these three checks into one larger test
condition we want to test all three
conditions and apply the discount if a
person matches any one of them the
condition we want to test is if a person
is 15 years old or younger or greater
than 6 years old or if that person is a
student and if they're any of these we
offer them the discount we can form this
larger test in Java by using logical
operators there are three main logical
operators and which is these two
ampersand symbols or which is these two
straight lines and not an exclamation
point which may look familiar from how
we checked if some value was not equal
to something else
both aunt and or operators combined to
test conditions or boolean expressions
at a time into one larger expression
like is 3 less than 5 and is 2 greater
than 15 and combinations like this one
are only true when both tests it
combines so the expressions to the left
and to the right of the + symbol are
also true in other words it checks at
the left and the right expressions are
both true so in this example the test is
3 less than 5 is true but on the right 2
is not greater than 15 so this
expression evaluates to false and
because just one of these expressions is
false this whole and combination will
evaluate to false an or operator also
combines two tests but will evaluate to
true when one or both of its two
expressions are true so it checks if
it's left expression or if it's right
expression is true and if at least one
of them is then the or combination will
also be true so for the same combination
of expressions this one true and this
one false combined with an or this whole
expression will evaluate to true
and finally the not operator works on
one test at a time
and negates whatever value it's applied
to which means that it turns a boolean
value or expression into its opposite
value for example saying not three less
than five is the same thing as saying
not this true expression and not true
is equivalent to false which this
expression evaluates to and we'll see
more examples of these operators in
action in a bit and now if we use these
three operators to connect expressions
we can combine as many as we want into
one larger test and that's what we'll
want to do for our museum code in the
case of our museum ticket discount we're
checking three separate test conditions
first if someone's age is less than or
equal to 15 years old then if their age
is greater than 60 and finally if a
person is a student and we can combine
all these conditions into one big
boolean expression by using - or
operators these operators will say that
if a single one of the age or student
conditions is met then we can apply the
discount and in code that looks like
this
our first or combines our two age
conditions and the second combines those
with our student condition and this
checks if age is less than or equal to
15 or age is greater than 60 or if
someone is a student and if any one of
those three conditions is true we'll
inch our if block of code and set our
ticket to a discount price of five and
it's as simple as that
it's each of our previous conditions
that we tested separated by logical
operators and as long as each test
condition is separated by an and or an
or you can create as long of tests as
you want let's see some more examples of
these combined test conditions to
understand and or and not better</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
