in objective-c and Swift may seem pretty
different but errors actually travel
between the two languages remarkably
well in objective-c returning a false
value in this case would constitute an
error now you might think that this bull
returned value could cause a problem but
Swift doesn't have to bother with the
bull let's take a look at how an error
causing function like this one would be
translated in Swift if we look in the
generated header we see that the Swift
version of the method doesn't have a
bull it just throws an error that can be
caught just like any other Swift style
error would be caught also notice that
there's no more error parameter and the
width error at the end of the method
name has been removed in objective-c an
error can also be signaled when a method
with an error parameter returns an
lvalue let's take a look at the
generated header for this perform some
action on string method now as a swift
developer I'm sure your ears perked up
at the mention of an ill value but don't
worry we can handle that nail value in
the same way we would handle any other
error throwing function that returns a
value with the try ? construct notice
that the return type for this function
is just a plain old string not an
optional since Swift's generally uses
enums for errors it's straightforward to
catch specific errors and define
customized responses and you can still
do this when your code is consuming NS
errors with a defined set of common
error codes that is even though nserror
doesn't encode errors as enums the
properties of nserror have been defined
such that the most common errors can be
accessed using dot syntax like so you
can find a list of the available NS
error codes in the foundation constants
reference linked in the accompanying
text the bottom line when you're swift
code is consuming errors from
objective-c is that apart from using the
class name nserror you can pretty much
treat an NS error as you would treat a
swift error</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
