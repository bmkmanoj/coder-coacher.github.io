equation if we subtract 4 from both
sides we're going to isolate the
absolute value will get the distance of
P plus 3 alone this is where the eight
shows up the absolute value or the
distance of P plus 3 from zero must be
eight when solving absolute value
equations we need to make sure we get
the absolute value symbol on one side of
the equation alone that way we can
represent the distance once we isolate
the absolute value we want to check we
want to make sure that it's greater than
or equal to 0 remember distance is
always positive so if we had a negative
answer on this side there wouldn't be
any number that can make it true there'd
be no solution this is a difficult
concept and it's one that will stumble
upon two later so now we're back into
the same case before the value of P plus
three could be eight units to the left
of 0 at negative eight or it could be
eight units to the right of zero at
positive eight so let's split this
equation up into two equations setting p
plus 3 equal to negative 8 and p plus 3
equal to positive 8 just like from
before and at this point you might even
be able to solve it in your head which
is great for more complicated questions
it's best to stick to the equation
solving subtracting 3 from both sides p
q equal 5 and subtracting 3 from both
sides p kit equal negative 11 so the
solution set are the values for P are
negative 11 and 5 and just like all our
other equations we can check these
values in our original equation to see
for right that's one of the beauties of
mathematics this can help build your
confidence in math if these don't check
maybe it's a good idea to look back at
your work you might rethink your process
or catch a small error</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
