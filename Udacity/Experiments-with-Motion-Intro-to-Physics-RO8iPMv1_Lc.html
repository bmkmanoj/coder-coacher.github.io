today the objects fall at a constant
speed had been around for almost 2,000
years by the time Galileo came around
this idea had a lot of as we say in
physics and inertia it was going to be
very difficult to change if we add to
that the fact that feathers fall at
constant speed Galileo had a pretty
difficult task ahead of him
now Galilei had a proposal for why
feathers do actually fall at constant
speed he thought that some resistance
provided by the air would actually slow
objects down and for lightweight objects
like feathers this has a huge effect and
causes them to fall at more or less a
constant speed now the rumor is that
Galileo's experiments involve him
dropping objects off of the Leaning
Tower of Pisa it's quite possible that
he did this but it seems unlikely that
he would have gotten good results since
as we talked about before
freefall motion is just too fast which
brings up the question how can we slow
motion down this seems like an essential
aspect to doing any meaningful
experiment with motion so should we drop
objects through water or some other
liquid to slow them down should we roll
objects down inclined planes and an
inclined plane is just another word for
a ramp or should we still drop our
objects through the air but just attach
a parachute to them to slow them down
and I want you to tell me the best
answer and there is only one year so
this might require some thought keep in
mind some of the points made over here
when you're answering this question</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
