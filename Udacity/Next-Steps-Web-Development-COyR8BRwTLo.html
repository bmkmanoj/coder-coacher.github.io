steps you know we've learned a lot of
server-side technology introduction to
programming type things where do our
students go from here and what would you
recommend they learn next sure so i
would start getting good at two tubemate
technologies one is javascript which is
a completely separate programming
language from anything we've talked
about in this class and that it runs in
the browser and so you can make your
webpage do fancy things and the other
CSS this is you know I've had some CSS
and the homeworks and in the lectures
but I've never quizzed you guys on it
because we don't know how to even great
SS yet and this is how you describe what
your pages look like colors and font
sizes and boxes and layout and all that
sort of stuff so this will make you know
basically everything you've learned in
this class you know you can make a
pretty substantial website with
everything you've learned on this class
up until this point and with JavaScript
and CSS you can make your website look
more professional and you know look more
like a website but functionally you can
do all the major things so JavaScript
CSS if you learn those you'll have a lot
of tools in your toolbox okay great I
think though that's all the questions we
had and unit 6 and homework 6 has just
been posted anything you want to say
about that or about week 7 in the final
so you know unix is caching basically
101 ways to use memcache that should be
fun one the homework should be pretty
straightforward I think and then unit 7
no more quizzes and unit 7 it's
basically we're just going to talk about
a lot of the real world stuff we did
with a growing reddit and we'll talk to
some of the Udacity engineers about how
they use App Engine in production and
then the final is basically going to be
building another website similar to your
blog but this time all at once and we'll
talk all about that and units mmm one
last question i just remembered was how
to prep for the final and i would
recommend personally that you just make
sure you have all the homework done in
the understand it if you have those
things done i would say the final really
shouldn't be bad yeah if you've done the
homeworks final shouldn't be any problem
in fact after i wrote the final code
about two-thirds of that code
is from homeworks you know the user
registration stuff the caching stuff
it's all you know you'll find yourself
when you're writing any web application
a lot of that that a lot of that code
will get reused over and over again
that's why we thought it no so yeah if
you can do the homeworks you shouldn't
have any problem on the finals okay
great will help see any see you in class
all right bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
