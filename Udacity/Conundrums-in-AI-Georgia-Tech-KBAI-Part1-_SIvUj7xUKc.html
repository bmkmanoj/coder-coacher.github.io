discussing some of the biggest problems
in AI we obviously are not going to
solve all of them today but it's good to
start with a big picture ai has several
conundrums I'm going to describe five of
the main ones today conundrum number one
all intelligent agents have limited
computational resources processing speed
memory size and so on but most
interesting AI problems are
computationally intractable how then can
we get AI agents to give us near
real-time performance on many
interesting problems current remember to
all computation is local but most air
problems of global constraints how then
can we get AI agents to address global
problems using only local computation
conundrum number three combinational
logic is fundamentally deductive but
many error problems are abductive or
inductive in their nature how can we get
AI agents to address abductive or
inductive problems if you do not
understand some of these terms like
abduction don't worry about it
we'll discuss it later in the class
conundrum number four the world is
dynamic knowledge is limited but an air
agent must always begin with what
already knows how then can an air agent
ever address a new problem kernel number
five problem solving reasoning and
learning a complex enough but
explanation and justification add to the
complexity how then can we get an air
agent to ever explain or justify its
decisions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
