about arrays we learned that arrays are
ordered lists of items and that they can
have duplicates for example here's my
array of favorite things and you can see
that raindrops on roses appears twice
and that's totally okay because arrays
are ordered we're able to access its
items by index you can see here that
we're accessing the first item with the
index 0 and we're accessing the fourth
item with the index 3 we also in over
three different ways to initialize an
array first using somewhat verbose
syntax second by specifying the item
type between square brackets and third
using an array literal we also saw than
in Swift arrays have types meaning that
they can hold any type you desire but
they can't hold two items that have
different types for example I can't add
a variable of type string to an array of
type light switch we also practiced
using array operations let's see those
one more time here I have an array of
musicians and I can append an artist to
the end of my musicians array using the
method append and I can insert another
artist at a particular index using
insert at index and over here you can
see des love at index 2 to remove an
item from the array i use remove at
index if i remove the item at index 3
you can see Flo Rida's removed if I want
to know how many items are in my array i
use the count method right now I've got
five and finally if I want to retrieve
an item at a particular index I can use
subscript syntax like so and here we can
see the third item is des loaf we also
win over copying and concatenating
arrays array concatenation and Swift is
super convenient we just use the +
operator and we're good to go to copy an
array we just define our copy to be
equal to the value of the original
arrays our value types which means that
here array and array copy represent two
distinct entities if I change a value in
array copy you can see that the values
in array remain the same there are
exceptions to this which you'll learn
more about in the session on classes and
final
we talked about how to use fast
enumeration to loop through an array for
in loops take the general form for item
in collection and then between curly
braces the statements you want to
execute on each item in the collection
for example to find the sum of all the
ins in this array we just type for value
in inter a and this statement adding int
to the sum will be executed for each
member of the collection you can see in
the playground sidebar that this
statement is being executed five times
and here we can see the sum</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
