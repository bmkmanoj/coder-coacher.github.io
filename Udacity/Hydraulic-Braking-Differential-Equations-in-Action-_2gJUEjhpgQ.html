you to implement the control algorithm
that you saw in sections 14 and 15 of
unit five for the hydraulic braking
system we set up a number of important
values for you as always including two
things called low slip and high slip
these are both possible values for the
wheel slip and if the wheel slip gets
smaller than low slip we want you to
decrease the pressure of the brakes
similarly if the wheel slip gets higher
than high slip we want you to increase
the pressure increasing and decreasing
the pressure like this leads to a rate
of change called hydraulic speed in the
strength be of the brake hydraulic speed
is shown right here now be the breaking
strength which you can see right here is
measured as the deceleration of the
velocity of the rim of the wheel if
there was no friction from the road as
would be logical the strength of the
brake cannot be a negative number and
we've set a maximum value that it can
take on with this constant called max
break right here you've given you most
of the contents of the for loop inside
this function but there are a couple of
lines left we want you to write we want
you to model how the brake pressure
changes between these maximum and
minimum values that we outlined above
and using this how the brake
acceleration changes step by step this
might require a little bit of creativity
so if you need some hints come to the
forums</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
