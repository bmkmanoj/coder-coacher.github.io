a pretty important concept in math in
general especially when we're talking
about graphing and that is symmetry we
talked about this to a certain extent
when we were dealing with quadratic
functions like y equals x squared we
said that if you have a parabola like
this one we know that we can draw a line
that goes straight through its vertex
such that if you folded the parabola in
half along this line then it would map
directly onto itself in other words at
any point along this middle line this
axis of symmetry the points on the
parabola directly to the left or right
of it are equidistant from the axis so
if I'm at this position for example this
Y value then the distance in the X
direction from here to here is the same
in terms of absolute value as a distance
from here to here now it seems looking
at these other even functions like a
similar kind of symmetry applies to them
one question is do add functions have
symmetry as well and in both cases how
do we mathematically express that
symmetry about to give you a kind of
complex quiz that's going to require a
fair amount of critical thinking and
some new material so this is definitely
going to be a major challenge problem so
if we know that a point that we're going
to call X comma Y is on a given graph
what if we find out that the point
negative X comma Y is also on that graph
what does that say about this graph does
that mean that this represents an even
function or an odd function or neither
of these think about which of the graphs
either on this plane or this plane this
property applies to and you can even
test it out with real points</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
