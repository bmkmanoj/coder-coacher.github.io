platform and one of the best places to
see it in action is doing replies to
notifications normally when you touch
the reply action on a phone it will take
you to an activity to enter the text on
Android where the user can touch this
reply button and then speak a reply and
it is then converted into a string and
delivered to your app best of all you
can use this feature with just a few
lines of code added to your existing
notifications on the phone we use a
class called remote input to implement
this we declare a string extra voice
reply that specifies the key that will
be delivered to the intent later on we
also declare a label to put on the text
reply screen telling the user what we
want them to speak to us you then call
build to get the remote input object now
we need to add the remote input to our
notification you can see here we declare
a pending intent to receive the reply we
then create an action and then we use
add remote input to use the remote input
object we created earlier then we use
extend on the notification to add a
wearable extender add action and then
the action we just created everything is
now linked together and we can issue the
notification this code will continue to
work on a phone but now we can have a
reply action that asks the user to speak
a reply so how do we get the reply
string back the previous code is written
to use an activity called reply activity
inside there you can call get intent to
find details about the intent that
started the activity once you have the
intent you can pass it to the get
message text method shown here we can
then extract out the voice reply using
the key extra voice reply which returns
a char sequence that was spoken by the
user and that's it it's that easy speech
recognition has traditionally been very
hard to do by yourself and Android wear
takes care of all of it for you there is
also support for emoji entry on Android
wear and these are automatically handled
on the wearable and sent to your app as
standard emoji unicode characters you
don't always have to use voice replies
sometimes your user will be unable to
speak to the watch and they might want
to apply with a set of pre can replace
you can use the set choices method to
specify an array of options that the
user can select from
be used along with a voice reply and
here is how you define the array in the
strings.xml file it contains a set of
strings that will be given to the extra
voice replied defined earlier one more
thing to note here if you're using the
Android wear emulator you'll have to
type your voice replies on a keyboard
since the emulator does not support
speech recognition</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
