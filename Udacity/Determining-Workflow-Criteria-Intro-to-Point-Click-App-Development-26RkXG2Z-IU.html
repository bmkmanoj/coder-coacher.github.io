know create new workflow so what should
I do
so the new rule button is actually
creating a new workflow and what that
means when it says new rule is you're
going to set up a set of criteria
that'll cause this to happen so trigger
it's it's basically there's another hang
in Salesforce called a trigger which is
why I'm trying to steer away from but a
trigger is just a workflow made of code
so what we're doing right now is we're
creating a situation that will only fire
when a certain set of criteria is made
and that's why it's called a rule okay
and so in this case let's say this is
going to be on the maintenance ticket
object because it's going to be what a
maintenance ticket is created that's
when we're going to fire this rule Oh
mean it's ticket next all right so I
guess I'll call the rule alert
technician okay
and I want to evaluate the rule when a
record is what does this mean evaluate
the rule so it's only going to run this
rule when you the rule means the
workflow the four steps exactly so in
this case what we're going to eventually
do is send an email and a task to a
technician okay but this is asking when
should we do that what should we do that
every time a maintenance ticket is
created every time it's created and
every time it's edited or every time
it's created and it meets this rule
criteria yeah but it's edited in a
certain way if it didn't meet the
criteria first and then it meets this
rule criteria after it's been edited
fire it gotcha gotcha so in this case I
think we would want the last the last of
the three which is every time it's
created and if it's edited to then meet
this criteria like um I wouldn't want to
send an email or try to send email if
the technician didn't have a valid email
address or something like that yeah
all right so I'm going to run rules the
following criteria are met so the
technician has an email address that's
what I'm going for right okay so I see
maintenance ticket technician but I
really want the email field yep but I
don't see that here is that should I
just click technician or what am i doing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
