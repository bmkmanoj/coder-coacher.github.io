other examples that I could come up with
and we could talk about but I think that
I think I've sort of made the point yeah
that's really neat I mean you know again
it feels you know not to be dissing on
my homie King Solomon but it's like
namesake mm-hmm and now what homey means
in some in geddes yes okay fine so um
but again you know if B is rich enough
bees just buying the baby and not even
paying a appropriately for the baby well
it'd be as rich enough he probably just
bought a baby yeah but bought the baby
for the vent for what for the valve for
it Oh for it for bees own value of the
baby so it has to be the case that
virile is greater than be fake or all of
this fail yeah but let's just say it is
no but it's not them will come over some
other design and actually by the way
there are mechanisms for solving this
where you don't know what the VAT it may
be the case it fakes greater than real
but you sort of limit the possible
values that each might get you kind of
think there's like a distribution of
them and they're clever things that you
can do to kind of to sort of make this
work but well beyond the scope of this
single slide which we've done all of
this on one slide ok so it's well below
this in a little more yeah there's just
there's just no more room on the slide
so I can't talk about anymore so I think
speaking of game theory and true values
we have a problem all right what's the
problem the problem we have is that
we've now come to the the part of the
lesson where we have to say what have we
learned and one of us drives any other
talks great but we both did things in
this lesson oh so I'm going to say that
we kept switching turns in order to make
parity work you should do the what're we
learn</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
