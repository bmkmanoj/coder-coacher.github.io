a tester which can detect when any state
is identical to a previously visited
state in that case the testament decide
that this this and this state are
identical to the initial state and
therefore dismissed the tester also
dismisses this state as usual because of
the problem specification that one
cannot have more prisoners and guards on
any one bank this leaves the following
state of affairs note also that this
particular state has no successor states
all successor states or this have been
ruled out therefore this particular part
clearly is not a good path to get to the
goal state if we notice also that these
two states are identical then we can
merge them if we do so then we get
exactly the same kind of configuration
of states that we had when we were
dealing with the semantic Network in the
previous lesson there is something to
note here we had the semantic network in
the last lesson but the knowledge
representation of semantic network while
very useful by itself and off itself
doesn't solve any problem you need a
problem-solving method that uses
knowledge afforded by the knowledge
representation to actually do the
problem-solving
generating test is one of those
problem-solving methods in general when
we do problem-solving or reasoning then
there is a coupling between a knowledge
representation and a problem-solving
method like semantic networks and
generate and test what we did so far had
a dump generator but we made the tester
smarter the testers started looking for
what states had been repeated
alternatively we can shift the balance
of responsibility between them and make
the generator smarter let's see how that
might happen</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
