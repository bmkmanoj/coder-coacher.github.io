changed after we did this last
modification and actually there is
something that I would like to do here
because looking at this a little bit
more I noticed that there are two
attributes renewed and due date that we
have in loanable item right but they
don't seem to be really attributes or
characteristics of loanable item that
there are more characteristics of the
association between the loanable item
and patron wouldn't you agree well yeah
it's not like you can only renew a book
once in its entirety that's right
exactly exactly so that's that's why
what I like to do is that I would like
to move those out of the loanable item
and actually there is a contract that we
can use it to express this it's called
we haven't seen it yet but the spatial
kind of class it's called an association
class so it's a class that is connected
to a specific Association so what we can
do here we can create this class which
I'm going to call checked out I'm gonna
associate it with this Association I'm
going to connect it with this
Association and then I'm going to move
the due date and the renewed attributes
from the loanable item here in this
checked out class so in this way seems
to me that it makes it very explicit for
somebody looking at this class diagram
that these characteristics are
characteristics of the loan and not of
the of the elements involved in the loan
and can you do the same thing with fine
isn't fine a property of the loan yeah
actually it is right because a fine is a
fine for a specific loan right that's
correct okay so the yeah then we can do
that we don't need to represent fine as
a class we can just transform that into
an attribute that we can put into the
checked out Association class gotcha
anything else yeah it occurred to me
that there's another thing that happens
in one of my scenarios I I put down
about the patron actually returning
returning an item right okay so we would
probably need an additional operation I
guess I got the patron right so okay so
what I'm going to do that's pretty easy
to do I'm just gonna add
return operation here in the patron and
when that happens that will mean that
I'll get rid of this association class
because the the item is returned that
right well what happens if somebody
drops the book in the book drop but
doesn't pay the if it's overdue and
doesn't pay the fine will that get rid
of the information about what they owe
always see so you can have the item
being available but you still want to
know whether there's kind of any pending
fine fines on the on the book and how
much those fines are and how do you
compute how much it is it's it's how
many days it was from the time it was
due to when they paid to when they
returned it I see okay so you know what
we can do I think we can put an
additional attribute in the checked out
class and I'm gonna call it when we
turned and that item will have either a
special value or it will contain the
date in which the book was returned so
in this way you should be able to kind
of keep this in the system until it's
paid and also to compute how much the
fine is is that was that what so the the
special value is is for normal situation
when they haven't they don't know
anything and haven't returned it yet
exactly so that will tell us that they
know that the loan is still active
basically great does that work for you
yes and you know I like this I mean I
feel pretty good about it that I think
we have a nice class diagram so what I
would like to do is just go off and
clean it up a little bit and put it in a
you know ID so that I can I can pretty
print it and rearrange things a little
bit and then I like to sit down again
and just go through through it for the
last time and for some final
considerations so if you don't mind
we'll just take a 10-minute break and
reconvene here that's fine all right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
