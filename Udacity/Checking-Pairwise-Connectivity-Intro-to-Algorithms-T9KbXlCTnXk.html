component sizes algorithm from the
previous example call the algorithm
check connection and it takes the graph
but it also takes v1 and v2 it's going
to do something similar to before it's
going to start off with the assumption
that none of the none of the nodes have
been marked so far as reachable then
we're going to call marked component on
that graph and the node that we're going
to start marking from is v1 and what
that's going to do when this when this
returns it's going to return a number of
what we're just going to ignore it it's
going to go through starting v1 and mark
like basically touch every node that can
be reached from v1 and we want to find
out whether or not there's a connection
to v2 and that's really easy at this
point the answer is v2 in so what this
does is it checks whether the node V 2
that it was that we've been given as
input was one of the nodes that got
marked when when we were spreading
things out from v1 so it starts at v1
spreads things through the graph like
some kind of an infection or a good idea
and when that's all through all we have
to do is look to see whether v2 is one
of the things that got infected in the
spread so according to this a and G are
connected let's take a look back at the
graph G is reachable from a but that's
not so exciting to think about because
they were pretty much connected directly
its try a more interesting one say H and
be so it it realizes that HMV are in
fact connected and that's more
interesting because it requires multiple
hops to get from one to the other and
then finally we can do a and B we know
that they're in different components
because remember there there was
component a with four nodes and
component B with four nodes but let's
make sure that the program can figure
that out yes indeed so when it spread
things out from a reached everywhere it
could reach be was not among the visited</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
