code for main dish it has an init method
and Astor method what we want to do with
appetizer is almost the same thing so
let's start by cutting pasting that code
so here's the code from the main dish in
it will cut and paste that in the
appetizer and now we need to account for
one little difference which instead of
having sides the appetizer has a number
of people that it serves we also need to
implement the store method for the main
dish we're printing out the name a star
if it's vegetarian or not the
description if it has one and the price
and you'll notice I'm using conditional
expressions here which is something you
might not have seen before we haven't
introduced it yet in this class this is
similar to an if statement except in
this case it's an expression that means
it produces a value so we can use it in
an assignment in this case giving value
to default parameter and what it means
is if the value of the if test is true
the value of the expression is what we
put before the if otherwise it's what we
put after the else so in this case we'll
get the star if self d'Ovidio therrien
is true otherwise we'll get nothing this
is what we did to implement stir for the
main dish for the surf function we want
to do exactly the same thing for
appetizer as we did for main dish so we
can cut and paste this code</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
