okay well basically the idea is you
you're gonna cost together all the data
points that are in an attraction basin
of one mode so what's an attraction
basin an attraction Basin is the region
for which all the trajectories lead to
the same mode or all the points go there
all right so here's a very simple
example so here is a set of points drawn
from a distribution and you can tell
obviously that the idea is that there
probably is a mode here and there's a
mode there great the question is which
points belong to which mode and that's
done very simply by if you were to start
your mean shift in each of these
locations which mode does it end up at
all right and that's illustrated in this
figure here right so here we're showing
you the area at which all of the the
mean shifts get to this mode the mode on
the right likewise everywhere over here
they get to the mode on the left so it
clusters your feature space using these
basins of attraction to the two modes
all right so when we're gonna do this
for segmenting a color image what we
have to do is define some feature so
maybe we're using just U and V or maybe
UV and XY if we wanted color and
location we have to initialize the
window the windows at every pixel that
is every possible color point in that l
UV space now would you do everyone know
you would take a sampling of them you do
mean shift until it converges and then
you merge all the pixels all those
initial points into a single cluster
that all end up at the same peak all
right and so that looks a little bit
like this all right so here L and U this
is l and V okay these are the actual
pixel colors distributed and if you run
your clustering and here it's being done
in this Lu space all right if you run
your mean shift here okay
you will see see all these points going
up to that peak right there and then
there's a peak here and a peak here and
a peak here those let's see 1 2 3 4 5 6
7 so there's seven a modes here and that
means there's seven basins of attraction
which means you would end up with seven
regions in the image</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
