translation tables work so I'm going to
define a variable called table that's
using the string dot make trans function
which makes a translation table and I'm
going to translate from the characters a
b c 2 1 2 3 i can give any number of
characters here the characters i want to
replace and the ones i want to replace
them with and i should say that this is
using the string module so somewhere we
have to say import string before we
start doing any of this you only have to
do that import once of course now I'm
going to define a formula f to be simple
formula a plus B equals C and then I'm
going to call the translate method of
the formula f and pass it this
translation table and that will evaluate
to the string 1 plus two equals three so
it's taken each of the elements in the
table and they correspond a 2 1 B 2 2 C
2 3 substituted those into F and given
me back a brand new string and now if I
go ahead and evaluate F dot translate of
table which is one plus two equals three
then that will give me the result true
because one plus two is three and that's
a legal Python expression now what I
want you to do is to define for me the
function valid which takes a filled-in
formula like one plus two equals three
filled in formula f and returns true or
false true if the formula is in fact
valid if it represents a true equation
like this
false if it represents an invalid
equation like one plus three equals
three or it should also return false if
it represents an error like 1 divided by
0 equals 3 that wouldn't return to or
false that would signal an error and I
want you to handle that within the code
for valid and I'll give you a hint which
is you should consider using a try
statement so try do something and then
you can say except 0 division error
something so what that does is it
executes the main body in which you can
test if evaluating this expression f is
true or not and return appropriately but
if the expression if evaluating the
expression f causes a 0 division error
then this clause will catch it and then
you can do the appropriate thing here
you should also think about if there's
anything else that can go wrong with in
the execution of valid here's my version
of the solution so in defining valid
takes a filled-in formula f and it's
going to return true main the main part
is if we evaluate f and if that's true
then we should return true but I also
had to check for the 0 division error
and even to be a little bit more sure
here I ended up checking for arithmetic
error which is a superclass of 0
division error it covers a few
additional things like overflow of
really big numbers you didn't have to do
that would have been fine to just catch
the 0 division error and if there is
such an error then you should return
false but I did one more thing here and
it looks kind of complicated so I'm
using a regular expression search and
let's look at exactly what's going on in
this confusing part of the clause here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
