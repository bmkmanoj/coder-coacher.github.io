actually add them to other strings this
is called string concatenation and it's
basically joining strings together to
build a longer string say for example
the drivers first name was Hamish and
the last name was Blake here I've
declared two different variables drivers
first name and drivers last name and
I've initialized the drivers first name
to be Hamish at a drivers last name to
be Blake now we can actually do
something like this where I've created a
new string called driver full name and
it is actually equal to just the sum of
those two strings driver first name plus
drivers last name what this plus is
doing is it's just joining this variable
string here to this variable string
there so I'm expecting that the driver
full name string would have the string
Hamish blake in it let's print it out
using the system.out.print line
statement to see what's inside and the
output that I get is Hamish Blake oh it
seemed like it didn't put a space
between them though well this is because
I've just joined those two strings
together which didn't have any spaces in
them and that's what this string
concatenation does it just joins those
strings without doing anything extra so
let's see how we can add an extra
whitespace in here so what I'm actually
doing is I'm concatenated the first name
plus a string that has the whitespace in
it plus another string which has the
last name in it which made our output
become Hamish space Plake perfect you
can also use string concatenation to
join strings with numbers this trick is
very handy when printing out some
information using the print line
statement
remember this example where we declared
the stops and fare variables and we kept
on updating them well if we wanted to
print out the variable stops and fair we
can just add two different print line
instructions and the output would be
three and 15 like so but what if we
wanted to print out something like this
the bus made $15 after three stops a
full sentence that
has both the variables values in it this
can be done using a command like that
it's just a normal print line command
but it has a lot of string concatenation
inside let's investigate it step by step
the first bar here is string literal
which is just strings within quotation
marks so that's going to be printed out
exactly as we typed it in all the way
from the bus made and the new dollar
sign like so and then we have this plus
sign which is concatenating something
this happened to be the variable fare so
Java would actually go and look up
what's inside that variable fare because
it's not surrounded by quotation marks
and it will print out the value stored
inside which happened to be 15 and then
another string concatenation happening
here but this time is concatenating this
string literal after so that gets
printed out exactly as it is and then
another string concatenation with the
variable stops so Java goes and looks up
what's stored inside the variable stops
which happen to be 3 and that's what
gets printed out and then finally the
string literal stops so with this
instruction our output becomes the bus
made $15 after 3 stops if each of those
variables had different values in it
then the output would have changed
notice how I've added some space inside
some of the string literals here but I
didn't add a space for example after
that dollar sign this is because I
wanted no spaces between the dollar sign
and the number here but I do want spaces
before and after the word after which I
did down there same goes for the word
stops I just added an hour of space
before that as well so remember that
Java would only consider spaces inside
the quotation marks and if you don't put
them then words would be close to each
other without any spaces in between
fantastic so now you know how to use
string concatenation to join strings
together or even join variables with
strings</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
