enrolling him my only experience with a
programming language was a bit of
JavaScript in JavaScript there are a lot
of brackets and semicolons to mark the
end of statements but there seems to be
none of that in Python
I was just wondering how Python knows
that you are done defining your
procedure and that it should carry on
with the rest of the program is it all
about the indentation thanks for the
question storm run we notice in Python
that the whitespace actually matters and
this is different from many language
those of you have programmed in other
languages like Java or JavaScript or C
know that you have to have lots of
syntax to tell the compiler where
statements end and where blocks in and
begin where you have some my colons and
you have squiggly brackets and you have
other things in your code that are
really there just to help the compiler
know where things begin and end in
Python whitespace is used for that so
the new lines matter the indenting
matters and the Python interpreter knows
when a block ends based on where the
indenting is that's really nice in the
sense that it makes it easy to read your
code you don't have to worry about
adding brackets and things and if you
look at someone else's code or you look
at your own code the structure of the
code tells you what the code means
because it has to have the same
indenting structure as the blocks that
are interpreted by the Python
interpreter this sometimes it causes
problems and this is why many languages
don't pay any attention to whitespace
that if you copy code between different
editors or you change things that change
the whitespace well in Python that
changes the meaning of your code so you
have to be careful that you don't change
the indenting or don't change where the
new line breaks are and things like that
because in Python that can actually
change the meaning of your code but it
is a handy way of making it clearer than
interpreter as well as two human reading
the code the structure of the code and
it saves having to need any extra syntax
like squiggly braces or semicolons to do
that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
