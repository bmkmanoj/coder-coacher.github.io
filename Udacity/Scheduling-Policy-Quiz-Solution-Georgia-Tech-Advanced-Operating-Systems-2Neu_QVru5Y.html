which to place T why based on the
scheduling policy now if you ask the
question what is the minimum i + q 4p
you for this particular thread t why
that's going to be the affinity that t y
has on PU the affinity the th ey has on
PU is too but also we have to look at
the queue size and the queue size of PU
is one there's only one thread sitting
there so the overall min of i plus q 40
y with respect to pu is 3 let's do the
same thing for t y on TV in the case of
pv its affinity apparently is higher
because there's only one intervening
task that ran since the last time ki y
ran on it that's good news but we also
have to look at the queue of pv wen py
gets put on PV skew it has to sit behind
whatever they may be already and in the
case of PV the queue already has four
threads to run so when t y is put on PV
skew it's going to be stuck at the end
of this queue which means that in a
sense the amount of intervention that is
going to happen for dy on PV by the time
it gets to run is actually the size of
the affinity index for t y with respect
to pv currently as well as the
intervention that's going to happen by
the time it actually gets to run so
that's four so the overall I plus Q is 5
for this guy and three for this guy
which means that the choice I'm going to
make is to put dy on PU because that's
the one that will result in the least
amount of intervention for polluting the
cache of PU with respect to this
particular thread key why</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
