start out by keeping track of the
results in a list which is initially the
empty list and keeping track of the max
value initially we don't have any now
the key function I'm either gonna Li use
the key function you provided me or if
you didn't I'm going to use the function
that just Maps a an argument to itself
and that's what this notation here
lambda X maps to X means the function
that map's the function to itself and
then I'm going to go through the
iterable for each X I come up with an x
value which I get by applying the key
and if the x value is greater than the
max value so far or if I don't have a
result yet at all and and that would be
the case if I'm at the first element of
the iterable then then I want to create
the result to be this list of the single
item X the value that are the first one
that I've looked at and I want to set
the max value to be equal to that X
value if it's a tie then I just want to
append X onto the resist of results that
I've been building up all along and then
at the end I want to return the result
now of course I should write tests for
this as well just as I always did and
now that I have all max and I have my
new version of poker
I've also got to write a new
documentation string here so I've
written a new documentation string for
poker to say that it's returned a list
of the winning hands rather than a
single winning hand
I had the definition in terms of all max
I should write more tax tests for all
Max I should go back and change the
tests for poker so that instead of
returning a single hand they return a
list of the single hand for the test I
have so far and then I should also add
some more tests where there are some
ties and make sure that it handles that
properly once I've done that it looks
like I'm done</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
