first talk about internet services an
Internet service is any type of service
that's accessible via web interface from
checking current weather conditions at
twitter.com to searching or checking
email via Google search and mail
services to making online bank
transactions or flight reservations the
common way in which these services are
used is end-user sent web requests via
web browsers and then receive a response
most commonly these types of services
are the composed into three components a
presentation component that interfaces
with the end-users it's typically
responsible for static content related
to the webpage layout a business logic
component this is a component that
integrates all of the business specific
processing and this would be all of the
dynamic user specific content and then a
component that deals with all of the
data storage and management typically in
a database these components are commonly
referred to as the presentation the
business and the database tiers although
these are separate components they're
not always implemented as separate
processes running on separate machines
what makes sense will depend on the
service complexity the resource
requirements expected loads and also on
the underlying technologies that are
used for instance the Apache HTTP web
server can be used to implement both the
presentation logic to serve static
content and also as part of the same
process PHP modules for PHP processing
can be used to generate the dynamic
content there in fact many open source
as well as proprietary solutions that
are available that offer our
technologies for either one of these
tiers to put these applications using
these kinds of tiers together
there are various integrative software
or other middleware components that are
used that provide commonly used
functionality messaging services service
configuration and management security
accounting some persistence guarantees
recovery management and many others one
important point to make is that for
services that are organized as multiple
processes the inter process
communication among those processes is
carried out via some form of IP
seemed such as our PC or RM I'm for Java
based architectures as well as some use
of optimizations that are based on
shared memory in case the different
processes are running on the same
machine so these are some of the
examples of the inter process
communication mechanisms that we already
discussed in this course and these are
relevant in the context of real-world
deployment of Internet services</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
