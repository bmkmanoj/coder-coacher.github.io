least there have been indications that
team structure can matter a very
interesting study at Microsoft looked
how teams that were responsible for
individual features were composed more
specifically the study would look for
how distant the common manager of a team
was if there would be one direct common
manager for all members of the team that
distance would be one and if they're
common manager would be say two levels
removed then the distance would be two
and if the lowest common manager of a
team would be say Steve Ballmer the
manager of Microsoft then the distance
would be seven or eight or whatever the
number of management level at Microsoft
is now turned out that the higher this
distance was the more defect prone the
modules produced by the team were the
assumption is that if there's no joint
management in a team where every
decision first has to go up to the
highest level and then back again then
this makes teamwork particularly hard it
also makes it hard to make decisions and
it makes it hard to create some common
responsibilities for the module you're
working on this study was made on
Windows Vista and as a result of that
study Microsoft reorganized the teams
for later versions of Windows such that
situations like these what no longer
occur</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
