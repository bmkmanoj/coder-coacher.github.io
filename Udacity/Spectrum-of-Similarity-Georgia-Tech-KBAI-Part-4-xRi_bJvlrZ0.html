at one end of the spectrum the target
problem in the source case are identical
at the other extreme end of the
similarity spectrum the target problem
and the source case have nothing in
common we can evaluate the similarity
between target Parliament source case in
several dimensions in terms of the
relationships occurring in the source
case on the target problem in terms of
the objects are occurring between the
two in terms of the features are the
objects and in terms of the values that
the features of the objects take at the
end of the spectrum with your target
problem in the source case are very
similar your relationships object
features and values are all similar at
the other end the values features an
obvious will be different with
relationships are similar if the
relationships too were different then
there would be nothing in common with in
the target problem in the source case
when the relationships object features
and values are all similar then that is
an example of recording cases and we
have come across it an example of that
was from the colored blocks in the
blocks world when its similarity between
the target problem of the source case is
along the dimensions relationships and
objects but not along the dimensions of
values or values and features then
that's an example of case-based
reasoning we discussed this method at
the domain of navigation in urban areas
the objects are the concept between the
target problem at the source case being
the same means that the domains are the
same so case based reasoning is within
domain analogy an analogical reasoning
in general objects in the target problem
and the source case too might be
different we saw an example of
analogical reasoning in the dunker
radiation problem when we were talking
about cross domain analogical transfer
actually recording cases in case based
reasoning or also example of analogical
reasoning except that they occurred in
the same domain the target problem in
the source cases in same domain which is
why we consider them earlier where
analogical reasoning here we mean
cross-domain analogical transfer as in
the dunker radiation problem</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
