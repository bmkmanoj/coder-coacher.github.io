a procedure add page to index that takes
three inputs the first is the index and
I've drawn the picture of the index to
remind you with structure it's a list
where each entry in the list is a list
containing of the key and a list of the
URLs where that keyword is found the
second input is the URL so that's the
location of the page where the content
came from and the third input is the
content that's the entire text of the
page at that location where the URL is
so the result should be updating the
index to include all the word
occurrences found in the page content by
adding the URL to the words associated
URL list so I'll show you a few examples
so it's clear what add page to index
should do and then you'll have a chance
to define it yourself so we're gonna
start with an empty index and we'll call
add page to index and let's print out
what index looks like after this it's a
little hard to see like that so let's
see what index position 0 is we can see
that the keyword this appears at the URL
fake test if we print index at position
1 we'll see the same thing but this time
for the keyword is so we have an entry
we have an index we have four words in
our index this is a and test and for
each word the list of URLs where that
word appears is fake test which is what
we passed in is URL here let's try
adding some other things to our index
this time we'll add a page called real
test and have the contents of the page
be this is not a test now when we run
this we see this index if we look at a
particular element let's look at element
at position two it has two entries in
its URL list since both of the pages we
passed in contain is and if you look at
index position four we see that for the
word not that only appears on the real
test page so there's only one entry in
its URL list we already defined the
procedure for responding to a query so
that should work on this index let's try
so lookup takes the index and the
keyword and returns the list of URLs at
that keyword
delete the previous tests and see what
happens when we look up is we see that
it occurs on both pages if we look up
Udacity doesn't occur anywhere so far so
I hope it's clear now what add page to
index should you see if you can write
the code to define add page to index</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
