human thought and behaviorist processes
that are driven by both nature and
nurture and this lesson on mental
illness epitomizes the dynamic interplay
between the two that's right and as we
said throughout the course we are like
little chemical factories making
chemicals that help us live successfully
in our environment but as you've seen
from this lesson sometimes there can be
a tragic disconnect between our
individual nature and nurture experience
which can result in mental illness
although this lesson the sobering we
really hope that it shows you to be
thankful the times that you're
experiencing positive mental health
that's right and remember that it's not
unusual for us to experience highs and
lows throughout our life periods of
anxiety or depression but it's when we
don't have these experiences that we
should be fortunate and thankful for our
good mental health now that you can
leave this lesson we hope that you're a
more educated person in terms of mental
health literacy and that any negative
stereotype or stigma that you may have
once had are now diminished or
completely removed we as humans are
unique and fascinating creatures and
it's not uncommon for us to experience
difficulties in the sometimes
challenging world however when those
difficulties manifests themselves
through mental illness that can be
challenging in and of itself however as
we'll see in the next lesson there are a
variety of techniques that can help
reduce the symptoms of mental illness
such that people can live fulfilling
meaningful adventurous and proud lives
there's absolutely no shame in mental
illness and in our next lesson we're
going to learn about the treatments for
mental disorders</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
