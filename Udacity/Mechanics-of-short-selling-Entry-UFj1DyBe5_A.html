mechanics of short-selling pay attention
because it's complicated
okay let's imagine the following
scenario you want to take a short
position in IBM and iBM is currently
selling at $100 that's the current
market price Joe holds a hundred shares
of IBM
he likes IBM he wants to hold on to it
but he's willing to lend you those
shares of IBM in fact Joe's broker will
take care of that for him he may not
even know that he's lending you the
shares let's suppose Lisa thinks that
IBM is gonna go up and she wants to buy
IBM so you want to sell IBM short you
don't own any shares of it Lisa wants to
buy IBM she thinks is gonna go up so
here's what happens you borrow that
hundred shares from Joe now that you
have those shares you can turn around
and sell them to Lisa and in exchange
for those hundred shares that you gave
Lisa she gives you a hundred times $100
or ten thousand dollars so let me recap
that you want to sell IBM short Joe has
a hundred shares of IBM Lisa wants to
buy IBM so you borrow those hundred
shares from Joe you immediately turn
around and sell them to Lisa and you get
$10,000 the result of this transaction
after everything settles is you have
$10,000 in your account but you Oh Joe
100 shares of stock and of course lisa
has 100 shares of stock and so on now
the problem sort of arises here that Joe
may decide he wants his hundred shares
back what you'll have to do is go buy
them from someone and then give them
back to Joe now let's deal with that a
little bit later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
