from the example that I just gave you
what page fault service is in order to
design a scalable operating system
service and a parallel operating system
we have to think about what is the right
recipe for every subsystem that you want
a design first determine functionally
what needs to be done for that service
now you've got parallel hardware and
therefore the functional part of that
service can be executed in parallel in
the different processors that are
available that's that's the easy part
but in order to ensure concurrent
execution of the service you have to
minimize the shared data structures only
if you minimize the shared data
structures will you really be able to
execute the functional part of that
service concurrently on the available
processes so less sharing will result in
more scalable implementation of the
service now the problem is it is easy to
say avoid sharing data structures but it
is hard to practice because it's always
not very clear how in designing the
subsystem we can limit the amount of
sharing of shared data structures now
coming back to the example of the page
fault service the page table data
structure that the operating system
maintains on behalf of the process it is
a logically shared data structure but if
we want true concurrency for updating
this data structure it is inappropriate
to have a single data structure that
represents the page table for a process
because if you have a single data
structure that represents the page table
for a process in order to do the
function of page fault service you have
to lock the data structure that leads to
a serial bottleneck but at the same time
if we say well you know let's take this
page table data structure and replicate
it on all the nodes of the
multiprocessor that probably is not also
a very good idea because then the
operating system has to worry about the
consistency of the shared data structure
copies that are existing on all the
processes and making them up-to-date all
the time and so on so you can now
quickly see what the dilemma is of the
operating system designer
so as an operating system designer we
want the freedom to think logically
about shared data structures but later
depending on the usage of the data
structure we want to replicate or
partition the data structure so that we
can have less flocking and more
concurrency that's the real trick the
trick is you want to think logically yes
it's a shared data structure but based
on the usage we want to replicate a
partition there's system data structures
so that you have more concurrency and
less locking for those shared data
structures so we will keep this recipe
and the principles we talked about in
mind and talk about one particular
service namely the memory management
subsystem and how we can avoid serial
bottlenecks using the techniques that is
proposed in one of the papers that I've
assigned to you for reading which is
called the tornado system the key
property is less sharing leads to more
scalable design</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
