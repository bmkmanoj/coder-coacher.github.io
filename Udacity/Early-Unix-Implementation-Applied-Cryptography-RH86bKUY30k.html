idea and this was actually what was done
by early versions of Unix so the idea
was to store for each user the result of
encrypting using the users password as
the key the value 0 so this means
there's no key to keep secret on the
server someone who compromises the
password file well they know that the
value being encrypted is 0 but we need
to test possible passwords to find the
one that matches and to make this harder
you wouldn't just run encryption once
you would run it many times if you
encrypt twice while this doubles the
work to check a password it also doubles
the attackers work for each password to
guess since the attacker has to guess
many more passwords than just the one
that was entered this scales the
attackers work more than it scales the
checking work and the way this worked in
UNIX it was doing this 25 times so the
value that was stored for each user was
the result of encrypting using the
password as the key using 0 as the
initial value but looping it around 25
times there are some problems with the
way this was done in early unix systems
the encryption function was des the data
encryption standard which used 56-bit
keys and the key was generated from the
password by just cutting it off take the
first 56 bits so with the 56 bit key the
first 56 bits of the user's password use
if this was encoded as 7-bit ascii that
was only eight letters it was actually a
little bit less than that because des
placed some restrictions on the key
structure so if user selected their
passwords using only the upper case
lower case and digits this corresponds
to 62 possibilities most users would not
pick uniformly from those 62 possible
characters but if they did there's 60 to
date possible passwords this is less
than 2 to the 48th for someone with
modern computing resources doing a
search on a space like this is very
feasible the reality is even worse than
this that a motivated attacker can
pre-compute a dictionary precompute this
value for a set of common words w store
the
pre computed values and then every new
password file that's compromised check
all the passwords against this list and
have a good likelihood of finding some
accounts that can be broken into so how
can we make dictionary attacks harder
well one idea would be at a train users
to pick better passwords users are
pretty hard to train this usually means
coerce instead force users to pick a
password that satisfy some properties it
could be a minimum length a mix of upper
and lower case letters and special
characters many websites do this it
usually just leads to annoyance and
doesn't necessarily lead to better
passwords you can certainly come up with
bad passwords that satisfy any set of
rules that someone forces you to use so
another solution would be to protect the
encrypted passwords to make sure that an
attacker or an insider can't get access
to them this would certainly help would
prevent the dictionary attack because
they wouldn't have access to the
encrypted passwords they could still try
a small number through the login
interface if the passwords are bad
enough well the dictionary attacker will
still succeed but only breaking a small
number of accounts the third approach is
to add salt this is the one I'll talk
about next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
