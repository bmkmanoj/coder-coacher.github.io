analysis you can check out the Wikipedia
definition from the instructor notes but
simply put it's an approach toward
understanding data using visualizations
and statistical tools think of EDA as
your initial interaction with data for
example let's say we want to look at a
set of cars this data comes from the
empty cars data set which comes with our
studio now we couldn't make any sort of
conclusions just by reading through the
table it'd be pretty difficult so
instead what we want to do is you want
to understand the distribution of the
variables for things like miles per
gallon cylinders and perhaps horsepower
we might create histograms which you'll
see later in lesson three this histogram
shows the distribution of weights for
all the cars or we might examine
correlations between variables like
miles per gallon and horsepower in that
case we want to create a scatterplot
we'll examine these in Lesson four our
second goal is to assess and validate
assumptions on which future inferences
will be based so we might ask questions
like which variables are normally
distributed or we might be wondering
whether or not a variable is biased
towards a particular value now this
might not be the case for our cars
dataset but certainly in other cases
like with social behavior or users
interacting on the web you might find
that third we want to understand the
data before forming intelligent
hypotheses well EDA can be the source of
an idea for an experiment it's not a
formal process of hypothesis testing and
predictive modeling ultimately we are
developing intuition about our dataset
and how it came into existence by
examining our data we can generate
better hypotheses determine which
variables have the most predictive power
and select appropriate statistical tools
to build our predictive models</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
