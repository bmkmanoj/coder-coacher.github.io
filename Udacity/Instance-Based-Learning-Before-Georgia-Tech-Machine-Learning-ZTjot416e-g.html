it's going pretty well
how's it going with you it is a
beautiful fall day here in Providence
Rhode Island oh that's right it's fall
when you are yeah I think that's right
so what we're going to do today Michael
if you will indulge me is we're going to
talk about a different class of learning
our rhythms and approaches than we've
been talking about before so now the
other ones were low class this is gonna
be high class exactly and we call them
instance based learning which sounds
very Hoodie 20 and highfalutin don't you
agree
yeah sure why not it sounds like it
maybe has good posture it does in fact
have good posture well let's let's learn
about it I'm intrigued yeah so I think
that a we're going to talking about
today is kind of interesting I hope and
but it's it's sort of different and what
I'm hoping is through this discussion is
that we will be able to reveal some of
the unspoken assumptions that we've been
making so far ok unspoken assumption as
it sounds yeah okay that sounds like we
should get to the bottom of that yes so
let's do that
so just to remind you of what we have
been doing in the past this is what was
going on with all of our little
supervised learning tasks right we were
given a bunch of training data labeled
here is you know XY 1 x y 2 x y 3 XY is
in and we would then learn some function
so for example if we have a bunch of
points in a plane we might learn a line
to represent them which is what this
little blue line is and what was
happening here is we take all this data
we come up with some function that
represents the data and then we would
throw the data away effectively right ok
yeah so like black is the input here and
then the two blue things are what gets
derived by the learning algorithm right
and then in the future when we get some
new data point let's call it X we would
pass it through this function whatever
it is this case probably line and that
would be how we would determine answers
going forward yeah that's that's what
we've been talking about right and in
particular without reference to the
original data so I want to propose an
alternative and the alternative is
basically going to be to not do this so
let me give you let me tell you exactly
what I mean by that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
