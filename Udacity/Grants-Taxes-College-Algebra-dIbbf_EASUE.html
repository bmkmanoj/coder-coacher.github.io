and grant with his new gleaming glasses
company is no exception the way that
taxes depend on income can be described
by functions but these are slightly
different functions than once you seen
before let's check them out first things
first here's a chart showing how a
person's yearly income determines the
amount of money they will pay the
government in taxes where grant lives we
can see that the tax rate over here or
the percent of their income that a
person will pay the government in taxes
changes depending on how high the
person's income is the way this works is
a little bit complicated so bear with me
here now someone makes under five
thousand dollars please note this entire
column is in dollars so if someone makes
under five thousand dollars there are
tax rate is zero percent so they
actually don't have to pay the
government anything at all if someone's
total incumbents between five thousand
dollars and fifteen thousand dollars the
first five thousand dollars that their
income is set aside and not text then
what is left over is taxed at this ten
percent rate if someone earns between
15,000 and thirty-five thousand dollars
total then as with the person in this
lower bracket the first five thousand
dollars of their income isn't taxed the
next ten thousand is taxed at ten
percent and then the rest is taxed at
twenty percent the person makes even
more money than this total then the
amount above thirty five thousand
dollars is taxed at thirty percent we
can think of this tax rate scaling as a
sort of layering effect as we're
counting up the money a person makes we
don't start by thinking about the total
we start by counting from zero once we
get to five thousand then we start to
add on tax rate and we keep counting up
and up increase in the right one we need
to</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
