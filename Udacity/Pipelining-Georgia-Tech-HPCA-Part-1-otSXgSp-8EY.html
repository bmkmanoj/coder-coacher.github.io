let's say we have discovered oil
somewhere very far away and we have a
gas station somewhere and now we take a
bucket of oil give it to somebody to
carry three days later they're here and
they pour the bucket of oil here and now
we have a quarter of a tank of oil so we
need to do this about four times it's
gonna take ten days probably for us to
have enough oil to feed a car so
completely the guy with the bucket
approach is not working well for us what
does work you have a long pipe and you
start pumping some oil into the pipe the
front part of the oil moves through the
pipe takes it several days to travel and
after three days we get a bucket of oil
here so what's the big deal the latency
is still three days the big deal is that
after we have filled the first bucket
three days after we sent the oil the
second bucket of oil comes right after
it so pretty much once we fill this
pipeline with oil we pump some oil here
and we keep pumping oil in and the oil
keeps coming out so the rate at which
oil is coming out is gonna be many
buckets per day although it takes three
days for the first bucket to get there
so the idea of pipelining really is that
although the latency is long for one
unit of oil to get there we can be
having many units of oil in progress so
that when one comes out we can very
quickly get the next one and the next
one and so on pretty much we are not
moving buckets one at a time there is
many many buckets traveling at the same
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
