automatic cause-effect chain isolating
the causes for different places during
the program execution for instance at
the beginning s had a value of double
quote and less than then C became a
double quote again a value found in the
failing run then quote became true and
then out became Lester which caused the
assertion to fail this cause-effect
chain is what you get when you apply
Delta debugging on state differences at
various places during the execution and
producing such a cause-effect chain
automatically is your homework this is a
very cool outcome but it's also a pretty
tricky homework in particular setting
variables while the program is executing
is a feature that's very rarely used
very rarely tested and therefore full of
surprises on the web page you will find
a number of hints and code templates
that help you in accomplishing this task
having such a cause-effect chain and
getting it automatically sounds like a
great promise for debugging in
particular because it very neatly tells
you the story of how the failure came to
be in particular the relationship of see
having a double quote and then the quote
variable becoming true points you
directly to the condition which is at
fault at this point you should coupe in
my oh sorry this is already the closest
to a fully automatic debugging tool we
can get at this point however it is
worth to very much consider the
limitations first and foremost you need
to similar runs the higher the
similarity the higher the chances of
finding a small set of philly inducing
differences even in our homework
implementation there's many things we
don't handle we'll only handle scalar
values and strings we won't go into
details of how to find differences
between say lists or dictionaries or
graph structures and finally all of this
is still very experimental but the fact
that it's experimental call so many ways
to extend
this and this again can be part of your
homework again on the web page you will
find a number of ways of how to further
expand this so go and build fully
automatic debugging for Python programs
