direct access to the hardware hardware
we said we're going to trust that's not
something we're going to although you
may have reasons to to be suspicious the
hardware itself but we're not going to
go there so we're basically talking
about how can we trust software the
software is supposed to perform a set of
functions we been discussing some of
those weather recently access control or
kind of policies that are supported and
so on so if it's going to implement
certain functionality it has to be
functionally correct okay when it says
it implements a certain model it
implements that model correctly the
functional correctness basically means
that it does what it was designed to do
so implements a set of functions and and
that is done correctly now to implement
those functions it does have data
structures so data state that makes use
of also it may be protecting other data
that belongs to different users and
programs and things like that if it's
trusted software we wanted to implement
the functions it's supposed to do
correctly as well as maintain the
integrity of the data that it is going
to rely on and we want it to maintain
that integrity even in the presence of
bad input so we do expose some interface
or API hensley bad guys can try to use
it in ways that we didn't expect it to
be used give it bad input for example so
the integrity that should be maintained
by the trusted computing base actually
is is maintained in the presence of a
threat model where an adversary may even
try to provide bad inputs obviously
there is sensitive data that it uses and
it protects for other users and
applications it has to address the
confidentiality or disclosure of this
sensitive data it shouldn't be disclosed
to somebody who doesn't have access to
it and it should do that in the presence
of an untrusted software obviously we're
not going to assume that all software is
is going to be trusted okay so we have
our trusted computing base and then
untrusted software that is run by
applications on so this disclosure that
we want to control for sensitive data
can make assumption that all code in the
system is trusted so the last couple of
sort of requirements we
identified in terms of integrity
confidentiality implementing the
necessary functions really talk about
what it does our confidence basically
says how well does it do that okay
confidence we can sort of demand a proof
that's going to be really hard a formal
proof but you know as we said earlier
there could be things that increase our
confidence in the system's ability to do
all these things that we're talking
about so where does this confidence come
from well a lot of things in real life
it could come from the fact that they're
experts at this kind of stuff and
evaluating this kind of a system and
maybe they analyze it they spend time
with it and it's their word based on
which we actually derive our confidence
and the trust that is assured by the
system finally we can sort of think
about this as sort of our requirements
or needs in terms of trustworthiness can
be may be captured in a statement and
that statement says well this is the
kind of security or trust we expect the
system to provide this is what we expect
the system to enforce and then the
system someone who builds the system
design and build the system so let's say
there's a vendor who provides the system
we said PCB functionality normally
operating system is where it goes in
typical systems that we have so an OS
vendor for example may have to then tell
us that our requirements are met we come
up with in some sort of a requirements
analysis or a statement that sort of
captures our expectation and then
somebody has to give us a checklist or a
proof of some kind at sort of meats
allows us to believe that our
expectations are met and so the best
possible scenario is that all this could
be done formerly okay we actually have a
proof that the whoever is providing the
trusted computing base actually you know
meets our requirements our expectations
that we capture in the statement when we
have set a formal proof of it that would
be ideal but would it be possible always
this is one of the questions we're going
to explore as we go through this lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
