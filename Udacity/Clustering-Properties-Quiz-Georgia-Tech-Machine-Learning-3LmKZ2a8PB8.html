properties quiz oh yeah
alright so what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna give you three different
clustering algorithms for each one ask
whether it has these properties does it
have richness
does it have scale invariance does it
have consistency and so the algorithms
are all going to be variations of the
first clustering algorithm we talked
about single link clustering and so what
we're gonna do is we're gonna run single
link clustering but to make it a
clustering algorithm we have to decide
under what conditions are we going to
stop building our clusters and I've got
three different conditions then that
defines our three different algorithms
so one is we've got n items that we're
clustering I'm gonna stop when I've got
n over two clusters okay so just keep
merging keep building clusters until
you've reached in over two clusters and
at that point stop and return what
you've got okay
that make sense yes all right and you
remember enough about single in
clustering for that to be meaningful but
that's it's where we're gonna start off
with everything in its own cluster and
then merge them together by whatever two
clusters are closest together and then
iterate yes okay all right so that's
algorithm one we're gonna stop it in
over two clusters the second one is
we're gonna have some parameter theta
and we're gonna keep merging clusters
until we'd have to merge clusters that
are theta units apart and once they are
theta units apart we're gonna say nope
that's too far to be part of the same
cluster we're done okay
okay so that again it's a clustering
algorithm area it's going to take these
distances and it's going to turn it into
groups so that's like only things that
are within ten feet of each other could
possibly be clustered exactly right
theta is going to define that and the
last one is very very similar we're
gonna keep doing clusters until we'd
have two merged clusters that are
farther than theta over Omega units
apart and Omega in this case is going to
be defined to be the largest pairwise
distance over the entire dataset that's
an Omega yes okay and that's a capital D
at least now it is okay all right good
so if you understand these algorithms
what I'd like you to do is say which of
these have the richest property which of
them have scale invariance which of them
have consistency</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
