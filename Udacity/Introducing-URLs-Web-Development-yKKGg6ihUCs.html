seen URLs before URL stands for Uniform
Resource locator an example URL would be
as follows
this is an example URL it's got three
main parts it's got the protocol
separated by a colon and two slashes
from the host which precedes the path
and in this case the path is just the
slash and if we didn't have that slash
there the path would still be a slash
because that's the minimum path now the
protocol can be a number of things but
for our purposes it's going to be HTTP
almost all the time we'll also see HTTPS
from time to time and you'll see how the
protocols around the web you might see
FTP or you know things things like that
but HTTP basically means you know the
web that's that's what we're going to be
learning in this class the host this is
the host name or domain name of the of
the server that has the document we want
to access this can also be an IP address
the source just of course translates
into an IP address and this is the you
know the description of the location of
the physical machine that has the
document we want the fetch and the path
is the document we're going to fetch now
the path can be more complicated so the
path would be this whole thing if we
were accessing the image we were using
in the previous part of the lecture</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
