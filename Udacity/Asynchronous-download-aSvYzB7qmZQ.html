at our previous code once we factor now
it looks much better and most important
of all it won't crash if we provide a
badly formatted URL and nsurl returns
Anil however even though it does look
good it still sucks it blocks the main
queue so we're going to fix this first
of all we need to find the line that is
blocking can you spot it just by looking
at the code yep it's this one the NS
data one that's the one that downloads
the huge image and stuff it into an NS
data we need to send this fellow to
background q actually the next line
where we convert this NS data into a
uiimage might also take some time
although much less so let's send both to
the background but hold on uiimage
belongs to you I kit so we should never
use it in the main queue well no not
really not all of you I kid is thread
unsafe there are a few exceptions such
as UI image however all the visual stuff
the views are unsafe so changing the
image property here that must be done in
the main queue always remember the
famous haiku from zen master bushell if
the name ends in view it belongs and the
main queue first of all let's create a
cue from scratch so the first step is to
create the URL now that we have the URL
we need to create a cue from scratch to
create a cue from scratch we use the
function dispatch q create and it takes
two parameters the first one is just a
name you can put there whatever you want
doesn't really matter and the second one
tells GCD what kind of cue you want nil
in this case tells GCD that we want a
synchronous or its serial q otherwise
you would have to use a different
constant that you can check on the
documentation to create an asynchronous
queue but we're not going to use those
in this course the following step is to
call dispatch async it will take two
parameters the queue in this case
download and the closure all
notice that here i'm using the trailing
closure syntax so in here is where we
need to download the NS data turn it
into a UA image and then display let's
get started once we have the cube we can
call dispatch async and send encapsulate
in a closure the offending code and send
it to the background however we have a
problem here we're downloading the image
in the background q we're turning it
into a uiimage also in the background q
but we need to run this code and display
this image in the main queue how could
we do this how can we hop from a
background queue to the main queue well
I've been hinting it for some time you
gotta think of inception with dreams
within dreams in this case it's closures
with enclosures so from within the
background closure in here we're going
to get a reference to the main queue and
then call dispatch async within
disclosure and send another closure to
the main queue so basically we're going
to start here in the background and once
we reach this point we're going to jump
to the main queue let's see how we can
do this let's take a look at this code
again so first of all we jump to the
background run a few lines of code that
will block and once we're done with this
we jump to the main queue using the same
function dispatch async but this time
we're providing the main queue with
dispatch get main queue and within
disclosure that will run in the main
queue we set the image for the image
view so this way we make sure that all
of the code that updates the UI runs in
the maiden q so this is not only
efficient it's absolutely safe and this
is the true beauty of grand central
dispatch it makes asynchronous code look
like it's cereal which is easier to
understand one line after the other
while you're actually
hopping from one cue to the other q
before we move on let's make sure that
this code actually does not block let's
run it and take a look so let's try
again the synchronous it blocks okay and
let's try the asynchronous see that it
just kind of blips and that's it so even
though it seems like it's instantaneous
it's actually downloading the image in
the background so let's get here and
once we click here it just blinks and we
can while it's downloading you can use
the UI so so far looks good let's move
to the next step and implement this less
method this is kind of your graduation
for this lesson it's an asynchronous
method with a completion closure let's
give it a try</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
