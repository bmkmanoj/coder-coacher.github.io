where do the methods come from one
obvious source is the operations in our
analysis model in addition to the
specific services provided there are
signals okay and there may be actions
activities and events in any behavior
models such as state charts we also have
to make sure that we're assigning those
operations in the form of methods to
particular classes in addition to those
that come directly from the analysis
model there's others we should always be
aware might need to be included in our
classes these include constructors and
destructors getters and setters copy
constructors printers or methods that
construct string versions of the data
inside of a class selectors if you have
complex data how you're going to take
out the pieces of it and any kind of
iterators if you have if your class has
more than one you know is a collection
class of some sort how are you going to
provide the elements of that collection
it's not necessarily the case that every
class has to have all of these methods
but you should be aware of the
possibility of their existence so you
can determine early on whether or not
that you need to define them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
