overlay Network
let me explain what an overlay network
is in the previous example I said my
node ID is ad and the content
corresponding to the key 149 is stored
at my node ID 80 and this is something
that you've discovered and once you've
discovered it you want to come to me to
get the content from me but how will you
do that
what does 80 mean from the point of view
of the Internet as you know the physical
infrastructure of the internet works
with IP addresses but what you have is
80 it's not an IP address and the
operating system only understands IP
addresses to route packets on the
internet from source to destination so
we need at the user level because we are
doing this sharing of content at the
user level a way of mapping such virtual
addresses 80 60 and so on to IP
addresses so we as friends who have
decided that well we want to form a
social network to share information
content and so forth we've exchanged
such mapping information and constructed
a routing table at the user level and
this is what is called an overlay
network a virtual network on top of the
physical network so for example if you
using that sha-1 hash found that your IP
address maps to node ID 60 you'll say
okay sure my node ID is 60 and my IP
address is such and so so that is how
I'm going to construct a user level
routing table all I know is your node ID
and that node ID maps to some IP address
and I can use this correspondence
between the node ID and the IP address
to have a way of sending information to
you and maybe a friend of yours has
exchanged routing information with you
and he has told you that his node ID is
80 and he has also given you how to
region given that node ID
and you've shared that information with
me as well saying that you know I have
buddies and these are all the node IDs
of my buddies so that's how I construct
this routing table which is really a
table that consists of load IDs of my
friends and friends of friends friends
of friends of friends and so on
that's how I construct this user level
routing table now if I wanted to send a
message to my buddy let's say B and his
node ID is 60 because B has given me his
IP address when I send a message to node
ID I can convert that to the IP address
give it to the physical network and it
goes to the physical network gets
delivered to be what if I want to send a
message to some other node see I know
the node idea of C because my buddy be
exchanged that with me but I have no
idea what the IP address of C is but on
the other hand I do know that B has a
way of getting to C and so in my routing
table what I'm going to say is that
given a name of a particular node I know
the virtualized node ID associated with
that node 64 be 84 C and I also know
what the next hop is in the user space
in the virtual space of getting to that
particular destination in the case of B
I know I can directly send it to 60
because I have an IP address for B on
the other hand if I want to send it to
see I have the node ID ad of C but I
have no idea what that map's to in terms
of IP address I know that my buddy B has
a way of getting it to C and that's what
I'm gonna use I'm gonna say if I want to
send something to see
I simply hand it over to my buddy who is
at node ID 60 so the routing table says
given a node ID who's the next hop I
should give it to so that it'll
eventually get there now the physical
network of course is much more elaborate
than this user level overlay Network now
for instance let's say I want to send a
message to see his node ID is a D but I
have no idea how to send it to him
except to know that if I give it to my
buddy
who's at node ID 60 he'll know how to
get it over to to see so I'm gonna send
it to be and when it comes to be be
knows from his routing table the IP
address for C and therefore he will send
it to C and it'll eventually teach C so
at the user level you can see that so
far as I'm concerned if my node ID is 50
and my node name is a when I wanted to
send the message to see what I did was
to send it to be and it took two hops at
the user level it took two hops to go
from A to C went to be my buddy and B
then sent it over to C so this is a user
level traversal of the message but in
reality under the covers what is going
on is when I send this message from A to
B it is going through the physical
network and reaching B and when I send
the message to ADC even though it is two
hops over here internally in terms of
the number of network hops that may have
to be incurred in the physical network
for the message to reach eventually the
destination C it might take many more
hops that's what an overlay network is a
virtual network on top of the physical
network and this particular overlay is a
content distribution network because it
allows content to be shared and
distributed among a set of users who
have exchanged information with one
another so that they can discover one
another if not directly indirectly
through friends of friends</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
