answer is three it sometimes would be
left and sometimes would be right
depending upon where you randomly start
so for example if you start with your
random centers on a and B then I think
what will happen is d will end up on the
right as that point gets dragged over
towards the weight of the right it'll
drag d with it if you started out with
both points on F and G then I think he
would get dragged to the left cluster as
the leftmost cluster got dragged to the
left I think if you started it with a
and G then it would depend upon how you
break ties and since I always break ties
LexA graphically because I like saying
the word LexA graphically it would end
up on the left so I think the answer has
to be the third choice but I'll say one
thing I wish it were the fourth choice I
would like to grant this wish by talking
about the next clustering algorithm
which in particular does soft clustering
and soft clustering allows for the
possibility that a point can be shared
you know a little bit of this humble
over to that I'm a little bit of country
I'm a little bit of rock and roll</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
