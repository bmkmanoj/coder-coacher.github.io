California which is very close to San
Francisco San Francisco is notorious for
its hills and the difficulty of parking
when you pull up to a spot in San
Francisco you have to pull your
emergency brake and that locks the tires
and prevents them from rotating the
force that keeps you from sliding down
the hill though is actually what's
called the force of friction and that
exists between the tires and the road I
didn't draw the arrow coming from down
there but that's really where the force
exists now obviously friction can only
do so much obviously if you park your
car on a hill that's completely vertical
well you're in trouble
friction is not going to provide enough
force to prevent you from falling down
the hill on the other hand if you park
on a pretty jindal Hill you should be
fine I want to know what's the angle
where your car is going to slip there
must be one let's figure out what it is
so let's say for your tires and this
road surface the force of friction has a
maximum value of 80% of the cars weight
I want to know what is the steepest
angle hill and this is what angle I'm
talking about here that you can safely
park on so if the hill got any steeper
you're in trouble and the car falls down
enter your answer here in degrees if
you're not sure what to do go back to
the previous lesson learn some more
about inclined planes and if you're
still confused go to the forums I
understand this quite a tricky question</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
