matrix multiply but I can't say enough
what an important computational
primitive it is to study now I say that
not only because I think it has
important applications it's also because
you can use it to see a lot of different
analysis techniques for instance in this
lesson you saw different algorithmic
approaches like 1d versus 2d versus 3d
distributions as well as a way to argue
about communication lower bounds it
won't always be easy to do those sorts
of analyses on other algorithms but I
hope you'll try another reason to think
about matrix multiply is that for better
or for worse the machines we build today
if your wee bit cynical like me are
tuned for it for instance you should
have noticed something when the problem
is big enough there's a lot more work
than communication that means matrix
multiply ought to scale well as systems
and problems get bigger it's in that
sense that things like the top 500 list
which measure peak capability might not
translate to more communication
intensive applications now speaking of
big and I admit this fact is a bit of a
non sequitur did you know that a Rubik's
Cube has 43 quintillion 252 quadrillion
three trillion 274 billion 489 million
eight hundred and fifty six thousand
possible configurations try telling
people that fact at your next cocktail
party and I'm sure you'll be a really
big hit just like me because I'm a huge
hit at cocktail parties with my numbers
and like constants out to ten digits and
stuff pretty cool</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
