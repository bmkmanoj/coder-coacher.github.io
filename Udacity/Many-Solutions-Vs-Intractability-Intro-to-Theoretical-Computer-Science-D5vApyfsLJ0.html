make one important point and I don't
know if this already occurred to you but
at least you might be inclined to think
that it's rather obvious that the
problem that Alice Bob and Carol are
working on is intractable for one simple
reason each of their problems has to
look at an exponential number of
solutions so for vertex cover we have oh
of two to the power of n potential
solutions that we have to look at
because there are two to the power of n
0 1 assignments to the vertices for
putting the vertices of a graph into a
vertex cover and the same thing is true
for independent set and clique as we
have seen in the last unit now the
question is that's the fact that there
is an exponential number of solutions
already mean that the problem must be
intractable you could basically think
this because having to consider an
exponential number of solutions might
mean that you have to look at each one
of those solutions and that obviously is
going to take exponential time what I
now want to show you is that this is not
the correct intuition to have so having
many solutions does not mean that a
problem is intractable it can mean this
but it doesn't have to
and to show you this I'm going to give
you one example where we have an
exponential number of solutions but
actually there's a polynomial time
algorithm for our problem
so what I would like you to tell me in
this graph here how many different paths
or how many different ways there are of
getting from A to B if you cannot go
backwards so you start out at a and once
you've traveled across an edge you
cannot go backwards you always have to
go forward so how many ways are there to
get from A to B and of course this is a
very simple warm up example and I'm
going to draw a little arrows here just
to make clear that we cannot go
backwards</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
