world differential equation the second
derivative of the position vector of the
spacecraft which is its acceleration
vector equals the gravitational constant
times the mass of the Earth times a
vector that points from the spacecraft
to the earth / the third power of its
length this boils down to the third
power of the distance between the
spacecraft and earth now comes the
component due to the moon gravitational
constant times the mass of the moon
times vector from the spacecraft to the
moon / the third power of its length
this is a differential equation an
equation that governs or is governed by
rates of change the acceleration vector
is the rate of change of a rate of
change this actually is a system of
differential equations it's not a single
equation we've got two components in
here each of these two components has to
fulfill this equation the highest
derivative that occurs is the second one
which is why we call this differential
equation a differential equation of
order to the highest derivative stands
alone on one side and does not occur
anywhere else this is what we call
explicit if the highest derivative was
hidden somewhere we would first need to
solve that equation which is ugly and
these two terms mean that this
differential equation is nonlinear a
linear differential equation would only
contain terms such as 42 x XS or sine of
T times XS</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
