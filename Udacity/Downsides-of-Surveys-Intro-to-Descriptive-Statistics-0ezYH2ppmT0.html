can't always be sure that respondents
are answering truthfully even if surveys
are anonymous people don't always give
the truth for some reason it's probably
a psychological thing and often times
without realizing it we give biased
answers everyone has their own bias
based on where they grew up the
experiences that they went through their
beliefs and values when respondents
don't understand the questions we get
what's called response bias that's why
it's very important for those who write
the survey to be very precise in their
wording and finally some people just
refuse to answer they don't feel
comfortable answering that or they're
incapable of doing so there might be a
certain group of people who don't answer
the questions and therefore the data
that we get from this survey doesn't
accurately represent them when certain
people refused to answer this is called
non-response bias remember when we
talked about constructs surveys are
often used to analyze constructs and
like I told you I analyzed the construct
effort as you've seen there isn't just
one definition of a construct
there are many therefore it's crucial to
use as subjective measurements as
possible
surveys really have to be carefully
thought out and worded</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
