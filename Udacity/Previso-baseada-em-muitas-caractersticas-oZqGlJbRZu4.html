this point is try to predict which
students are likely to pass their first
project and which students aren't you
could take a first pass of this using
some heuristics based on your
exploration for example you could
predict that students who spend more
time in the classroom during their first
week are more likely to eventually pass
the first project however getting a
really good prediction this way could be
difficult for one thing there are lots
of different pieces of information that
we probably should be looking at you'd
probably at least want to look at the
things I looked at earlier lessons
completed minutes spent and days visited
but there could be a lot more pieces of
information or features that you'd like
to look at its well this wouldn't be so
bad except that all of your different
features can have complex interactions
with each other for example when you
look at minutes spent in the classroom
on its own it might look like a really
important feature but then when you look
at lessons completed and minutes spent
together you might see that after you
already know how many lessons the
student completed knowing how many
minutes they spent doesn't give you any
additional information in many
situations like this one you can use
machine learning to make pretty good
predictions automatically usually a lot
better than the predictions you could
make my hand depending on the machine
learning algorithm you use it might also
give you a ranked list of which features
were most important to the prediction
which can be very interesting if you'd
like to learn more about this you might
want to take our introduction to machine
learning course linked in the instructor
