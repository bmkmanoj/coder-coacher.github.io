about implementing generalization you
certainly want to be able to take
advantage of whatever inheritance
features in your programming language
you just need to stick to certain rules
typically this means that in children
classes you can add features but you
don't want to take away features and you
want to really restrict how you do any
kind of overriding in the child class
when you do want to override a method in
the child class make sure that you obey
that two following rules first of all
when calling that particular method you
want to make sure that the child method
can accept any arguments that the parent
method could accept that is the child
has to be as open to inputs as the
parent does secondly the output produced
by the child method when given the same
arguments that were given to the pair
method should produce the same result
what we're saying with both these rules
is that for the same situation in the
parent the child needs to do the same
thing it needs to be a special case now
the child can do more if the child is
handling a special case of the parent it
can deal with that particular special
case it just has to always act as if it
is it is also obeying whatever rules is
specified for the parent</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
