so here we have the the head contour
another kind of model is suppose you've
got some way of detecting colored blobs
that represents a hands and hit now your
state would might be the XY location of
the hands and head and your measurement
might be where you think the colored
blobs are and your sensor model might be
how well the predicted blobs match the
color you can use sort of any model you
want as long as you can have a state and
you can talk about how that state
expresses itself in fact here's an even
better model suppose you want to track
some region of a distribution of colors
right so like maybe this region here or
this region here where you can see the
lip so that kind of gives away that the
region that we're gonna we're gonna be
tracking here what would be a good model
or state for tracking that okay well
clearly you want the location is after
all I want to know where the thing is
alright and if I've defined a region I
want to know sort of how that region is
changing maybe a little bit orientation
or size but just to tell me this the
position and size that's not enough I
need something about the appearance in
this particular method and we're going
to talk a lot more about this next time
what they tracked is really cool they
track the distribution of colors right
so if I look over let's say I won't do
that ree time to do this region over
here right there's some white pixels
there are some reddish pixels there are
some brownish pixels and as that player
moves the shape will change into form
etc but the overall distribution of
colors might be quite similar all right
and in fact what you have to say is well
what's a reasonable sensor model and
we're going to get to that next time but
basically what you're going to do is
you're going to compute the similarity
of the color distribution of what you
had and the color distribution of your
proposed state all right and you'll need
somewhere of comparing those color
distributions and just as a way of
showing you how well this thing works
this here's two examples this is
actually done using mean shift filtering
but could
also been done using particle filtering
and we'll talk about that both next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
