memories available in the clients for
cooperatively cashing the files and
reducing the stress on the management of
data files an X of S as opposed to the
traditional UNIX file system they also
worry about the coherence of files I
mentioned earlier that in UNIX file
system the file server assumes that it
is serving each client independently and
therefore it doesn't worry about sharing
of files if a particular file happens to
be accessed by multiple users at the
same time the server doesn't worry about
the coherence of that file but on the
other hand in XFS the file system what
is about cache coherence and I've
already introduced the idea of cache
coherence in the context of
multiprocessors and distributed shared
memory so you're familiar with the
terminology single rider multiple
readers meaning that a particular file
may have at any point of time only a
single writer they cannot be multiple
riders to the same file but it can have
multiple readers at the same time and
the unit of cache coherence that XFS
maintains is at the level of file blocks
not an entire file but at the level of
individual file blocks so if you look at
a manager for a file the guy that is
responsible for the metadata management
for the file it has information about
the files for which it is the manager
let's say it has a file f one for which
it has a man it is the manager then the
metadata in the memory of this manager
will have information about the current
state of that file for instance this
particular entry says that a file f1
managed by this manager is being read
concurrently but two different clients
c1 and c2 so there are two different
clients c1 and c2 and they have copies
of this file that they have retrieved
from this manager at some point of time
which means that the client caches c1
and c2 contain the contents of this file
now for simplicity I'm sure
doing this as a file but in fact the
granularity at which the coherence and
information about filed is kept is at a
file block level so at a block level the
manager says a particular block of a
file is in the cache of client c1 and in
the cache of client c2 and here I'm
using the word cash to mean that it is
in the memory of these clients so the
semantics that is observed for cache
coherence a single writer multiple
readers so if clients III makes a
request to the manager for writing to
this file f1 and again I have to mention
that the request is going to be at the
granularity of a file block but for
simplicity I'm showing it as a write
request for this file f1 but you
understand that the granularity at which
this request is being made is for
writing a particular block of that file
so the manager gets this right to
request it looks up the metadata for
that particular file and it sees that
this file is now currently read shared
by two different clients c1 and c2 this
guy wants to write to the file that
results in a conflict at read/write
conflict and what the manager is going
to do is basically say well if somebody
wants to write to that file I have to
tell the guys that currently have the
file they cannot have it anymore so just
as in the case of cache coherence in a
multiprocessor this manager is going to
send an invalidation message for the
file f1 to c 1 and 2 C 2 and they're
going to acknowledge to the manager
saying that yes we have invalidated our
local copies of the files and once the
manager gets that indication back from
the clients at that point the manager
can tell the client c3 that okay now
you've got dibs on writing to this file
that's the protocol that is being
observed in XFS to keep the copies of
the files consistent so at the end of
this exchange c3 will have the right to
write to this particular file now how
long does
have that privilege well the right
request when it is granted the client
gets a token and the manager at any
point of time can revoke the token that
is given to c3 and this in particular
will happen when a future read for the
same file comes to the manager at that
point the manager will go to c3 and say
I'm voguing the token from you you
cannot write to that file anymore you
can read it because the request that I
got is only a read request and therefore
you can keep the file but you cannot
write to it anymore if you want to write
it again then you have to make a request
again this is the protocol that is
observed and of course if a particular
client is writing to a file and another
client also wants to write to the same
file at that point the manager once
again is going to revoke the token
invalidate the file at this client pull
back the contents of the file and then
distribute it to a future requester who
wants to write to the same file that's
how cache coherence works and using the
fact that copies of the file is existing
in multiple clients exif s exploits that
fact to do cooperative caching what that
means is that if a client is currently
having a copy of the file let's say
after this interchange c3 has a copy of
the file that is also writing to a
future read request comes when it comes
that read requests can be satisfied by
getting the contents of the file from
the cache of c3 and that is what
cooperative caching is all about where
instead of going to the disk to retrieve
the file we can actually get the file
content from the cache of one of the
clients that happens to have a copy of
the file</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
