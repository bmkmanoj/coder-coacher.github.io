perspective viewport awesomeness that is
the rest of this lesson let's learn one
more shape the shape renderer can make
for us circles also partial circles or
arcs we're going to explore some more
code in the course repository you can
load up this project yourself and follow
along to dig in let's check out the to
do's here's the most basic circle you
can draw specifying the x position of
the center the y position of the center
and the radius of the circle and there
we go it's beautiful right we can also
draw a partial circle or an arc by
specifying the number of degrees
counterclockwise from the positive
x-axis that the arc should start and how
many more degrees it should keep going
from that point so this line is 45
degrees from the positive x-axis in the
counterclockwise direction and then 270
degrees is three-quarters of a circle so
we get this pac-man shape circles have a
dirty little secret though they're not
really circles they're a fan of
triangles where all their triangles have
their points at the center of the circle
shape renderer will pick how many
triangles to use so the circle looks
smooth but if you make super small
circles it might choose to use too few
this optional last parameter sets the
number of segments to use let's see what
happens when we set the segment count
too low if we set the segment count too
low we end up with a circle that looks
like a stop sign this can also happen if
you're drawing very small circles but
you're zoomed way in on them circles can
be drawn using either shape type filled
or shape type line the latter draws just
the outline of the circle if we want to
draw both solid circles and the outlines
of circles in the same render call back
we first need to end our filled batch
and begin a new batch and line mode
let's give this a try there we go a
circle drawn in line mode is just the
outline of the circle let's try
something crazy and draw some target
rings BAM there we go we can also draw
just the outline of an arc just like so
and if we draw the outlines of a bunch
of Arc's stacked up on top of each other
we can draw some funky snail shell like
thing remember if any of this seemed too
complicated or went too fast don't just
take my word for it you've got all this
code
sitting on your computer so check it out
and play with it yourself</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
