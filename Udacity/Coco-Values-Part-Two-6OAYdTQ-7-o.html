but i want to say if we were in this
situation what would we what would we
actually do I mean if it really is kind
of you know if we're doing don't boost
reach for example what would you do to
encourage me to maybe participate in the
other Nash equilibrium um I guess I
would just state that's what we're going
to do and you have no reason not to do
it yeah but I'd be like now I have no
reason to do it either this is true but
since all the utilities are inside the
matrix might as well just do it I might
as well not to it we gotta do something
well I'm gonna don't boost to why
they're both the same they're both 0
okay I don't you wanna make me I want
I'm ha you have that's not game theory
me making you happy is not game theory
game theory is about utilities so is
there anything that you could do to
change the utility for me oh sure I
could offer you a banana aha share yes
and so the essence of what happens in
cocoa values is that we're going to talk
about making side payments so the punch
line is going to be we're going to we're
going to do this thing that actually
benefits the US mutually like the sum of
the payoffs is maximal and then we're
going to dispense the the spoils right
we're gonna we're going to get as many
been out as we can and then give them
out in a way that's fair sort of I mean
a priori it might not be so obvious what
would be fair like maybe i would say i'd
hold out for no i'm not going to give
you a boost unless you give me three of
the bananas you can keep just one but
it's going to turn out in this
particular case that that one banana
payment actually is justifiable that's
cool because that's what I was thinking
I was thinking yeah look man I'll give
you one banana now what if what if this
was 40 would you still feel like one
banana would suffice for me yeah but for
me to add to actually give you a boost
um I guess you would expect more maybe
more yeah so I mean I don't know that I
really thought this through but if when
the number was for like look I mean I
can get to if I wanna so really this is
about why don't we split the extra
benefit yeah nice nice okay and that's
that is a really powerful intuition for
understanding how these things go okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
