is what we refer to as active 3d sensing
where somehow you're projecting
something out into the environment or
sending some energy into the environment
and reading that energy back in order to
recover depth so we actually talked up
just a little bit about photometric
stereo when we talked about a photometry
and the idea that you could recover
shape if you had known light sources so
even though these are thought of as
regular images your it's actually an
active sensing technique because you're
lighting the system in a controlled way
that you know about but when most people
talk about active sensing they talk
about something that creates sort of
special signals or pictures so an
obvious one is just bounce something off
a surface and wait to see how long it
takes to get back all right so there are
different methods of doing that this is
a little guy he has these little
ultrasonic sensors okay if you go way
back in time back in the Wayback Machine
I don't know if is the 70s or 80s the
Polaroid cameras started doing active
sensing they actually had a little
acoustic sonar chip on them that would
send out what's called a chirp and then
based upon how long the response got how
long the response took it new based upon
the speed of sound how far away the
thing was and it would focus the camera
one of the interesting effects of that
is because they made so many of those
cameras it made those sonar things very
cheap so people started putting them all
over robots and things like that and
using sonar to detect depth much more
sophisticated is what's called lidar or
a laser rangefinder there's two of them
here one is on the side over here one is
stuck in here these are on a PR to robot
these actually generate a slice and they
send a little beam out and they wait to
see how long it comes back now of course
that's a lot faster than was sound okay
but it's measurable but you only get a
slice of depth so then what you actually
do is you put it on a little device that
goes up and down like that and so this
little front area actually sweeps that
plane and it produces a 3d depth image
that way so that's these are referred to
as time-of-flight sensors</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
