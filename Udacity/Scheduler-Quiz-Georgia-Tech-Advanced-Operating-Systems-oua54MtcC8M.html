you how should the scheduler choose the
next thread to run on the CPU i'm going
to give you four different choices the
first is first come first that is if i
have a bunch of threads the scheduler
says well which was the earliest one
that was ready to run on the processor
that's going to be the one that I'm
going to schedule that is first come
first served the second possibility is
it's going to assign static priority to
all the threads so it's going to pick
the thread that has the highest static
priority to run on the processor the
third possibility is that the priority
is not static but it is dynamic or in
other words it changes over time and so
what the schedule is going to do is pick
the one that has the highest dynamic
priority and the fourth choice is it's
going to pick a thread whose memory
contents are likely to be in the cache
of the CPU so these are the four choices
and I want you to think about it and
come up with some thoughts as to what
might be the right thing that the
scheduler might do in picking the next
processor to run</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
