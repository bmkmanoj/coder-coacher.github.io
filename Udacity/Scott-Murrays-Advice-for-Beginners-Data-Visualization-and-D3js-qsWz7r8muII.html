who may not have a lot of programming
experience well on one hand it is an
awesome time to be doing that because
the fields kind of exploding right now
there's sort of the whole data movement
big data like everybody's talking about
data and at the same time you know
they're just as many people trying to
make sense of all that data and visually
represent it so in terms of advice it's
it's really hard to give a general
advice because you know the the good
news and the bad news is there's so many
different ways into this field if
somebody is like a student wanting to go
to school looking at programs you know
their programs like this Udacity Program
there aren't a ton of sort of you know
majors or even graduate programs yet in
information visualization so there's no
kind of obvious one place to get all the
skills that you need and and what I
think is exciting about the field is
people come into it from so many
different areas like I you know you know
architects industrial designers graphic
designers statisticians mathematicians
like everybody has some sort of core
prior backgrounds and they bring that
with them to the field so what you know
one thing I encourage people to do is
take advantage of whatever your personal
background is and like bring that to the
field and see what you can do with it
now I'm like a more practical level
usually people want to know well what
books should every year what program
should I learn or how do I you know and
again if that depends like I work with
students who are coming from a design
background and so for them it doesn't
make sense to dive into like the most
technical code heavy projects it makes
sense to build on what they already know
so for somebody with a design background
I would say you start with with
illustrator start doing things manually
and like figuring out ways to connect
the things you know how to do to data
somebody who's coming from computer
science mathematics something like that
obviously you can leverage you know your
skills being able to use some of these
more advanced tools but you might have
to learn
like the design language and the visual
principles and looking at human
perception and psychology and like how
do we interpret colors and scale and
size and proportion and all this stuff
so unfortunately the answer is always
sort of it depends and it's gonna be a
little bit different for everyone and I
think that's okay it's actually what's
kind of exciting about the field is
everybody has their own perspective
