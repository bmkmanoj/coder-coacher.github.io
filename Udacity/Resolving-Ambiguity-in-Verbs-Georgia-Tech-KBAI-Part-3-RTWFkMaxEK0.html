sentences in a story can be ambiguous
for example by could have referred to an
agent conveyance or a location this is
to not just a propositions which is also
true of other work lexical categories
like burbs in fact verbs often can have
several interpretations let us consider
the verb take as an example take is a
very common verb it has at least these
12 different meanings consider for
instance to medicate a shock took an
aspirin here the meaning is that are
shocked esperan as a medication each of
these meanings is the common meaning of
take as we will see in just a minute but
given a sentence in which take occurs
how do we know which of these meanings
is intended by the word take so suppose
the input sentence was my doctor took my
blood pressure that taken the sentence
refers to to measure and not do any of
the others that is examine this issue
further so for each of these 12
interpretations of take we have a frame
like representation so take one to take
12 each of this frame like
representation specifies the thematic
roles that go with that particular
meaning of take so in this particular
meaning of take take one we have an
agent and an object in this meaning of
take take 12 we have an agent and
article and particle another word that
typically occurs with cake which
signifies this meaning so to take off
clothes from a body let us consider
another example of particle let us
consider take 11 the meaning of this
takers to assume control as in to assume
control of a company or to assume
control of a country when the meaning is
intended to be to assume control then
take typically occurs with the word over
take over company take over a country so
over then is a particle that signifies
this 11th meaning of take to go deeper
into story understanding consider this
simple story I took the candy from the
baby what is the meaning of the word
take care you and I get this immediately
but how can an agent get it to keep it
simple we have shown here just nine
meanings of take you could have added
the other three as well although we
cited with bottom-up processing we are
now going to shift it top-down
processing because there's something
about the background knowledge about
candy that we have which is going to
eliminate lots of choices in particular
we know that candy is not a medicine so
this particular choice goes away we know
that candy is not a quantity so this
choice goes away several destroys has
disappeared because of our background
knowledge of candy just like some of the
constraints came from over background
knowledge of the semantic category of
candy other constraints come from over
background knowledge of the preposition
from in the table showing prepositions
earlier from refer to a source these
three frames do not have anything to do
with the source and therefore we
eliminate them we left only with this
particular frame which has source in it
as required by the proposition from and
thus we decide that the interpretation
of took in this particular sentence is
to steal from a baby and thus we infer
the correct interpretation of taking
this particular sentence it refers to to
steal this is the only frame that is
still active</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
