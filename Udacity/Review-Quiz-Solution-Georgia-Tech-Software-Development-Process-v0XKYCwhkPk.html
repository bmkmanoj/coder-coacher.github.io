the reason for this is because this code
is unreachable this is dead code because
no matter the value of je this condition
will always be false because I will
always be zero and notice that this is a
small example but another important
truth is that any non-trivial program
contains dead or unreachable code code
that no matter how well we test our
system we will never be able to exercise
why is that there is reasons for example
defensive programming or for example
developing for future releases so there
might be pieces of code that are added
but they're still not activated they're
still not involved by any other part of
the code because of modifications to the
code there are some part they were
executed before and in the new version
of the program there are no longer
exercise they are no longer executable
but there still remain in the code base
and this is a very very normal situation
for these reasons and many more and this
is an important concept because this
affects the very meaning of coverage
measures if there is some unreachable
code we will never be able to reach a
hundred-percent code coverage and in
fact if you remember at the beginning of
the lesson we discussed this concept and
ask you why you think that in industry
the target for coverage is not a hundred
percent but less than that and that's
the answer to comfort the fact there are
in feasibility problems that I have to
take into account when I test the code
infeasible paths and executable
statements conditions that can never be
true and so on so most criteria if not
all are affected and we need to take
that into account when we try to achieve
a given coverage target</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
