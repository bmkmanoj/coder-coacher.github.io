statements like a return statement we
could throw an exception now we're in a
great position to code up function calls
which will have to set up a new
environment and catch the return values
once again we extract this statement
type from our abstract syntax tree and
now we want to handle function calls
there are two parts to a function call
abstract syntax tree the name of the
function like absolute value or my fun
or square root and then the arguments
and because a function may have one two
three or more arguments we just have a
list of expressions function name may
mean different things in different
contexts just like any other variable so
we'll go look it up in the current
environment we're going to have to
decide what it means for something to be
a function for something like an integer
or a string we can just use a Python
integer or a string for a function we're
going to use a tuple where the first
part is function so that we know one
when we see it then there's a list of
formal parameters then there's the body
and then there's the environment and
we'll see how that comes into play later
for now I'm just going to promise that
this is how functions will turn out and
later in the next step will make that
promise true by having function
definitions produce these four tuple
values so we'll just pull out the
function parameters the function body in
the function environment for example if
we're still calling square root square
roots official formal parameter name
might be X when we passed in the
particular actual argument to one of the
goals in our interpreter is to rule out
bad code one easy mistake to make is to
pass in the wrong number of arguments to
have a different number of actual
arguments and formal parameters we'll
just check for that now they're both
lists compare their lengths otherwise we
have to make a new environment frame
which I'll leave for you to do and then
we want to evaluate the body in that new
frame we'll have to make a new
environment frame and follow all of
those steps make potentially spaces in
the new frame for the formal parameters
and assign to them the values of the
actual arguments so be quite a bit to do
in here and then we want to evaluate the
body in the new frame and we're going to
do that with exception handling will try
doing something you tell me
and ideally we will get to the end and
somewhere in the middle we'll have
raised that special exception holding
the return value if that happens we'll
return the return value otherwise the
user wrote code without a return
statement we'll just return none all the
way up topside they're trying to call
something like square root square root
better be a function and not some string
or some number all the way down here we
check for that if we try to call
something that was not a function we'll
just print out an error here's your quiz
fill in these two pieces of code so that
we correctly handle function calls and
it's worth noting that this quiz is
pretty tricky this is a little more
programming than we normally ask you to
do</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
