our data set that we're looking at
before so again the idea is that we're
gonna try to find a way of predicting
the value for various points along the
way in this curve and one thing we could
do is find the best line but we also
talk now about finding the best constant
it turns out these all belong to a
family of functions that we could fit
which are functions of this form right
we've got X as our input and what we're
going to do is we're going to take some
constant and add that to some scaled
version of x times some scaled version
of x squared plus some scaled version of
X cubed all the way up to some order K
and we've talked about K equals 0 the
constant function and K equals 1 the
line but there's also K equals 2 a
parabola would it probably be a good
choice in this particular case yes it
does seem like it's got sort of you know
curvy downy nature right mm-hmm but it's
going up but then it's kind of
flattening out and maybe we could
imagine that it starts coming down again
at least over the course of these points
it doesn't come down again but at least
it sort of flattens out so let's take a
look at that let's take a look at the
the best parabola to fit this all right
so so here we go we've got the the best
line now the best constant function
which is just the average we have the
best line with some slope to it that's
the green one we have now the best
problem look at that does it does a nice
job right kind of gets gets tucked in
with all those other points so so what
do you think is this the best way of
capturing this this particular set of
points well if the only thing we care
about is minimizing the sum of squared
error my guess is that the parabola has
less squared error yeah it has there's
more degrees of freedom and so at the
worst we could have just fit the
parabola as a line right we can always
just set any of these coefficients to
zero so if the best fit to this really
was a line the best fit to this data
point was a line then the parabola that
we see here wouldn't have any curve to
it so so yeah we are errors going down
as we've gone from order zero to order
one to order two so can you think of any
other way of getting the error to go
down even more
how about order 14,000,000 interesting
well in this particular case given the
data that we have we can't go past the
number of data points after that they're
really unconstrained
how about order 9 order 9 is a good idea
but just to give you an idea here we're
gonna step up a little more this is
order 4 and look it look at how lovely
it can actually capture the flow here
that's a very faded order 6 and in fact
the best that we can do here is sorry
the most the highest order that works is
order 8 and son-of-a-gun look what it
did it it hit every single point dead-on
in the center boom boom-boom-boom it
used all the degrees of freedom it had
to reduce the error to essentially zero
excellent so one could argue that this
is a really good idea though if you look
at what happens around 9000 there's some
craziness do you see that or the yeah
the to try to get this particular
parabola to hit that particular point it
sent the curve soaring downward then up
again well also do that between
sixty-five hundred and eighty five
hundred it's scented oh yes good point
well right right that's right it went
went off the top of the plot so yeah
that's kind of interesting but let's
just just to show that we really are as
we have more degrees of freedom we're
fitting the error better let me show you
what it looks like the amount of error
that we got for the best fit for each of
these orders of K all right and so so
what you see when we actually plot the
the squared error this function that
we're trying to minimize as we go from
order 0 to order one order two or three
or four to five all the way to 8x8 there
is no error left because it nailed every
single point so you know that's kind of
good but it doesn't feel quite right
like the curves that we're getting there
looked a little bit crazy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
