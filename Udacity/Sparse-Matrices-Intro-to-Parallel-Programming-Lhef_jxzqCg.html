sparse matrix is what we call compressed
sparse row so here's a small matrix of
nine elements three of them are zeros
and so we want some sort of
representation that's going to squeeze
out those zeros and only represent the
values that are nonzero and it seems a
little silly on a small matrix like this
but trust me as you get to very large
matrices with lots and lots of zeros
this representation is going to save you
a lot of space and save you a lot of
computation so in CSR format we require
three vectors that together are going to
represent this sparse matrix so the
first one is what we call the value
vector and it is simply going to
represent all the nonzero data so here
we're simply going to list all the data
that are not zero has one long array the
second array that we need is recording
which column each of these data came
from so for instance a is in column zero
B is in column two C is in column zero
and so on and finally we have to
indicate at which element each one of
these three rows begin so the three rows
begin with values a and value C and
value F so what we're going to write in
the row pointer is that value a is it
index zero value C is it index 2 and
value F is it index five and now we can
reconstruct this sparse matrix with
these three arrays</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
