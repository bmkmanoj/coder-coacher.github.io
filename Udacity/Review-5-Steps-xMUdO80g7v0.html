about five different steps that are
important in creating a panorama first
of course is being able to capture
images we've looked at how cameras work
and how we should be able to use them to
capture images we'll talk a little bit
about it again here specific to Panama
building then we have actually discussed
how to detect and match features in
images pair of images or a sequence of
images that will allow us to do
alignment then of course we talked about
how we can warp an image to align the
images to kind of have no kinds of
ghostly artifacts then also we actually
looked at how we can do blending both at
the frequency level to be able to kind
of merge images we can fade images and
cut images the final part cropping you
know how to do it's rather easy is
basically changing of course the domain
of the image itself that is finding the
range are the the number of columns and
number of pixels that we want to
actually use to do cropping cropping of
course is the last step in it's an
optional step to be able to kind of now
just create a rectangular image out of a
series of images that we used to build a
panorama and in essence it's really
about finding the right number of rows
and columns and the pixels to create a
rectangular image</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
