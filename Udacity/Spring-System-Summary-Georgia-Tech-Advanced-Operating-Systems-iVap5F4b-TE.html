primitives available in the spring
system object orientation object
technology permeates the entire
operating system design it's used as a
system structuring mechanism in
constructing a network operating system
to break it down in spring system you
have the nucleus which provides you
threads and IPC among threads and the
microkernel prescription of lead-k is
accomplished by the combination of
nucleus plus the address base management
that is part of the spring systems
kernel boundary and everything else
lives above this kernel meaning all the
services that you normally associate
with an operating system such as file
system Network communication and so on
they are all provided as objects that
live outside of this kernel and the way
you access those objects is through
doors and in every domain there is a
door table there is a set of
capabilities that a particular domain
has for accessing doors on different
domains and this door and door table is
the basis for cross domain calls and
through the object orientation and
through the network proxies you can have
object invocation implemented as
protected procedure called both on the
same node and across machines and
finally it does virtual memory
management by providing certain basic
primitives such as the linear address
space the memory object external pages
and cached object representation now to
contrast this to tornado in tornado also
we saw that it was using object
technology but the contrast is pretty
distinct in tornado it uses clustered
object as an optimization for
implementing kernel services for example
whether a particular object is a
singleton representation or has multiple
representation for each process or etc
those are the kinds of optimizations
that are being accomplished using the
clustered object in
Tornado system whereas in the spring
system object technology permeates the
entire operating system design in that
it is used as a system structuring
mechanism not as just an optimization
mechanism in constructing a network
operating system</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
