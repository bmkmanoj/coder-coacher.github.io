automatic processes of vision and
perception when pre-attentive processing
occurs we were able to instantly
recognize an element in a visualization
it's the same reason why this blue bar
becomes instantly apparent in this
forest of orange bars here I'm using
color in particular hue as a
pre-attentive attribute I could also use
color intensity to create the same
effect here to bars pop out from the
page so color hue and color intensity
can be used as pre-attentive attributes
but there are also other pre-attentive
attributes that can we can use to
highlight information or to lead the eye
and visualizations in Colin wares book
information visualization perception for
design he describes four general
categories for these attributes and they
are color form movement and spatial
position we can change the form of
objects such as their line width
curvature size or in this case the shape
movement is another form of
pre-attentive processing for these
squares I'm using a flicker effect to
draw attention to one of them you might
have similar fade ins or fade outs for
portions of your visualization that are
interactive or those that highlight
particular data values or trends in a
visualization finally spatial position
can be employed as a pre-attentive
attribute you might find this useful for
drying the eye towards titles legends or
annotations for more examples of
pre-attentive processing check out the
links in the instructor notes as a side
note pre-attentive attributes can be
used together but they may achieve
different results here color and form
are used notice that form either a
square or a circle is randomly
distributed throughout the grid but the
color attribute creates a clean boundary
down the grid in this example the
reverse is true color is randomly
distributed to shapes throughout this
grid but notice that form does not do
the partitioning of the grid as well as
in this previous example in the second
example the horizontal shape boundary is
masked by color or hue</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
