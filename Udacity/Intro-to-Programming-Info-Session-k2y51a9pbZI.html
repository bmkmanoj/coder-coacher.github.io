am also Kelly but not our dime Kelly
Shores and I'm the product lead here at
Udacity for a few of our programs
including the introduction to
programming nanodegree program and so
today we thought we would just give you
a little bit more information about what
this program is who it's for and what it
will get you and then we'll open it up
to some questions to see if we can help
clarify what our program offering is
cool so that's great so yeah so I PMD is
kind of our internal name but that
stands for intro to programming and
degree
so I guess to really start and step back
what is Udacity and yeah what is it to
death so currently we're here at Udacity
headquarters in Mountain View and we are
an online education platform are all of
our programs we have nano degree
programs that teach in-demand skills for
jobs within tech and tech adjacent roles
we also have industry partnerships that
help fuel our content within our
programs as well as our hiring partner
you have some so we work with them to
actually hire students into future
careers getting new promotions etc so
those Pro so those companies are
companies such as Google Nvidia
mercedes-benz lyft etc and so our nano
degrees are essentially collections of
courses and lessons that build up to
make you job ready in some field so
whether our front front end nanodegree
program back-end data analyst all of
these programs will make you job ready
our introduction to programming
nanodegree program is a little bit
different it's actually going to provide
you all of the skills and prerequisites
so that you are ready for one of these
career ready nano degree programs so the
curriculum and IP Andy really focuses on
bringing you up to speed on general
programming minds
set and methods so that when you jump
into some of our more advanced career
ready programs you'll be ready for it so
the program starts with learn to code
which is a really high-level view of how
the web works a little bit about HTML
and CSS which are the languages of web
pages um you'll build your own web page
from scratch which is pretty tight and
you'll learn how to style it make it
custom colors put in images videos that
kind of thing and then we'll dive into
learning what programming is I'm using
Python so we we picked Python because
it's a really accessible easy language
to start with it's really
straightforward it kind of flows off the
tongue kind of like English so it's
really nice in that way so we have a
project called code your own quiz where
you will essentially make a mad libs
generator and you'll be have you'll have
to solve like for what each of the
blanks are cool I think I've seen some
of those examples and are made with
Udacity has like where students share
the projects that they work in
throughout their nano degree programs so
that's exciting to see those first
quizzes and projects come to life and
then we also get into object-oriented
programming also with Python and through
that course and project you'll end up
creating a movie website so you'll use
Python to generate a website that shows
a bunch of movies and we'll play their
trailers and that type of links that's
pretty cool at the very end of IP Andy
we allow students to kind of choose
their own adventure so essentially
they'll get to choose one of the
different learning paths like front end
back end data analysis or iOS or Android
development and we have them take the
first couple of lessons from those nano
degree programs and submit one of the
final projects as like their capstone
cool ok so then that's kind of whatever
their interest is in that final project
we recommend they go into those programs
so if you're if you really loved Python
and intro to programming
reprogram you should go into probably
back-end or a data analyst yeah and so
with that the students will get to
actually submit one of those projects
that's in one of the nanodegree programs
and so if you do enroll in one of those
future programs you'll already have
credit for that project so won't equal
yeah so this slide is basically showing
what those projects are just the names
of them and all of our nano degree
programs are built around these projects
where you get real-world experience
creating you know whether it's a website
that's a movie quiz or an app when you
move on to like say Android development
whatever it is we're building out a
portfolio that you can later show to
employers or that larger programming
community I guess yeah exactly so
throughout the program you'll have video
instruction and text and quizzes and
that kind of thing but what really makes
Udacity z' programs a little bit
different is that you do have this like
you submit a project file and we have
reviewers that will review and give you
code review actually line by line code
review which is really cool you'll
really get a good idea on like best
practices and that kind of thing
directly on the work that you're doing
so it's a really quick way to see and
level up your skills that's really
helpful yeah so a lot of people ask what
the requirements are for introduction to
programming actually there really aren't
too many requirements it's pretty cool
and I like hearing that right so
honestly basic computer skills like that
kind of okay that includes like
downloading programs onto your computer
zipping files file organization on your
computer I know that like for me for
example I have like tons of files and
things all over my desktop computer but
I don't know knowing how to organize
those okay and seeing where your files
are on the computer is a useful skill
you also do need a computer that's you
know either a Mac Windows R
running Linux okay and then as far as
programming experience you actually
don't need any that's like the whole
point of the program is to provide you
with that programming experience as like
the stepping stone so you don't even
need to have use HTML and you're like
old myspace profile yeah I mean that's
it that's a great advantage but yeah you
don't have to have any of those skills
will will take you from actually ground
zero all the way up through having some
familiarity with programming great so
yeah well what you'll you learn so the
main languages that we use to teach the
programming mindset are HTML CSS and
Python the reason we start out with HTML
and CSS is to actually give students a
really tangible visual of what you can
do by writing a few lines of code using
some language with some syntax and
seeing a result immediately so HTML and
CSS are the building blocks of websites
so that's a really tangible result for
students to start out with okay and then
I'm actually gonna include that quote in
our Facebook live chat right now and
then we also use Python for our
programming language of choice it's very
it's very popular it's very heavily used
in most big tech companies right now and
it's really accessible there aren't a
lot of exceptions and idiosyncrasies
like some other languages out there and
so it's a really great learning learning
language so I know that's a question
that people always have like if I want
to get into programming I don't work in
program in at all where should I start
right HTML CSS Python yeah I mean those
are great out there I mean I I love so
many other languages as well I love
JavaScript
I love Ruby there's really a ton of
languages out there but honestly as long
as you start with one and really
understand how programming works and
just the programmers mindset the logic
just general programming thinking then
whatever language you start with you'll
be able to apply that knowledge to
whatever other language that you need to
learn which is really cool yeah so
general outcomes of the program you'll
be prepared to take
any of those programs that we started
with for the specialization that final
project so you can jump into our
front-end web developer nanodegree you
can jump into back-end or full stack as
we call it now and then any iOS or
Android courses Android basics and data
analyst okay yeah
are there specific so say someone wants
to I don't know where would be an option
just focus on building like the database
structure of a company's website I know
that that's further down the line in
experience level but would you then go
into like back-end yeah yeah so our full
staff degrees right now yeah multiple
people namings for that one obey our
full SEC nanodegree program would be
really great for that you learn SQL in
there which is one of the languages they
use for databases and so we actually I
don't actually have a slide for that but
within the backend path within IP and E
you will learn SQL to build start
building it on databases okay yeah great
so I think we've gotten to the question
portion we have I'm here on Facebook
seeing questions that you post in real
time so please feel free to send your
questions and now but we also have a few
questions that people send to us in
advance on Facebook and our LinkedIn and
Twitter profiles so I will ask other
Kelly at these questions now so we have
one question that's what kind of career
backgrounds do intro to programming nano
degree students typically come from it's
probably all over oh yeah so I mean our
students kind of come from all
industries that you can imagine honestly
we have folks that are like managers at
their companies folks that have studied
science they might be biologists
chemical engineers all sorts of folks we
have educators folks that are within the
education space that might want to move
into the tech field and then we have
tons of students so students that are
maybe in college currently or taking
vocational classes
and they want additional ways to up
their skillset as they're learning okay
yeah another question we got was which
programming languages consumes expect to
study but I think you pretty much
covered that so we have another question
that sort of related that came in on
Facebook that's what about Java I know
that that's kind of a language that
people will get intimidated by some own
friends that have taken job courses in
the past where does that come into play
yeah so we don't teach Java at all in
intro to programming you'll find Java
within our Android development
nanodegree program yeah so if if you
wanted to learn Java specifically for
like Android development where it's
pretty common then that's where you
would go to take that okay great I love
omena I hope I'm pronouncing that right
s-- question say really as someone who
wasn't great in math in high school I
flunked math in high school can I do
this program uh yes yes definitely so I
I have to be honest like depending on
the type of like high schools and stuff
math isn't always taught in the most
accessible way and math really isn't a
prerequisite to starting to learn how to
program with introduction of programming
we start with a really more holistic
approach to figuring out how to go about
logic which is really what math comes
down to it's like knowing like what
steps to execute and when and what's
happening during that process and so
yeah if you don't have a really strong
background in math that that that
shouldn't get you from being able to
jump into programming for sure okay yeah
great yeah I just did not remember
geometry high school oh my god it was
not a great learning experience but this
is also that also goes to some of the
benefits of the intro to nano degree
intro to programming nano degree program
here at Udacity is that you have this
community built in wonder when you start
the program there are other students
we've had how many graduates of the
program now um there's almost 3,000
graduates now so well and then they're
all on slack which is a chat forum
that we use where they can talk about
projects that they're working on yes we
have we actually are slack community so
most of our nanodegree programs use
slack as just a community chat with all
of the students and we have about 8,000
students in our IP and d-flat community
right now just pretty cool Wow it got
really big from all over the world all
over the world so all the time zones are
covered so I'm sure there will be
someone up and online where whatever
time down here from but we have channels
within the slack community that are
dedicated to each part of the program
and so when students at stuck they can
work through the problems together and
it's really great there's like the the
community is really supportive
regardless of what skill level and what
background like everyone is so excited
to like help each other out constantly
yeah so and it kind of did you dusty
alumni network in general like they will
have meetups even after they graduated
from whether it's a beginner program
like intro to programming or if it's one
of the more career ready programs like I
don't know our artificial intelligence
nanodegree program they really love just
meeting up with us meeting up with each
other and whatever city they're in
around the world there's there's that
really solid community for you out there
too yeah and honestly like our alumni
network at Udacity is like 25,000
graduates right now which is giant and
so as a graduate from introduction to
programming you get this giant network
of support to figure out okay if I want
to do a career that is you know through
one of the mandatory programs there's so
many people that have had that
experience that are like more than happy
to give advice and help out with those
types of decisions so it's pretty great
okay I have another question there are
some great questions coming in from
Facebook
one this is from Tori what are some good
indicators front-end or back-end which
we called full stack now is suitable for
you like skills personality traits etc
how do you know if you're a front-end
developer versus full spec yeah I mean
there's a there's a few a few aspects of
both that could be good indicator so
front-end developers are really looking
at the user experience and how how
somebody will interact with a website so
they'll use HTML CSS and JavaScript
another programming language to work on
the front-end interaction space
javascript is a great language that will
like any of the interaction elements on
any websites that you see like buttons
forms that kind of big leagues and click
now yeah exactly so a front-end
developer is really focused on making
sure the front end of a website is set
up to collect data for the back end
engineer so the back end engineer will
be setting up the database will be
setting up what kind of objects are
being stored there and will be really
like the behind the scenes you have said
so if it kind of depends I guess that's
a little bit on personality if you're
you know wanting to be upfront or you
know kind of behind the scenes I guess
that would be one way to kind of
describe I know one of our engineers
Jonathan Wow probably doesn't he has
told me that he loves fret and because
he also has an art background so he also
has worked in graphic design so he loves
being able to see immediately the
actions that he's making in programming
come to life on the website
totally yeah and it really depends on
like the size of the company that you
work at if you're at a really small
company as a front-end engineer you're
maybe going to do all sorts of skills
that include doing the design and the
DUI but at bigger companies a friend an
engineer might just be implementing the
designs from the design team so kind of
it the role kind of varies based on the
company
and you know how everything is set up
yeah probably all roles across
programming yeah world ratio or
technical roles yeah I love this
question from Nikolas because we hear
this quite often just throughout Udacity
all of our different programs I'm 45 and
coming from a non tech industry and want
to make a career change to a developer
is it too late
it's definitely not too late never too
late yeah I think anybody can learn at
any age what like the basics of
programming and to just jump right in it
I was actually I had my dad check out
some of our programs and he's been a
pharmacist all of his life so in non
tech and I think it's like really
exciting to see folks that have had
different careers and different
backgrounds jump into something that's
brand new it's it's exciting and I mean
as long as you're curious and you have
the energy to just jump into something
brand new like you just go for it
yeah it's a great opportunity and that
speaks to our kind of Udacity ethos of
lifelong learning where it's just it's
never too late to learn something new I
mean we have this community of 3,000
graduates 25,000 did you say 25,000
25,000 nanodegree graduates nanodegree
graduates 3000i P&amp;amp;D graduates but
they're all there to support you and
we've we've talked to people of just
various ages different backgrounds from
different regions different income
brackets etc I mean we're all able to
kind of encourage each other and find a
way yeah let's see this has come up in a
few ways on Facebook - but someone asks
us in advance what advantages do a
program like these nano degree programs
or intro to programming in general have
over that traditional four-year
university education yeah that's a good
question so traditional education is
great but the the advantage that
online learning and online at Tech space
is that you can access a huge range of
community right just like worldwide so
many different people that have great
perspectives to add to the learning
process and so what you get is this
online education that's really taken in
feedback from so many different
perspectives and I've been iterating on
it so like all of our programs we're
constantly updating the content making
things more accessible and easier to
learn identifying those like knowledge
gaps and able to change that really
quickly in traditional education
changing a curriculum from what I
understand can take many years yeah and
so Udacity is able to move at a really
quick pace to make those changes so that
our programs are constantly impactful I
think that language trends change
exactly and especially like within the
field of tech like language changes all
the time like for example updates like
every year so we need to keep our
content updated to match what's
currently being used in the industry
this to summarize this question from
Jessica on Facebook lab she's basically
asking okay after you've taken this
intro that beginner classes that we
offer and you're ready to move into
career ready programs you have the
nanodegree program certification that
you get after you graduated program but
no experience in the field how do you
move through that my instinct is that
you have your projects to show but maybe
you have some insight yeah so it's a
it's a really tough transition I I would
say but luckily for our career ready
nano degree programs we do have an
amazing careers team and so actually
there's a ton of additional career
resources to help bridge that gap so
that that's not available within
introduction to programming because it's
not career ready but for some of our
other programs they'll have
practice interviews will do technical
interview preparation job search advice
and actually within the alumni community
there's they constantly post like job
through job options and stuff and so
there is definitely a lot of Udacity
support to help like once you graduate
okay there's like you know some limbo in
there like okay now what how do I get
the job yeah the hardest part right yeah
so our career services generally cover
that so let's get into the nitty-gritty
these are questions that people asked us
in advance too but also Coral just asked
us on Facebook I'm a wife and mother
with full-time job and I dream of
learning programming how much time do I
need to commit to graduate from the
program cool a great question um so on
average our students take about four and
a half months or so to finish the
introduction to programming nandri
however I would I have seen students
that have completed the program within a
month so it really depends on how many
hours per week you intend to dedicate to
the program we estimate about a ten hour
per week commitment will get you to that
average four and a half months
graduation but it also you know it's a
variable right it depends on the
learning speed and like how how much
time you can really focus on like the
project building so I think the projects
will definitely take the longer younger
part and longer the actual technical
exact trails yeah so I would say just
under five months is you can expect to
be able to graduate if you're committed
weekly throughout that time okay and
then how much would that cost how much
is the full you know five month program
cost or if there's any other years I
guess so right now we actually have two
options for payment for I PMD students
the first option is that they can
purchase five months of access for a
discounted rate so it's 399 US dollars
or they can purchase a monthly
subscription and that's 499 dollars per
month
okay so if you do the math you save
about a hundred bucks
if you choose the 5-month upfront option
but if you're planning on going through
the program really really quickly like
fewer than five months then taking the
monthly subscription option would make
out it makes more sense yeah would you
say in your experience this this was a
question that came in ahead of time
ahead of this live stream but maybe this
might be hard to answer what personality
traits do programmers usually have or
are there such a thing is there such a
thing as a programmer with an innate
ability or this is something hmm can
this be learned well yes it can be
learned but I'm a big believer in that I
mean for me personally like I went from
having zero programming experience to
being a full-stack developer within a
couple months Wow a few years ago okay I
know it can be done it can be done I had
a chemistry background it was very
different chemistry and art okay but I
think some of the key some of the key
personalities that I see succeeding
through these programs are students that
are genuinely curious they genuinely
want to learn how things work and why
they work and they ask those big
questions like okay I see this happened
but how did it happen
you know what what were the things that
led up to it so curiosity I think is a
big one and then just like some element
of grit like you're committed to you
know strength through struggle you have
mentality where it'll get hard and it'll
get tricky but you want to persevere
because you know that other people have
done it before you and that you can like
push through the times where it gets a
little bit tough to work through some
maybe concepts and we have some great on
Udacity comm we have some great student
success stories too where they just talk
about like the determination that they
had where they're either working in
another full-time job completely
unrelated to the tech space where they
came home you know put their baby to bed
and then started working on this too in
their spare time yeah
let's see what other sort of questions
do we have on Facebook live there have
been some really great ones someone who
loves your programming experience but
this program intro to programming you
nanodegree wouldn't have to be you don't
have to necessarily devote two hours a
day to the program it's just whenever
you can really work on it like to know
exactly yeah and I would say that it's a
good idea to spend at least at least two
days out of your week dedicated to
learning I feel like if you go too long
without touching the material you'll
kind of lose some of that so you're kind
of gonna like jump forward and then go
back a little and jump forward and go
back and so having some type of constant
reminder of the concepts that you've
learned in constant practice is a really
big help to like really solidifying
those concepts yeah so I would say like
some type of regularity within the
gradual is really useful that's a great
point um I think we have just about time
for one more question and this might be
this is from someone probably very
loosely interested in programming but
are there free courses that Udacity has
that they that you would recommend they
try before they start at the interested
programmer yeah we have tons of free
courses if you look at our course
catalog online and we can link to that
later we have our introduction to HTML
and CSS we have JavaScript basics we
have introduction to get and github
which is a common tool that programmers
will use to upload and share files so
there's there's tons of courses online
that we offer for free so if you just
kind of want to get experience within
the Udacity environment yeah figuring
out what great option online learning is
yeah so all of our free courses there's
videos and text and quiz content but you
won't see any projects that's a big
differentiator is that you won't
actually be submitting any projects for
review and also you won't have all of
the students support like a classroom
mentor or the slack community so like
it'll it'll kind of be like a program
like
okay okay and then you don't have that
code review either examines the
reviewers of project yeah yeah okay
great I think that's about all we have
time for thank you everyone from around
the world who is watched we will put a
link there is actually a link right now
in the Facebook field where you can
learn more about our in charge of
programming nanodegree led by kelly here
but thanks for tuning in we'll see you
around
thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
