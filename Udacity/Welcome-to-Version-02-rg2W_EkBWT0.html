brother palter he loves phones and
shopping so oh hi um alright so well the
question today is what do you want to
shopping list app that's a great
question what do you think palter well I
think we owe okay i know in story toes
whoa interrupt much um sorry Paul it's
palter it's a family name okay um to
clarify multi-touch insta rito interface
I have a better idea what about an app
that lets you take regular drivers like
you and me and pick each other up and go
to the grocery store isn't that uber 0
or 64-bit synchronized insta reto
support what is that even look I think
we really need to be focusing on the gut
reaction right so maybe even a swipe
support so swipe right for cream puffs
Brian know that that's ridiculous we
must be swiping for their food all day
now cloud-based API this is a shopping
list app right all right mmhmm yeah I'm
not even sure how you add stuff to the
list how do you add item to the list
okay so I've got a great idea about what
to do next yeah I was intrigued by
developing that in story to a p.i but I
think we should focus on building out
the core app functionality here let me
show you here's our wireframes again and
inversion to the app we're going to work
on the shopping list screen and the
shopping list detail screen right now
the shopping list screen only has one
list but instead what I want is for us
to have a collection of lists now you
should be able to click on each of these
lists and it'll take you to a shopping
list detail screen which is where will
actually show what items are in the list
and then we'll be allowing users to
collaboratively add and remove items
from any of these lists to do that you
and the developer are going to need to
know a lot more than just said value
you'll need to master the different
methods of reading and writing with
firebase all right ready to start coding</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
