references the object 3 what is an
integer so it has type int after the
next assignment now X references the
string hello you daesh's one which has
type stir at this point well we're
inside the definition of the function
double double takes a parameter named X
note that this is a different X from
that X this X is defined inside the body
of the double procedure this one is
visible outside it we don't actually
know what object this X reference is yet
it doesn't reference to the object until
we call double and pass in a value so
it's value is actually unknown so at
this point the object X would reference
is unknown and the type of X is also
unknown but importantly this is a
different X from that one the type of
that X is still type stir after the last
assignment and I didn't make this part
of the quiz the type of X is now type
function and the point of this quiz is
to illustrate that Python types are
dynamic and the real emphasis of that is
the fact that the type of X at this
point could be unknown we can define a
function have a variable named X it
doesn't have a type until it's
associated with an object</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
