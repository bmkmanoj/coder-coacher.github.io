white they're actually colored okay
usually it's like disgusting dirty brown
because they're really sloppy eaters
anyway
so instead of clustering in just the
intensity space we could cluster in RGB
space so this is notionally drawn here
right where you can see that each point
now belongs to a different color cluster
and here they are and so you're grouping
these pixels based upon their color so
now you're doing a quantization in
3-dimensional space
here's a nice example of using color
instead of intensity this original image
here and you can see if you take a look
at sort of the the the clustering based
upon intensity over here it doesn't do a
particularly interesting job of
segmenting the cabbage from the broccoli
which is something you should always do
because you like one and not the other
all right but over here you can see that
based upon the different colors you get
the different segments and it's not
rocket science but it's just this idea
that you have some things that have the
similar intensity but are very different
in their chroma right they're their
colors and we talked about color space
last time all right
notice however this pepper here and this
pepper there this system does not know
at all that those two peppers are
distinct right because the only thing it
uses to create these clusters is the
distance in color space you might ask
can I do something smarter can I do
something smarter thank you very much
yes you can include not only clustering
and say intensity but you can also
cluster so here we have we have this
little part of the black ear and this
dark part of the eye and you might want
them to be in separate clusters well how
would you do that very simple instead of
just clustering on intensity you would
add the position as well so now we have
a three dimensional space of intensity
no intensity x and y or as shown here
intensity x and y here we have the black
pixels together they're low in intensity
but separated in different areas in x
and y and so you would get a different
two different clusters and of course if
you've got intensity and you can do
position you have connect color and you
can do position and the point here is
that your feature vector is getting
longer looking for features that you'd
all like or as many as possible to be
similar in order to say that everything
is in the same cluster so notice that if
I include the X and y here so for
example these two pixels is green up on
the top left and the green and the
bottom left
they can't be clustered in the same
segment because they're different along
some dimension namely the Y dimension
all right so that's that's the utility
of adding these dimensions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
