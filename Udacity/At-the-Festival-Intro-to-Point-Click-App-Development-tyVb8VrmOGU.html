minja music festival yes that seems like
a very big problem managing a music
festival how do you approach a problem
that big I mean there are a lot of
aspects to a music festival right so the
easiest way to go about it would be
first to think about it from a high
level okay to sort of understand what it
means to be a music festival
exactly so break it down into the
components we want to track like we go
to a music festival last weekend what
did we see there yeah it was really
interesting because you know we were
both there at the same festival but
we're definitely focusing on different
aspects like I was digging the music the
art the crowds and you were paying
attention to some things I had never
thought of before I mean don't get me
wrong I was definitely paying attention
to the music and the crowd too and that
was awesome but I was also really
impressed by the overall structure of
the event right and that was something
that I had never really considered
before I mean from a logistics point of
view it was all really pretty impressive
there's so much planning that had to go
into the organizing of multiple stages
and bands I mean making sure that
everyone would have the right equipment
there were ticket collectors security
guards food vendors I mean so much stuff
that all had to be planned and managed
so for now let's just start small and
focus on how to manage and keep track of
one aspect of the festival the attendees
right because it seems reasonable that a
festival manager would want to keep
track of the people going I'm not sure
what would this person actually want to
track about these attendees what would
they how would they do it
so yeah let's let's think about</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
