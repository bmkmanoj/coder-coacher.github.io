answer would be a and B and any of those
four cdef all right so let's think about
what would happen in that case so if we
start off the Centers there the first
step is going to be for every point to
join whichever cluster its closest to so
a is just gonna be with a me is just
gonna be with B and then D is gonna
slurp up all these other four points
right all right so now in the next
iteration it's going to recompute the
Centers and a and B aren't going to
change this cluster the center is going
to change to here and now it's never
going to make any additional progress so
those are the three clusters it'll find
if it starts off with those kind of bad
initial points so how would we go about
avoiding that sort of thing ah yes I was
going to ask you exactly that question
so it's given that we're thinking about
this as a hill climbing process that's a
local optimum and we had a pretty good
way of dealing with local optima and
that was random restarts that's one
possibility another thing that people
sometimes do is they'll do a quick
analysis of the space and actually try
to find initial cluster centers that
kind of are spread out so pick a cluster
Center and then pick the next cluster
Center to be as far away from all the
other cluster centers as you can so kind
of do like the I don't know the convex
hull of the space and try to pick points
near the corners or something like that
yes yeah that's right hmm so I think
you've done another thing too now that I
say that out loud which is you've been
choosing these random places to start
your centers as always being one of the
points I guess you didn't have to do
that yes but it probably helps that you
do it certainly keeps the center's near
the points another thing you can do to
get things started is just randomly
assign everybody to clusters but that
can often have the property that all the
Centers of those clusters end up being
kind of really close to each other so by
picking points to be the clusters it
does have a tendency to spread things
out okay that makes sense that's not a
proof step no proof by that makes sense</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
