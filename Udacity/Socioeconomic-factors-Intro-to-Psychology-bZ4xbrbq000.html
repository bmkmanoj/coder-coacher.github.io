families of a professional status
middle-class or welfare and what they
found was that children from the
professional families heard on average
2153 words per hour children in the
middle-class family heard on average
1251 words per hour and the children in
the welfare families heard on average
616 words per hour therefore we see that
the type of family that the child was in
had a great impact on the overall number
of words that they heard but that's not
all that means that for children in the
professional family they heard
approximately 11 million words per year
those in the middle class families heard
approximately 6 million words per year
and then finally those in the welfare
group heard approximately 3 million
words per year Hart and Risley found
that by age 4 the children from the
welfare families could have heard about
30 million fewer words compared to those
in the professional family but that's
not all let's look at one more important
finding from Hart and Risley</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
