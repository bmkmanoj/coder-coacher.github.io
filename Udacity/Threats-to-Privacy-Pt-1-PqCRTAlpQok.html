privacy in the online context what kind
of information is private and what may
not be private let's talk about some
threads to privacy well on the Internet
we talked about a source of a request
that goes to a certain service or in a
destination and so we communicate
between you know two endpoints analysis
of you know who's talking to who
obviously think that who I communicate
with should be private of course this
traffic analysis is a threat to that it
can boil it or disclose that information
now the threat to privacy is of course
large-scale surveillance and you know
recently in fact this month this letter
from this encryption experts was
published about you know the law
enforcement agencies claimed that if we
allow encryption without sort of some
way to undo it or back doors and things
like that then you know it's like going
dark their ability to see what bad guys
are doing completely going away so there
are other people who are arguing against
that by saying this is sort of the
Golden Age of surveillance the amount of
information they can collect is
unprecedented so in some sense you know
everything you do online potentially can
be tracked and and collected information
about your activities can be collected
so if somebody is doing that of course
that's a massive threat to to privacy
finally you know with big data data
mining analytics that we have we can do
all kind of inferences and Link
different pieces of information okay we
when we talked about a database of
privacy we did discuss inference attacks
and anonymization and things like that
well those could be defeated in when we
have by linking different pieces of
information very simple advertise online
advertising they're sort of making a
guess that you visit certain website so
click on certain kind of links you'll be
interested in certain things</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
