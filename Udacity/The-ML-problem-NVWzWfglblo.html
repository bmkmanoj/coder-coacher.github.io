algorithms they build in terms of the
problems that they solve so this mini
course is about machine learning and
let's think about the problem the
machine learning solves in most cases
machine learning algorithms are focused
on building a model what's a model a
model is something that takes in
observations like this X here run it
through some sort of process and provide
a Y so this Y is typically a prediction
and the X is some sort of observation of
the world examples might be for us X are
some features of stocks and y is a
future price there are many other uses
of machine learning models that's just
one of them X can be multi-dimensional
in other words there might be multiple
factors that we're considering might be
Bollinger Bands p/e ratio and so on Y is
typically single dimension and just
represents that single dimension
prediction that we're trying to make now
there are lots of models that people
have built that don't use machine
learning at all one example is the black
Scholes model that predicts option
prices there are many other types of
models that predict things that people
build not using machine learning but
they developed mathematical formulas but
of course with machine learning we're
trying to use data so the machine
learning process is to take historical
data run it through a machine learning
algorithm of some sort to generate the
model then at runtime or when we need to
use the model we push X's in it and Y's
come out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
