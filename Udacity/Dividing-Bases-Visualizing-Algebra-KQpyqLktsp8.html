bases and exponents and this involves
division I can think about expanding
three to the fourth and three squared
just like before we can simplify common
factors in the numerator and denominator
they make one because we're working with
a fraction made up of factors we know
these make one so we're left with 3
times 3 or 3 squared we can think about
expanding these variables as well we
simplify common factors in the numerator
and in the denominator and relax with up
to the third this last one is just like
the others before except we need to do
something additional for the two numbers
or coefficients I know six divides into
twelve and six divides into eighteen 612
is two and six and 18 is three so I have
two thirds times W to the fifth I showed
you the expanded form and the
simplification so that we could look at
the pattern what's happening as we move
from the left side to the right side
what do you notice about the exponents
let's see if you can answer this with a
question what's a rule for the pattern
that you see over here you can write
your answer in this box and be sure that
it includes a base of X and involves
your exponents a and B what you do with
them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
