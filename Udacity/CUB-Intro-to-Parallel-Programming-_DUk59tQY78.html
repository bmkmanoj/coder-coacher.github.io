that can replace writing CUDA kernels in
many cases but for those times when you
are writing CUDA kernels you still like
to achieve software reuse you'd like to
identify the building blocks in your
kernel and use somebody else's highly
optimized implementation of those
building blocks and then stitch them
together with any custom code of your
own but software reuse in CUDA kernel
code faces some kind of special
challenges so suppose for example that
you were calling a library
implementation of say radix sort and
this is somebody else's implementation
you're going to call it from inside your
kernel and so the question is how does
that implementation know how many
threads it is running in how much shared
memory is it allowed to use can't use
all of the shared memory or have you
reserved some for other purposes should
it use a work efficient or a step
efficient algorithm for this piece of
the problem the answer probably depends
on what you're sorting how much you're
sorting and exactly what's important or
key right now the cub library by Dwayne
Merrill provides a neat solution to
these challenges of software reuse for
CUDA kernel coveted high-performance cub
stands for cuda unbound and the reason
it's called that is because the
implementation in cub leave these
decisions like the number of threads the
amount of shared memory unbound you the
programmer bind the necessary parameters
when you write your program using
templates and a novel binding approach
that's embedded in the C++ type system
the building blocks that cub provides
are really high performance
implementations so by stitching them
together you can create a
high-performance CUDA kernel and finally
because cub doesn't dictate things like
thread block size or shared memory usage
it allows you to experiment with these
values as you optimize or auto-tune your
code and one thing you'll find if you
get into optimizing CUDA code is that
this kind of auto tuning where you
experiment with or even sweep
automatically sweep the parameters of
your code things like the block size and
the shared memory size that's a really
powerful tool for extracting the maximum
amount of performance from your code
without investing a whole lot of
personal effort</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
