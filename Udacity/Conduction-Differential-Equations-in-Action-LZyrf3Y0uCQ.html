heat conduction along the wire just like
you saw in the unit we're going to split
the wire that we have into discrete
chunks in fact we're going to split it
into 100 different chunks numbered from
0 to 99 we can then measure the
temperature of each chunk and label that
with a proper number so for example the
temperature in the last chunk is going
to be labeled t99 as you already heard
from yarn the temperature in any given
segment let's take the 8th segment for
example depends on the temperature in
the surrounding two segments any
segments that are touching one another
are going to feed energy into each other
so the seventh and ninth segments can
both feed energy into the eighth in the
same way the eight segment is going to
feed energy into both the seventh in the
ninth segments to express the
temperature of the eighth segment after
a time step then we can use the finite
difference scheme to come up with this
equation right here this equation tells
us that the temperature after the time
step right here is equal to the
temperature before the time step plus
this term which we can see depends on
the initial temperatures of the seventh
ninth and eighth segments this is
obviously an explicit method for
calculating ta at time age but just for
a change of pace since this is a pretty
unstable solution we're going to try an
implicit method instead remember that
implicit means that you're going to have
this term over on this side as well so
we're just going to switch all these
zeros two H's you're going to use this
implicit method of course converting it
to code in this problem one problem that
we have to deal with is how to handle
the segments on either end of our wire
both of these have an adjacent segments
to one direction but not to the other
since their segments start at zero and
count up to 99 our problem where
explicitly is that we don't have a
segment number negative 1 Nora segments
numbered 100 to deal with this we're
just going to set the value of T
negative 12 equal T 0 and similarly
4,100 setting that to 299 this is going
to be true for all times T your main job
in this problem is going to be to find
the coefficients for every equation in
this set of equations right here each
equation involves an expression which is
just a sum of all the different
temperatures of every segment along with
some coefficients stuck in front of
certain ones and all of this equals the
initial temperature at that certain
segment this means that we have a set of
100 different equations when we consider
the system of a queen
as a whole we can actually think of it
more conveniently as dealing with
matrices this method right here numpy
metallic solve deals with equations
involving matrices we have a matrix of
the coefficients which are all of these
pink question marks multiplied by a
single column vector which contains all
the temperatures after time step age
these multiplied together equals this
vector which contains all the initial
values at the temperatures as we already
know the temperatures at x 0 and you
will have created a matrix of
coefficients we can use this method
numpy em at LG solve and input the known
information and solve for the vector
that we want the one contained the
temperatures after time step each taking
a look at our supplied code you can
state we've created an initial
temperature distribution for you we've
also created a parameter for you called
see which I think if you look back at
the finite difference formula you'll see
is going to be very useful for you as I
told you earlier your first task is
going to be to fill in the array named
coefficients with the appropriate values
remember a lot of the coefficients will
be 0 another hint that i want to give
you is that using for loops could be a
great way to fill in the coefficients to
all their different slots in the matrix
once coefficients is filled in come back
up to the step size and set it to 0
point 5 when you submit in the end you
should have a curve that looks nice and
smooth like this despite the pretty
large step size that we're going to be
using</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
