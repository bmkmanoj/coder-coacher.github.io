problems programmers run into especially
as your code gets larger and more
complicated it's almost impossible to
write bug free code from the first time
luckily IntelliJ has this amazing
feature called debugging remember those
side tables that we used to draw when we
were tracing our code in earlier lessons
well IntelliJ allows you to do the same
thing by peeking into values of any
variable in your code while it's running
and if your code has any bug in it this
would make your job finding that bug a
lot easier let's have a quick look at
one of the very early programs that we
wrote together in less than 1 this code
here updates and keeps track of the
variables fair and stops if we simply
run this program as usual the computer
would run through all these statements
here one by one quickly and once it gets
to the print line statements it will
display the output over here which is 3
and 15 in this case but the really cool
feature of debugging in IntelliJ allows
you to stop inside the program at any
point and move step by step to do that
the first step is to add something
called a breakpoint by clicking on the
beginning of a line here this will add
this red circle over here meaning that
when we run this program now it would
pose at this line and wait for us to
tell us what to do next once you have a
breakpoint instead of running your
program as usual you would go ahead and
click this bug icon up there this would
run the program in debug mode once you
click it your code would run as normal
and once it sees this breakpoint it
would stop right before it runs this
instruction here in debug mode you can
do things like hover over a variable to
see the value inside it it also usually
appears on the right hand side here once
the variable changes and it also points
out any change in any of the variables
down there now since it's been pausing
at this line here the next thing you can
do is click on this button down there
called step over this allows you to run
this instruction here and move on to the
next one so if we click step over we can
see that our stops variable
will change from 0 to 1 and now our fair
variable is still 0 waiting for this
instruction to happen as well so if we
click another step over that our fair
variable changes from 0 to 5 another
thing you can do is to skip through some
steps by adding another break point
somewhere else in the code and then
instead of stepping through every single
step you could click this resume button
over there that would just jump to the
next breakpoint it finds another really
cool thing you can do in debugging is
this step into I can hear this allows
you to step inside a function while
debugging another function say i have
this multiply function up here we're
inside I call this other function add
which is implemented up there now if I
put a breaking point here and then run
it in debug mode it will pose right
before it caused this add function if I
use the step over icon then it will just
run this ad functional together and then
move on however if I try this step into
it would actually go inside the add
function and show what's happening in
there as well and then if I'm happy with
that and I don't want to go through
every single step in that function I
could just jump to the step out icon
which would return me to the calling
function debugging can be both fun and
challenging at the same time it's what
programmers spend most of their time
doing when their code doesn't work
properly but knowing how to use those
powerful debugging features in IntelliJ
should make debugging any code a lot
easier</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
