simple algorithms for our three problems
that have to go through an exponential
number of solutions to try all possible
assignments of 0 and 12 the vertices and
now I haven't told you yet what this
super powerful computer down here in the
left corner is actually capable of and
the ability that this computer here has
is that it can help us figure out the
best possible zero and one assignment to
the vertices without actually going
through them and the way this computer
can help us is that it has a special
instruction that a normal computer or
even the RAM model does not have and
that instruction is called if better and
I'm going to explain to you in a second
what that means so the if-better
function basically works like a normal
if-else instruction on the RAM so the
normal if-else instruction is if this
part here which I haven't specified yet
is true then this part of the code that
you've written is executed and otherwise
this part down here is executed the
second property is that calling the
if-better function costs as polynomial
time so a normal if else on the RAM just
cause one time step or constant time and
calling this function here will cost
polynomial time and now here comes the
special property of this function
normally when you have an if you would
have to specify some condition here so
that if the condition is satisfied this
part of the code is executed and if it's
not satisfied then this part here is
executed now the if-better is a function
that will figure out by itself if it's
better for us and I'm going to show you
in a minute what I mean by that if it's
better for us to execute this part up
here or this part down here it will
always if you will guess correctly which
part of the code to execute now the
first time you hear this it takes a bit
getting used to so to let me give you
one example for vertex cover how we
could use this powerful function to
solve vertex cover almost trivially</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
