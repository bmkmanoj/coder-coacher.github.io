relationship between the client and the
server possible is this mechanism called
subcontract it's sort of like the real
life analogy of offloading work to a
third party you know you give a
subcontract to somebody to get some work
done that's the same analogy that is
being used here in the structure of the
spring network operating system I
mentioned earlier that the contract
between the client and the server is
established through the idea that is the
interface description language used to
create the contract between the client
and the server and the subcontract is
the interface that is provided for
realizing the ideal contract between the
client and the server so here is the
ideal interface and the client is using
the server's ideal interface to make
invocation calls in the server an
implementation of this ideal interface
is accomplished through the subcontract
mechanism but differently subcontract is
a mechanism to hide the runtime behavior
of an object from the actual interface
for instance there could be a singleton
implementation of the server or it could
be a replicated implementation of the
server but trying does not care and does
not know and all of the detail of how
those clients ideal interfaces are
satisfied is in the details of the
subcontract itself so what that means is
the client side stub generation becomes
very simple because all of the details
of where the server is how to access the
server whether the server is on the same
machine or in a different machine and
there are multiple copies of the server
which copy as a server should I go to
all of those details are in the
subcontract mechanism that makes the
life of client-side stub generation very
very simple so subcontract lives under
the covers of the ideal contract and you
can change the subcontract at any time
so for instance if you don't like the
work being done by one contractor you
give it to a different subcontract same
sort of thing that can happen here is
that the subcontract is something that
you can discover and install add run
so in other words you can dynamically
load new sub contracts for instance if a
singleton server got replicated then you
get a new sub contract that corresponds
to this replicated service so that now
you can access the replicated service
using the subcontract and nothing needs
to change above this line the client
stub doesn't have to do anything
differently all of the details are
handled by this subcontract seamlessly
so in other words you can seamlessly add
functionality to existing services using
the subcontract mechanism</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
