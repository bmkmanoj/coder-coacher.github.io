constructionism constructionism is a
learning theory and probably the most
influential learning theory of the past
century if you've taken a psychology
class you're probably familiar with
constructivism the brainchild of Jean
Piaget that describes how people learn
about the world around them
constructionism is a learning theory
from Seymour Papert
that takes those ideas of constructivism
and applies them to how we should
actually develop curricula or develop
activities to best facilitate student
learning constructionism is really about
putting the learner in the center of the
learning activity and having them
actively construct an understanding of
whatever concept we're trying to teach
them it suggests that we can't just pour
our knowledge into a learner's head but
really they have to build their
understanding of whatever communicating
to them now constructionism is kind of
the umbrella over a lot of different
pedagogies that we'll talk about this in
this class it's the umbrella over
project-based learning problem-based
learning learning by design learning by
example learning by doing all of these
things put the student in the center of
the learning process and have them
construct their understanding of a
concept through some authentic
experience so constructionism is really
about facilitating that active learning
process putting the learner in the
center and having them experience the
concept in an authentic way and
construct their understanding of it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
