we're really interested in this
production
the goal of this course is to get you
ready for scaling and managing
containers in production so let's do
that now that's where deployments come
in see deployments are a declarative way
to say what goes where the Houston for
state is given by the end user
behind-the-scenes deployments use a
cougar nineties concept called replica
set to ensure that the current number of
pods equals the desired number when it
comes to managing pods deployment
distract away the low-level details like
what note is my pot where is it running
pods are tied to the lifetime of a node
so when the note goes away so does the
pot instead of managing that we can use
deployment to make our life a little
easier in the example on screen you'll
see that we have a pod with one replica
well what happens when we change the
number of replicas from 123 our
deployment will go ahead and ensure that
the number of replicas in production
matches are desired state
this means that even if a node goes down
like no.3 just in our example the
deployment will start a new pod and find
somewhere to put it for us and that's
pretty cool
it's time to combine everything we've
learned so far about pods and service
into breaking up the monolith fat and
the smaller services using deployments</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
