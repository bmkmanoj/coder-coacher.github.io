little quiz so let's assume that we have
an algorithm with a running time of 2 to
the power of n times n squared not Oh of
2 to the power of n times n squared but
really 2 to the power of n times n
squared you can add any constant you
want if that makes you happy but that's
not the point of this quiz here and now
we're going to look at an algorithm that
is ten times faster so it has a running
time of 2 to the power of n times n
squared over 10 and if you think about
it finding an algorithm that is 10 times
faster is actually huge and practice so
imagine for example that whenever you
start your computer it would start ten
times faster than it does now a huge
improvement but what I now want to show
you is that such a huge improvement is
virtually useless when you're dealing
with exponential time so assume for
example that for this algorithm here we
have a computer where the maximum input
size that it can handle is 30 what I
would like to know from you now is if we
run this algorithm which is 10 times
faster huge improvement on the same
machine what is the maximum input size
we can handle then and I would like you
to give me your answer here in this box</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
