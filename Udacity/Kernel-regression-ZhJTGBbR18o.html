query is to take the mean of the K where
K is equal to three nearest neighbors
take the mean of their y-value and that
gives us a value somewhere about like
there if we were to repeat this process
at many many points along the x axis
we'd end up with a model that looks like
this what's nice about it is it fits the
data over here where it's curving this
way it fits the data over here where
it's curving that way and it
interpolates nicely and smoothly between
all the data points there are a number
of methods like this that keep the data
around and when they make a query they
consult the data to find the answer the
most famous of these methods is K
nearest neighbor but there are others
such as kernel regression the main way
that KNN differs from kernel regression
is that n kernel regression we weight
the contributions of each of the nearest
data points according to how distant
they are whereas with K and n each data
point that we consider gets essentially
an equal weight we've covered now
parametric models where our goal is to
find parameters like m and B and we toss
the data away and then just use M and B
later to make our queries and here I've
shown you nonparametric or instance
based methods where we keep the data and
we consult it when we make a query</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
