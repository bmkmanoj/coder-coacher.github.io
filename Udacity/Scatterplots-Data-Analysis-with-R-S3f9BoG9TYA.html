from using histograms up to this point
we've looked at distributions of single
variables for example fern count and at
most we looked at different subsets of
friend count by splitting it using a
factor or in our case it was gender now
we're gonna look at two continuous
variables at the same time so to get
started make sure you're in the right
working directory and then go ahead and
load your data set and load the ggplot
library usually it's best to use a
scatter plot to examine the relationship
between two continuous variables Q plot
chooses the scatter plot automatically
when we pass two continuous variables to
the x and y parameters so let's go ahead
and do that I'll pass age to the X
parameter and I'll pass friend count to
the Y parameter and finally undecayed
that my data set is PF my pseudo
Facebook users now there's over ninety
nine thousand observations in our data
so when we create this plot it might
take a few moments to render and there
it is we could also write this code
which will produce the same exact plot
this time I'm not using the X &amp;amp; Y
parameters explicitly and that's okay
because Q plot knows which variables to
use on which axis X will come first and
Y will come second I'll run this code
just so that way you can see the same
plot being produced and there we go we
have a pretty ugly scatter plot but what
are some things that you noticed right
