then you're well on your way towards
understanding how Turing machines
compute and hopefully also are ready to
be convinced that they can compute as
well as any other possible machine
before we move on to that argument
however there's some terminology about
Turing machines and the languages that
they accept and reject and those that
they might loop on that we should set
straight some of the terms may seem
similar but the distinctions are
important ones and we'll use them freely
throughout the rest of the course so pay
close attention first
we define what it means for a machine to
decide a language we say a Turing
machine decides a language L if it
accepts every string in the language and
it rejects every string not in the
language for example the Turing machine
we just described decided the language L
consisting of strings of the form W hash
W where W was a binary string we also
might say that the Turing machine
computed the function that is 1 if X is
in the language and 0 otherwise or even
just that the Turing machine computed
language L</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
