source to a webpage in two important
words and we're gonna use Python to do
it so we're given as input part of a
webpage like this
hello one with some syntax over here on
the left that we'll get to in a bit and
one approach to breaking this up would
be to use pythons string dot find
function to find this space and then
split up the string into everything to
the right of the space and everything to
the left of the space you may already be
familiar with Python string dot find
function from previous experience with
computer science but if you're not it's
often described as finding a needle in a
haystack
for example let's say that I want to
find the fun in Mifune oh oh this
is our needle and we're going to look
for the first copy of it we can find
over here in the haystack string on the
left and there is some fun hidden in
there and the answer we get back will be
the string index of the beginning of the
fun which for us is two you may be
wondering why this is two and not some
other value like say seven remember that
Python strings and in fact almost all
Python collections start counting at
zero so the M is at position zero the I
is at position one the F is at position
two and that's where the fun starts
until should owe me foon a as a Japanese
actor one of his most famous roles is
the Bandit in Rashomon well we found the
fun
so snap the rest of the jobs a game
let's see a few more examples of this we
want to find a space in hello world and
there's one right here position zero one
two three four five so our final answer
is five you can also give find a
starting position so here if we're
trying to find one in one plus one
equals two the first occurrence can be
found at position zero but if we only
start around position two then the
answer we get will be four and if the
needle you're looking for doesn't occur
in your big bass string Python returns
negative one which is out of range for
the string to indicate as much so let's
review and test your knowledge of string
dot find with a quiz and in this class
quizzes are for your benefit
they check your understanding they don't
count for your grade in any way they are
not meant to be stressful and you can
try them as many times as you like until
you get the right answer so here I've
written two Python expressions ada
lovelace dot find space let's say we're
trying to break this up into words and
alan turing dot find n starting at four
and i'd like you to fill in each blank
with the answer we would get from the
python interpreter and you can use
Python if you'd like to get a better
feel for how this is going to turn out
but you can also just try to solve it on
your own by thinking hard about the
structure of the problem</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
