abstractions yourself but let's walk
through and think about all the
abstractions that sit between the
electrons and holes and applications at
the top we already talked about the
transistor we know at the lowest level
of the hierarchy the movement of the
electrons and the holes are governed by
the laws of physics and as I mentioned
earlier transistor reigns in
the randomness in the movement of
electrons and holes and gives us an
abstraction of a switching device which
is the transistor using the switching
device which is a transistor we can
implement the next level up in the
hierarchy which are logic gates and here
is where the and gates and the or gates
and large gates come in where we are
implementing boolean logic using
transistor as a switching device
sequential and combinational logic
elements are implemented using logic
gates such as and not and or logic
elements sequential and combinational
logic elements are then organized into a
data path depending on what hardware
circuitry of functionality we want to
implement the data path establishes the
communication paths we need between
these combinational and sequential logic
elements to realize whatever is the
hardware device that we are trying to
design and the control part of it is a
finite state machine that controls the
data path and implements the repertoire
of the hardware device that we are
trying to realize and for instance if
the intent is to implement a processor
then the instructions in the processor
have to be implemented using the data
path and controlled by the control logic
next level up in this hierarchy is the
instruction set architecture this is the
abstraction that is defined by a
processor when you hear the promo
commercial for instance that says Intel
Inside
right it is the eye assay or the
instruction set architecture that is
being talked about by the promo buried
within this term is a or the abstraction
is a is all the details of how the ISA
is actually implemented by the data path
and the control logic now we come to
software sitting on top of the
instruction set architecture is a system
software operating systems compilers
runtime systems and so on that exercise
the instructions provided by the
processor architecture finally we have
apps on top this is where applications
like Google Earth come in
notice that the abstraction that is used
by the applications themselves is the
high-level language in which these
applications are written the system
software components such as the compiler
translate the high-level language used
in writing these applications into the
instructions that can be executed on the
processor similarly the operating system
provides interface for the applications
to request services of the operating
system for instance to access specific
devices during the execution of the
application or for getting resources
such as memory on demand those are the
functions provided by the operating
system is an abstraction
thus the instruction set is the meeting
point between software and hardware it
serves as the abstraction needed by the
system software for example the compiler
to generate the code that corresponds to
the high-level language constructs that
are being used in coding up an
application the software whether it is
at the system software level or at the
application level does not care and does
not know how this instruction set may
actually be implemented down below
meaning the implementation of the
instruction set itself in
terms of data path and control the
sequential logic elements that sit below
that are the logic gates of the
transistor or finally the electrons and
they don't care what programs are
running on top of the processor so the
instruction set architecture is the
meeting point between software and
hardware the hardware implementation
simply fulfils the contract of realizing
the instruction set architecture of the
processor operating system is the
abstraction level we will be focusing on
in this course which is a course on
advanced operating systems you will have
the opportunity to learn about other
levels in this hierarchy from other
courses that are offered through this
