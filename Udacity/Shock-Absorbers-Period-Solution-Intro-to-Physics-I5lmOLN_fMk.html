need to first make a key observation
imagine that we have a block here that's
suspended by four springs and we know
that in order to calculate the net force
on this block we have to add up all of
the forces contributed by each of these
Springs which is just going to be four
times the contribution of one spring but
it also turns out that we can actually
imagine all four of these Springs being
replaced by just one single spring with
a spring constant of 4k so it turns out
that Springs when put in parallel like
this you can just add up their spring
constants and treat it as one common
spring which is a pretty nifty trick so
now that we know this fact we can
actually just imagine all four of these
Springs on the bottom of the car as just
being one big spring with spring
constant 4k and now we're ready to solve
for the period of oscillation so we
learned in the unit that the period of
Springs oscillation is equal to two pi
times the square root of the mass of the
thing oscillating over the spring
constant K in this problem however this
K is actually not the same as this K
since this equation only applies to a
block on one spring we can immediately
apply it to a block on four springs but
as we just argued these four springs are
actually equivalent to one spring with a
spring constant of 4k so we can actually
replace this K with 4k and now we can
use this equation and plugging in our
numbers here we find that the period of
the oscillation of the car on the
springs is equal to 0.4 four seconds</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
