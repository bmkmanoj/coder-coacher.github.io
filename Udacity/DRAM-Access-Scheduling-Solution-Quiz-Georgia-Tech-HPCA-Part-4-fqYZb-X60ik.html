access scheduling quiz so we have 32
arrays each is 16 megabits and takes a
12 bit raw address and a 12 bit column
address 12 bits is 3 hex digits so the
raw address will be the upper 3 hex
digits and the column address will be
the lower hex digits each of these
corresponds to a 32-bit memory location
so what happens is each of these arrays
sees the same address but it provides a
different bit for that address so each
address will have the same sequence of
row and column addresses is just that
they will implement different bits of
that address so what we have here is the
first one of course needs to be a page
open so we have 10 nanoseconds to open
this first page we will then read in 2
nanoseconds then we will close the page
in another 5 nanoseconds because the
next one is on a different page the row
address is different so we spent 17
nanoseconds here we will spend another
17 here we will then spend another 17
here because it's again a different row
17 here and here and here and here
overall we have 7 accesses each to a
different page so each of them requires
17 nanoseconds for a total of 119
nanoseconds now let's try to reorganize
this what we want to do when we
reorganize these is once we open a page
access everything on that page before we
move on which means we will open this
row and then we will access everything
in that row which means this and this
too now what happens is we spent 10
nanoseconds opening that row 3 times 2
nanoseconds reading these three things
and then we need to close the row in
another 5 nanoseconds then what happens
is we open the next row
and we read everything from that row
which includes this too so we end up
opening one row reading two things from
it and then closing it and now we spend
70 nanoseconds for each one of these in
total we spent 74 nanoseconds doing
these accesses so as you can see when
caches have a number of pending misses
and we need to send this message to
memory
it pays to rearrange the order of the
addresses we are accessing to benefit
from the organization of the DRAM</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
