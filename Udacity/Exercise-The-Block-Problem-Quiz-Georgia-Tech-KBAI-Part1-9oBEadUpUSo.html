analysis let us look at this blocks
world problem this is a very famous
problem in AI it has occurred again and
again and almost every textbook in AI
has this problem you're given a table on
which there are three blocks and a is on
table B is on table and C's only this is
the initial State and you want to move
these blocks to the goal State on this
configuration so that season table B's
on C is and B the problem looks very
simple isn't it
let's introduce a couple of constraints
you may move only one block at a time
so you can't pick both a and B together
and second you may only move a block
that is nothing on top of it so you
cannot move block a in this
configuration because it is C on top of
it let us also suppose that we given
some operators in this world these
operators essentially move some object
to some location for example we could
move C to the table or C on to B or C on
to a not all the operators may be
applicable in the current state C
already is on a but in principle all
this all of these operators are
available given these operators and this
initial State and this goal State write
a sequence of operations that will move
the blocks from the initial state to the
goal State</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
