certificate when we look at learning
today is a cake packaging where people
go to school for four more years to get
a degree
really density give our graduates the
absolute latest skills learning and he
answered got it in my mind I'm comparing
the nanodegree to a graduate degree I do
think a nano degree it's more beneficial
in a lot of cases than a traditional
degree being able to empower people
around the world to live up to their
full potential is to be country when I
was working at fast food I didn't feel
challenged and that's me was exactly
over I learned about Udacity when I was
still a concern first I just started
looking for colleges when I was finding
that it was just very expensive and
time-consuming they can get you up to
speed very quickly and give you the
actual skill sets that you need we've
been very fortunate to work with tech
giants like Google and Amazon many
others to develop this recommend the way
we create courses and nanodegrees
together with Udacity is a great
teamwork you're building effectively a
great portfolio of projects the
self-driving car engineering program had
never been done before so it was really
interesting to me because it was in the
field that I was working and I wanted to
get a nano degree in front-end
development because of my by mentioning
art and newly found interest in
programming we unleash the true power
education to the entire world I firmly
believe we can double the world's GDP
Udacity has supported me from beginning
to end they've worked with me on my
resume my LinkedIn profile interview
proffering project reviews they were the
ones that helps me get this job
ultimately it's like a dream
