to populations all over the world often
includes understanding allelic
distribution remember unlike a disease
that spreads laterally from person to
person alleles are spread across
generations from parents to offspring to
offspring to offspring of course this is
an inherently slower process and it
changes depending on reproductive habits
of various populations we learned a bit
about this in less than six when we
discussed natural selection and genetic
drift playing a role take this map for
the allele of lactase persistence now
may be a little hard to see here but we
have an outline of Africa Europe Asia
Oceania and the some of the Pacific
Islands we also have an inset here of
Central America and South America now
each circle represents a snapshot
currently of the prevalence of the t
allele or the C allele remember the t
allele correlates with lactase
persistence and the celiac or lakes with
lactase non persistence and you can see
just looking at this map each circle
from each spot represents the prevalence
of that allele in that region in that
given population so although allelic
frequencies and distributions can change
over time we can get individual
snapshots in any given moment and in
this particular moment you can look at
this map and see the regions where
lactase persistence would be prevalent
based on the prevalence of the t allele
and where lactase non persistence would
be prevalent based on the prevalence of
the celio or the darkened region of the
circle now selection pressures and milk
drinking populations really only maybe
5,000 years ago have resulted in the
rapid spread of this allele throughout
the world the t allele so if i tell you
that i am lactase persistent which
regions of the world would you assume
that i do not share ancestry now there
are multiple answers to this question so
make sure you check any and all that
apply and if you're absolutely terrible
with geography I've actually labeled the
different regions or answers here in the
map for you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
