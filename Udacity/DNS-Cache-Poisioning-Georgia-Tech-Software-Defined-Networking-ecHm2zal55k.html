denial of service attacks and defenses
we'll talk about what denial of service
attacks are various defenses we'll talk
about how to infer denial of service
activity and we'll talk about how to
secure networks against denial of
service attacks using Software Defined
Networking so what is denial of service
denial of service is simply an attack
that attempts to exhaust various
resources one resource that a denial of
service attack might exhaust is network
bandwidth another is TCP connections for
example a host might have only a limited
number of TCP connections that that it
can open to various clients or the
denial of service attack might attempt
to exhaust various server resources for
example this victim might be a web
server running complicated scripts to
render web pages and if the web server
suddenly becomes the target of a bunch
of bogus requests the server could spend
a lot of resources rendering pages for
requests that are not legitimate before
2000 needs denial of service attacks
were typically single-source after 2000
with the rise of internet worms as we
saw in an earlier lesson these attacks
could become distributed effectively
being launched from many attackers let's
talk about three different types of
defenses against denial of service
attacks first we have something called
ingress filtering then we have something
called you RPF or reverse path filtering
checks and then in the case of an attack
on TCP connection resources we can use
something called TCP syn cookies to
defend against denial of service let's
suppose that we have a stub autonomous
system whose IP prefix was 204 dot 69
that to of 7.0 slash 24 now this is a
stub network that has no other networks
connected to it and this is the only IP
address space that this network owns
then the router that is immediately
upstream of that internet service
provider can simply drop all traffic for
which the source IP address is not in
the IP address range of that particular
network so this is foolproof and it
works at the edges of the internet where
it's very easy to determine the IP
address range that's owned by a
downstream stub autonomous system
unfortunately it doesn't work well in
the core where a particular router might
have a lot of difficulty determining
whether packets from a particular source
IP address could be allowed on a
particular incoming interface so the
solution that operators try to use in
the core is to use the routing tables to
determine whether a packet could
feasibly arrive on a particular incoming
interface so if a router had a routing
table that said all packets 410 that
0.10 / 24 should be sent via interface 1
and all packets destined for 10.0 dot
dot 0 / 24 should be sent by interface 2
then you RPF says if we see a packet 4
with a particular source IP address on
an incoming interface that is different
than where we would have sent the packet
in the reverse direction then we should
go ahead and drop this packet so the
benefits of you RPF is that is automatic
but the drawbacks are that it requires
symmetric routing and we know from
earlier lessons that routing in the
Internet is often asymmetric therefore
in any situation where asymmetric
routing is a possibility it is not
possible or reasonable to use.you RPF so
we've talked about ingress filtering and
you RPF checks and let's now talk about
the use of SIM cookies to defend against
tcp-based denial of service attacks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
