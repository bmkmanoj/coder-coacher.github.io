of restaurants and have various kind of
meals and sometimes I get an allergic
reaction I do not understand why I'm
getting this allergic reaction under
what conditions to Arkady allergic
reactions so go to an air agent and say
dear air agent tell me under what
conditions do I get allergic reaction
and I give all the data shown in this
table to the air agent note that there
are only five examples here like we
mentioned in knowledge-based AI we want
to do learning based on a small number
of examples because that's how humans to
learning note also that the first
example is positive and that they are
both positive and negative examples that
is important so that we can construct
both specializations and generalizations
how then may an AI agent decide the
conditions under which I get allergic
reaction so these examples are coming
one at a time and let us see what
happens when the first example comes
here is the first example the restaurant
was Sam's meal was breakfast day was
friday the cost was cheap so from this
one example I can construct both a very
specific model which is exactly this
example Sam's breakfast friday cheap you
can't have anything more specific than
this and the agent can also construct
the most journal model which of course
is that it can be any restaurant any
meal any day and so on you can't
construct emotional model than this so
the most specialized model based on this
one example says that I'm allergic when
I go to sams and a breakfast on Fridays
and the cost is cheap and the most
general model says I'm allergic to
everything no matter where I go what
meal I have on what day what it cost is
I feel a tragic</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
