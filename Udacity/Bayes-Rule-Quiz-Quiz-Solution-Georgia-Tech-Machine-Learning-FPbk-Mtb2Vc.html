have spleentitis yes does he have Swing
Titus I don't think we know for sure
mm-hmm
what do you mean by that well I mean
it's a noisy and probabilistic world
right so the test told us that things
look like he has spleentitis and the
test is usually right but the test is
sometimes wrong and it can give the
wrong answer and that's really all we
know so we can't be sure okay but if you
had the pick one if you had the pick yes
or no like our students did when they
took the quiz which one would you think
yes or no so I guess seat-of-the-pants I
would just say yes because the test says
yes but if I guess I was trying to be
more precise I may go through and work
out the probability and I guess if it's
more likely to have than not to have
then I'd say yes and otherwise I'd say
no okay so how would you go about doing
that what we through it based on the
name of the quiz I think I'd go with
Bayes rule okay so I like that so Bayes
rule is everyone recall is the
probability that hypothesis given the
data is equal to the probability that
data given the hypothesis times the
probability of that papas is divided by
the probability of the data so let's
write all that out so what is the
probability of spleentitis which I'm
just gonna write as an S yeah we're
making jokes about spleentitis but we
don't want that to be confused with
splen itis which is a real thing and I'm
probably not very pleasant so apologies
to anyone out there was split night is
but this is bling titus which is really
totally different is one that is a real
thing
yeah enlargement and inflammation to the
spleen and and spleen as a result of
infection or possibly a parasite
infestation or cysts so what you're
saying is that's gross and we don't want
to think about it okay good okay so okay
so the probability of getting splits
which again is a very rare thing and
probably isn't even really it's totally
different it's definitely not really
it's definitely not given that we've
gotten a positive result and you say we
should use Bayes rule so that would be
in this case what so it's the same as
the probability of the positive result
given that you have spleentitis
time's the probability the prior
probability of having spleentitis mm-hmm
and I want to say normalized but like
divided by the probability of a positive
test result and what would be the
problem the other option is that you
don't have spleentitis even though you
got a positive result and that would be
equal to the probability of a positive
result given that you don't have
spleentitis mm-hmm
times the prior probability of not
having spleentitis mm-hmm divided by the
again the same thing the probability of
the test result so that's those two
things added together need to be one
right but as you point out if we just
want to figure out which one is bigger
than the other we don't actually have to
know this good point so we can ignore it
okay so let's compute this so what is in
fact the probability of me getting a
plus given that I have spleentitis
all right so it says in the set up the
test results correct positive 98% of the
time so I think that's what it means I
think it means that if you really do
have it it's gonna say that you have it
with that probability okay so that's
just point nine eight okay and that's
times the prior probability of having
spleentitis which is 0.08 0.08 and
what's that equal to it is equal to
point zero zero seven eight point zero
zero seven eight four okay fine we can
do the same thing over here so what's
the probability of getting a positive if
you don't have spleentitis so the
probability of a correct negative is
ninety seven percent that means if you
really don't have it it's going to say
you don't have it so probability of
positive result given that you don't
have it that should be the three percent
that's exactly right times the prior
probability of not having spleentitis
which is point nine nine to one minus
0.08 that's right and that is equal to
0.02 nine seven six so which number is
bigger the one that has the larger
significant digit which one of those two
is that I mean obviously the one that's
bigger is the
don't you don't have it that's right so
the answer would be no and in fact the
probability is almost 80% yeah which is
crazy so it's like you go into the
doctor you've run a test
the doctor says congratulations you
don't have spleentitis because the test
says you do that's right so what did
that tell you stupid that does seem
stupid but what does it tell you about
Bayes rule
what is Bayes rule capturing what is the
thing that makes the answer no despite
the fact you have a high reliability
test that says yes okay so I guess I
guess the way to think about it is a
random person showing up in the doctor's
office is very unlikely to have this
particular disease and even the tiny
little small percentage probability that
the test would give a wrong answer is
completely swamped by the fact that you
probably don't have the disease but I
guess this isn't really factoring in the
idea that you know presumably this lab
test was run for some other reason there
was some other evidence that there was
concern or the doctors just really
wanted some more money because she needs
a new boat yeah I know a lot of doctors
I do too most of them don't work like
that most well most of them have PhD is
not even DS so another way of
summarizing what you just said Michael I
think is that priors matter I want to
say be thinking I got out of this as
tests don't matter
well like what's the purpose of running
a test if if it's going to come back and
say well it used to be that I was pretty
sure you didn't have it and now I'm
still pretty sure you don't have it well
the point of running a test is you run a
test when you have a reason to believe
that the test might be useful so if what
is the one thing if I could only change
one thing without getting completely
ridiculous what's the easy way I don't
know what's easy yeah what's the easiest
thing for me to change about this setup
I have three numbers here this one this
one and this one what would be the
easiest number to change well in some
sense none of them seem that easy to
change but I guess maybe what you're
trying to get me to say is that if we
look at a different population of people
then we can change that point 0:08
number to something else like if we only
give the test to people who have other
signs of splint itis then then it'll
probably be a much bigger number right
so changing the test making a test
better might be hard presumably you know
billions of dollars of research has gone
into that but if you don't give the test
to people who you don't have any reason
to believe
have spleentitis just walking off the
street as you put it a random person
walking off the street then you can
change the prior so some other evidence
that you might have spleentitis would
lead the prior to change and then the
test would suddenly be useful so this by
the way is an argument for why you don't
want to just require that everyone take
tests for certain things because if the
prior probability is low then the test
isn't very useful on the other hand as
soon as you have any reason to believe
or you have strong evidence that someone
might have some condition then it makes
sense to test them for it because it's
like a stop and frisk situation it's
exactly like a stop infer situation I'm
looking at you Mayor Bloomberg okay
but it's some sense you're used to the
word prior is a little confusing there
so it's not it's not that we're changing
the prior right it's it's that we're we
have some additional evidence that we
can factor in and I guess we can imagine
that that's part of the prior but it's
it seems like it's a posterior yeah it
does and but one way to think about it
it was actually I think you captured in
what you just said right which is you
can think of as a prior well prior to
what so it's your prior belief over a
set of hypotheses given the world that
you happen to be in if you're in a world
where random people walk in to take a
test for spleentitis then there's a low
prior probability that they have it if
you're in a world where the only people
who come in or people who are from a
population where the prior probability
is significantly higher then you would
have a different prior it's really a
question about where you are in the
process when you actually formulate your
question so would it be worth asking
people how how likely would it have to
be that you have spleentitis to make
this test at all useful right that would
change the positive positive result
would actually change your mind about
whether someone has it yeah actually
that I think that's something that I'll
leave for the for the interested reader
where would that prior probability have
to change though that getting a positive
result I would be more likely to believe
that you actually have it than not that
does bring up a philosophical question
though which is so what just because the
priors have changed doesn't mean that
suddenly the test is useful or that the
test is going to give you an answer that
somehow distinguishes and is dispositive
but from a mathematical point of view
the question of whether this number is
0.08 or 0.8 you know eight tenths of a
percent where does it change as a change
it
five percent or does it change of 50
percent or does it change at five
hundred percent they probably changes at
five hundred percent you know what
where's the place in which suddenly a
positive result would make you believe
that they actually had splint eyes or
whatever disease you're looking for okay
