compute H but loop until we get the most
popular H how do we start well select
for feature points at random compute the
homography between all of them exactly
but then start looking for the sum of
squared differences between the in lire
for the new one and basically the one
that is computed with respect to some
threshold keep the largest set of n
liars and then recompute the H estimate
within all of the in liars
and the basic idea here is that there
are more in Liars than outliers well
that doesn't really help the idea really
is is which outliers are wrong from the
a set that is actually much more correct
so giving more consensus or more power
more popularity to the ones that
actually are matching each other is what
the key here is not that there are a
number of samples more there could be a
lot of samples but it's going to go
choose the one that are actually more
similar to each other and that would be
the one that we want to look for</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
