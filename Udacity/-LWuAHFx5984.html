systems of equations that had a unique
solution however as we've seen it's not
always the case that there is a unique
solution to every system we need the
Gaussian elimination procedure to be
robust against these cases
let's look at the following system x
plus 2y plus 3z equals 13 x + 2 y plus Z
equals 0 7 x plus 6y plus 5z equals to
$OPERAND we can start solving the system
as usual clearing the terms beneath the
top xterm subtract three times the first
equation from the second to get negative
4y minus 8 z equals negative 3 and then
subtract 7 times the first equation from
the third to get negative 8y minus 16 z
equals negative 5 then we drop down to
the second equation and start to clear
the y terms beneath negative 4y subtract
two x the second equation from the third
and now we're in a very interesting
situation there is nothing remaining on
the left-hand side of the third equation
but there is a one remaining on the
right-hand side giving us the equation 0
equals 1
what does this mean well the original
system of equations assumes that there
are numbers x y and z which satisfy the
three simultaneously since we used legal
operations on the original system and
obtained a false statement it means that
these supposed numbers x y&amp;amp;z which
satisfy the system must not exist in
other words this contradiction tells us
that the system is inconsistent it has
no solutions in fact if we ever run into
the case that the left-hand side of an
equation is 0 and the right-hand side is
not 0 we can immediately stop and say
that the system has no solutions
this is a nice criterion for finding
systems with no solutions but what about
systems with more than one solution this
is a bit trickier let's modify the
system from before just a little bit
making the constant term in the third
equation one instead of two again we
start by subtracting 3
three times the first equation from the
second and continued by subtracting 7
times the first equation from the third
the third equation now reads negative 8y
minus 16 z equals negative 6 now as
before subtract two x the second
equation from the third unlike last time
the bottom equation is not a
contradiction certainly 0 equals 0 so
what are we to make of this
well since 0 always equals 0 regardless
of what x y&amp;amp;z are the last equation
becomes redundant the system would have
the exact same solution if we dropped it
all together
this is how to interpret an equation of
the form 0 equals 0 the road occupies
was originally a redundant equation it
gives no extra information about the
solutions that was not contained in the
equations above it
in fact notice that in the original
system if we added the first equation 22
times the second equation we would get
the third equation so what do we do now
the system essentially has only two
planes in it meaning that the solution
cannot be a single point since the
planes are parallel the solutions that
will be a line in fact is there anything
else we can do
yes like we did with lines earlier we
can parameterize the solution set in
other words we can describe all the
points in the solution set as a function
of some number of parameters
how can we do this first after dropping
the 0 equals 0 equation notice that we
cannot clear terms downward anymore
instead what we will do is identify what
are called pivot variables these are
variables whose values will be
determined by the values of the non
pivot or free variables the pivot
variables are the variables which are
leading terms in our equations in this
case x and y are leading terms so they
are the pivot variables since Z is not a
leading term in any of the equations it
will be a free variable since he is a
free variable it will become a parameter
in our parameterization of the solution
set now let's continue our Gaussian
elimination algorithm so we can end up
with the parametrization of the solution
set of our system in the second equation
in order to make the pivot variable have
a coefficient equal 1 multiplied through
by negative one-fourth the equation now
reads y plus 2z equals three fourths
then like we normally do in gaussian
elimination we will clear the terms
above the leading y term so we subtract
two x the second equation from the first
this gives us x minus Z equals negative
one-half in the first equation since the
leading coefficient of each equation is
now one and the leading variables only
appear in one equation each we have
simplified the system as much as
possible
this form is called reduced row echelon
form or rref for short
we can now parameterize the solution set
in the following way
suppose XYZ is a point in the solution
set then X will have to equal negative
one-half plus Z by rearranging this top
equation
similarly by rearranging the second
equation we see that Y has to equal
three fourths minus two x z finally
since Z is a free variable we set it
equal to itself
this means that for every real value of
Z this point is in the solution set
another way we can write this is to
split the vector into a sum of a
constant vector and a vector with the Z
term this form should be familiar it is
how we parameterize the line previously
except now we're using z instead of tea
for the parameter name the base point of
this parameterization is negative
one-half three-fourths 0 and the
direction vector this parameterization
is one negative 21
here are some different points that are
in the solution set that we can generate
by picking different values of Z picking
Z equals 0 gives us the base .
regardless of the value of z that is
picked we can check that the point will
be a solution to the original system of
equations</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
