connectivity is a bad experience low
connectivity is well maddening and
previously there was nothing you could
do about it
all you could do is make a request and
then it's entirely out of your hands it
might work it might not it might be fast
it might not you have zero control until
the request succeeds if it even succeeds
well that story changes with a
relatively new browser feature called
service worker and that wait Jake what
was that it was was what what this is
the feature that solves everything the
feature that gives developers new powers
over the network you could at least
introduce it a bit better than that
how do you mean well for too long
users have been left staring at a white
screen
for too long they've been let down by
the cruel seas of network connectivity
and for too long we've been powerless to
help
we've been left
waiting
but no longer a new browser feature has
arrived
a total game change
what feature lets you control the
network
rather than letting the network control
you
who is this new feature
what promises
introducing
the serviceworker
yeah yeah okay that was pretty good
I'm British you see I'm physically
incapable of positivity and excitements
well I still like you
Britishness and all well thank you and
listen if that wasn't compelling enough
for you to stick with us for the next
lesson I don't know what is so strap in
and click through to the next lesson
let's drag the web into the world of
offline first yeah what he said let's do
