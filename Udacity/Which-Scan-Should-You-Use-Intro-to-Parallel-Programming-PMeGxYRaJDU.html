and figure out what the right choice
would be so for the first we're looking
at a small input vector and you've got
plenty of processors so you're not
really worried so much about work
efficiency if you have more than enough
processors to do the work that you need
to do thus you're probably going to be
concerned with the step efficiency of
the algorithm that you pick and the one
with the greatest step efficiency is
hillis and steele now conversely when
you have an enormous amount of work to
do and not nearly enough processors to
do it you're going to be looking for the
algorithm that is going to have the best
work complexity and so for this if you
have parallel processors you're
absolutely going to want to run the work
efficient algorithm flex algorithm now
if you only have one processor to work
with you're stuck with a serial
algorithm no matter what</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
