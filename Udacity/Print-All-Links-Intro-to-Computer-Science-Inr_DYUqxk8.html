target procedure and it will return none
as the first output if there's no next
target otherwise it will return the URL
and the end quote and now all we have to
do is figure out how to keep going so
let's look at what we were doing before
we turn these four lines in there
procedure so now we can instead of
having all this code we're going to call
the get next target and assign the
results so now we've got the value of
URL which we do on a printout so we're
still going to print that out as before
and we still want to update the value of
page but we don't use end quote now what
we want to use is the value that was
returned here which we assigned to the
variable end pause and then what we're
doing it all again right so all the code
here is just another call to get next
target and similarly this would be n
paws instead of end quote and we want to
keep going until we get to the end so
how do we decide when we got to the end
well we got to the end when the URL
that's returned is none and when the
call to get next target returns known
for the URL we know we're done
so we've seen a way to keep going that's
a while loop we've seen a way to do a
test we want to test the URL and we have
everything we need now to print all the
links on the page so I'm going to give
you a start for how to write this
procedure and then you're gonna finish
it so we're going to do is define a
procedure that will print all the links
on the page and it takes the page as
input and so we want to use a while loop
to keep going and I am gonna leave blank
the test condition for the while loop
we'll leave that as something for you to
figure out in the body of the while loop
well we're gonna call get next target
assigning URL and end pause to the
result this is just like what we are
doing in the example code now what we
need to do is check whether we got a
valid URL so what we were doing here we
assumed that we always got a valid URL
and we printed it out and we kept going
but we need to do something to test
whether the URL that we got back is none
so that's what we'll do
so we're gonna have if URL and if that's
true that means we found a valid URL we
didn't get the value none as the result
from getting next target and so we want
to print that out as we were doing
before will print the URL and we'll
advance the page to the next position if
we didn't get a valid URL well that
means that get next target did not find
a link there were no more links in the
page and we need to do something else
and I will leave blank what we need to
do here so this is all we need for the
code for pronoun links there are two
parts left for you to do as the quiz
here see if you can figure out what you
go as the test condition for the while
and in the block for the else and if
that's correct you'll be able to print
all the links on the page</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
