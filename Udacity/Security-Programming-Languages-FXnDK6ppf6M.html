computer security a topic we really
haven't touched on much in this unit so
far security can sometimes be defined as
computing in the presence of an
adversary someone else using a computer
or network or resources who means you
harm or hopes to exploit or take
advantage of resources that you've put
out there it just so happens you will be
surprised to discover I am breaking this
news that the Internet is not secure
malicious agents are adversaries can
write malicious webpages or JavaScript
fragments the simplest way to do this
would be to write a JavaScript fragment
that loops forever mmm some sort of
version of Fibonacci that has no
stopping condition that just keeps going
and going and going then as soon as you
directed your browser to that page it
would stall and you'd be denied some
service you wouldn't be able to use your
computer in practice browsers often put
some sort of timeout on script execution
I'll run your script for three or four
seconds and after that if it hasn't
finished I better stop that's one of the
reasons why optimization is so important
but it also has this security angle if
we make any mistakes when we're
designing our web browser then outside
agents might break in to our computers
and gain access to sensitive documents
our tax returns our personal email or
whatnot we want to make sure that that
doesn't happen let's listen to someone
who knows quite a bit more about
security than I do talk about how this
plays out in the real world with web
browsers the web can be a great place
but it can also be a dangerous place
nothing stops users from posting
malicious code or websites or writing
scripts that will try to take advantage
of your computer or your browser there
might be security holes or exploits
they're sometimes called that allow this
I was wondering if you might talk a bit
about security at the language or
implementation level from the
perspective of Mozilla yeah absolutely
security is a prevalent concern at
Mozilla when I was growing up the idea
of getting a piece of software was that
you actually drove to a store and you
looked at a shelf and you pulled a box
off the shelf and you paid somebody and
you took it home and that that piece of
software was sold to you by a company
that you trusted by a third party that
you trusted so you had some some sense
of this piece of software that I'm about
to put on my computer is
something that I can believe is going to
do something on my behalf not something
against me the web doesn't work that way
at all the way web applications work is
you can go to any website anywhere in
the world and somebody you've never met
never seen and that nobody can vouch for
for you is going to run some of their
code that they wrote on your computer so
that's sort of that changes the game
that means that in order to build a
serious platform where programs can do
important things on your behalf we need
to make sure that they can't also do
important things against you and the
more people put valuable parts of their
lives onto the web like their bank
account for example the more we have
important assets to defend one of the
concepts people talk about a lot in
security is the notion of the trusted
computing base so when you download some
code from some third party that you
don't know if we're being kind of
maximally pessimistic we say well I
don't trust this code completely I'd
like it to do something for me but I
don't know for sure that it's not
malicious however that code is running
inside of a web browser like Firefox and
I do trust the code that was written by
Mozilla I do trust Firefox and in order
to be able to say as much as we can
about the security of a system
we'd like for the parts of the system
that we need to trust the most to be as
small as possible so we talk about
shrinking the trusted computing base as
being a goal of having the smallest
possible amount of software where if it
goes wrong a disaster can ensue like
somebody could steal your credit card
information or your bank account so all
modern web browsers are implemented in
C++
now C++ is a very powerful language
there's a lot of things that you can do
with it but it's also not a particularly
safe language it's a language where if
you make one wrong move if you make one
little programming mistake you can
actually leave parts of your system open
to malicious programs so for example if
you write a program in C++ and you
forget to make sure that you have an
array of data and you forget to make
sure that the program doesn't go beyond
the end of the
arrey in most programming languages
you'll get a runtime error that says
oops you tried to access beyond the end
of the array C++ doesn't give you that
protection what C++ does is it just
keeps reading whatever happens to be in
memory at the end of that array well
whatever happens to be in memory could
actually be some part of of the browser
that has internal information like a
password it could also be some other
program running on the system and
there's a lot of people out there who
work on finding ways to exploit these
kinds of bugs to use them to take
control of your computer or to get
access to your private data so the
project of building a web browser that
people can trust and building a web
browser that operates on user's behalf
is also one of building software that
they can trust and in order to build
software that they can trust it needs to
be built on top of programming
technologies that we know we can work
with effectively to build software
that's not sick that's not unsafe so
we've been discussing malicious code
like java script written by evildoers
that we would run in our interpreter
running evil code seems really bad can't
I just look at the source code and tell
if it's bad before I run it and then not
run the bad code
why doesn't those it would do something
like that unfortunately it turns out
that there's a lot of good theoretical
computer science that shows us that that
is a provably impossible problem so I
don't know if you've discussed the
halting problem we may have it turns out
that if I were able to prove that any
particular piece of code was not
malicious I would also be able to solve
the halting problem and we already know
that that's an unsolvable problem in
computer science looking at this maybe
from a more positive side as that means
that I'll always have a job the law of
compiler writer employability exactly
