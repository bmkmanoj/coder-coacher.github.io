the client call just transferring the
arguments from the client to the
server's domain that was the original
cost and the four copies were first
creating an RPC packet copying there are
people RPC packet into the kernel buffer
copying the kernel buffer out into the
server domain and then the server domain
the server stub getting into action
taking this information that has been
passed up to it by the kernel and
putting it on the server stack to start
executing the server code so this was
the original cost that we incurred in
terms of copy now life is much simpler
all that is happening is on the client
side the client stub is copying the
parameters into the haystack and I want
to emphasize the word copying the
parameters that is very different from
what was happening over here here the
client stuff was doing a lot more work
it actually had to serialize the data
structures that are being passed as as
actual arguments into a sequence of
bytes in this RPC message whereas here
it is simply copying it because the
client and the server know exactly what
the semantics and syntax of the
arguments that are being passed back and
forth and therefore there is no need to
serialize the data structure it just has
to create a copy of the parameters into
the a stack and this a stack is of
course shared between the client and the
server so what the server stub is going
to do is basically going to take the
arguments that are now sitting in the a
stack and copy it into the east stack
remember the execution stack provided by
the kernel for executing the server
procedure that is the special service
stack that you're going to use so the
arguments are copied by the server stub
into the east tack and once it is done
the server procedure is now ready to be
executed in the server domain so what
we've accomplished is that the entire
client-server interaction requires only
two copies one for copying the arguments
from the client stack into the a stack
which is usually called the marshaling
of the arguments
and the second copy is taking the
a-stack arguments that are sitting in
the a stack and copying it into the
server's stack that is the unmarshal
so these are the two copies involved one
on the client side and one on the server
side and both these copies are happening
above the kernel it's in the user space
right it is in the space of the client
that the client stub is making this copy
of the arguments into the a stack and
similarly it is in the space of the
server domain that the unmarshal is is
happening and of course this is the work
done so we basically taken the original
four copies and gotten rid of the two
copies that were being done inside the
kernel one into the kernel and one out
of the kernel these two copies which is
done by the kernel we got rid of them
and instead we have only two copies this
copies even though you're calling it
copies it is it is it is really not as
tedious as
creating an RPC message it is it is a
more efficient way of creating the
information that needs to be passed back
and forth between the client and the
server using this a stack and needless
to say the same thing is going to happen
in the reverse direction for returning
the results so it is just that it is a
server stack that is going to have the
result and the server stub is going to
put it into the a stack and the client
stub is going to take it from the a
stack and give it to the client so that
the clients can start resuming its
execution so there is two copies
involved in going from the client to the
server and two copies involved in going
back to the client from the server</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
