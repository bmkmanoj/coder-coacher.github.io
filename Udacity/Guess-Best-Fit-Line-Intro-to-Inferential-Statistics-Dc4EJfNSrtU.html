downward sloping so it can't be any of
these positive slopes and it definitely
doesn't look like the data go through
this value up here or here and this one
looks like it slopes downward too
steeply we can see which one is better
but how do we determine mathematically
which is the best for example how do we
know that this line in blue isn't
slightly better there are a lot of lines
that could look like they best
approximate the data so we have to
mathematically find the exact a and B
the y-intercept and slope that will get
us the line of best fit how do we find
these regression coefficients let's look
at these examples again remember how we
talked about observed and expected
values let's say we're deciding if this
would be a good regression line for this
X value the expected value is way down
here for this x value the expected value
is also pretty far this x value looks to
be pretty close to the expected value
but these two are really far from their
expected values the same with this the
expected value for this value of x is
way up here so this residual actually
isn't too bad but the amount of the
residual gets worse and worse as we
continue same with this one if we
continued this line really far out the
residual for this data value would be
huge all of them would be pretty big and
these would be really big but here the
residuals are pretty small especially
compared to the other possibilities for
these two points the residuals are about
zero</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
