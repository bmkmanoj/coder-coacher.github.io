three of their nonces show that they
compute the correct X I value assuming
the encryption function has the
properties it should it should be
difficult to find r0 r 1 and our two
values that encrypt in the same way with
a different vote note that this requires
the property of the encryption function
that it's hard to do this by cheating by
finding a different vote with different
nonce values that encrypts the same
thing this is actually a required
property of encryption as long as the
encryption is invertible this would be
impossible if we could find to such
values well then we couldn't decrypt and
get the same X or Y out correctly that
went in so that's why this works that if
we willing to reveal these values and
show that they produce X I that proves
that someone somewhere along the chain
cheated if the votes not recorded in the
final tally the big drawback of this is
it requires that the voter reveals her
vote in order to show that her vote was
not included in the tally</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
