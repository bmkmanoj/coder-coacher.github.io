corresponding X values and we can see
that each of these pairs of numbers
where one is just the negative version
of the previous one all have matching Y
values despite their opposite signs in X
let's think about why this is well one
we can rewrite y equals x to the fourth
this is y equals x squared squared we
can do the same thing for something like
y equals x to the sixth that can be
written as y equals x to the third
squared now we know that whenever we're
squaring something it's going to involve
multiplying that thing by itself so if
what's inside here like X to the third
in the case of y equals x to the sixth
is negative squaring it is going to make
it positive that means that any sign
difference in sin x are going to be
cancelled out in y so that helps tell us
why even when we move over way far to
the left way to the negative side of the
graph on the x axis the general behavior
of the graph of a polynomial with an
even degree is going to match the
behavior on the right side because of
that squaring action here now if we had
a more complex polynomial here instead
of just y equals x to the fourth the Y
values these numbers might not line up
exactly they might not be exactly equal
because of the terms following this but
by the time we move way far out an X
either positively or negatively this
overall pattern would re-emerge and
we'll see the same general behavior on
either side of the graph</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
