analysis or EDA in the last few months I
learned about our a programming language
an EDA with the help of my friends from
Facebook and this course I'll teach you
how to use our to conduct exploratory
data analysis EDA is one part of the
larger process of collecting learning
from and acting on data in this course
I'll share my advice about working with
data and visualizations by the end of
this course you should feel confident
when exploring new datasets to uncover
meaningful patterns in the last lesson
I'll walk you through an analysis of the
diamond market with an eye toward
building predictive models we're excited
to teach this course and to show you how
ETA can be used to answer questions with
data but before we dig into EDA let's
talk about data data is ubiquitous you
can find information about hurricanes
forest fires and state finances on
websites like data gov social networking
sites like Facebook where we work
collect petabytes of data every day and
some people have started tracking their
own personal data using calendars mobile
apps and physical activity trackers
there is so much data out there in the
world and so little of it has been
explored for example I was poking around
on Google Trends the other day and
here's what I found I searched for the
word chicken because I had read a news
article that morning about chicken food
poisoning Salmonella and when I searched
for the word Google Trends gave me this
graph this graph shows the interest and
searched for the word chicken over time
and reality it's counting how many times
we see chicken and any newspaper
headlines in a given month so from 2005
to 2013 we can see that the occurrences
of chicken has been increasing now I
didn't want to stop my search there so I
decided to enter two more generic words
to see what I could find so I added the
word music and I added the word movies
and then I got this graph now when you
look at this graph tell me some things
that you notice you can talk about
anything interesting that you find in
this graph or you might compare the
first graph to this one and write some
things that you find now keep in mind
there's no right or wrong answer here I
just want to get you thinking about data</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
