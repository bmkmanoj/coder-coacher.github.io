figure out which set of parameters
provide the best predictions for our
output variable but how can we do that
we'll use an algorithm called gradient
descent first we need to define some
cost function which we'll call J of big
theta I'm going to use big theta here to
represent our entire set of Thetas and
I'll use this notation throughout the
rest of this lesson the cost function is
meant to provide a measure of how well
our current set of Thetas does at
modeling the observed data so we want to
minimize the cost functions value as we
discussed just a moment ago when we're
doing linear regression our cost
function J of theta can simply measure
the sum of the squares of the
differences between our predicted and
observed values I'm going to formalize
this a little bit and say this J of big
theta is equal to 1/2 times the sum from
I equals 1 to M of Y predicted of X I
minus y observed I squared where Y
predicted X I equals the sum of n from 0
to big n of theta n X and I so there's a
lot going on here and I've color-coded
this so why don't we walk through it
first we're just saying that J of big
theta is equal to 1/2 times the sum over
all of our data points of the predicted
Y given our X's our input variables -
Lee observed Y squared so this is just
our error squared term summed over all
the data points no different than the
equation that we have up here down here
we're just defining the way that we
calculate the predicted value of y given
our input variables in the way that we
do that is that we say we sum from N
equals zero to big n of theta n times xn
so we're just saying that we sum up the
xn each input variable times its weight
data this is no different than the sum
that we had on the last slide note that
we include an N equals 0 term here which
corresponds to a constant term in our
model which doesn't correspond to any of
the input variables for those of you
familiar with linear algebra if we
wanted to we could also express this as
theta transpose times X if you don't
know linear algebra don't worry about
this this is just another way of
expressing the same thing here that
might be easier for some students to
comprehend</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
