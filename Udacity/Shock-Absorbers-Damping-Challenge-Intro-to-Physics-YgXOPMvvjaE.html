problem we're gonna be talking about
damping so so far when we've been
talking about simple harmonic motion
we've been assuming that the motion just
continues forever in this nice
sinusoidal pattern in real life however
we have to deal with things like
friction and losses to heat when the
springs move up and down so in real life
oscillations often look a lot more like
this where they start out with a large
amplitude just like before but the
longer they continue to oscillate the
smaller their amplitude becomes as they
lose energy and this phenomenon is
called damping now they're actually
several different types of damping but
for our problem let's only consider this
type of damping which we call under
damping where the amplitude decays in
this kind of exponential pattern all
right now we're ready to move on to the
problem so suppose that our car here is
damped such that it loses twenty point
six percent of its energy per cycle so
that means that after a car hits say a
bump it'll oscillate with some initial
energy but after each cycle a cycle
being one pattern like this it will lose
twenty point six percent of its energy
so looking at this situation a bit more
mathematically we get this equation that
the energy of the oscillator after n
cycles is equal to zero point nine four
which is one minus twenty point six
percent to the N times the initial
energy e zero so what this equation is
saying is that after three cycles for
example the amount of energy left in the
oscillator will be equal to zero point
seven nine four to the third power times
e zero so my question for you is how
many cycles does it take what's this
value n in order for the amplitude to
decay to one-half of its original value
so if for example you said the answer
was four that would mean that after four
complete oscillations after four cycles
the amplitude of this oscillation would
be reduced to one half its original
value so put your answer here and round
your answer to the nearest whole cycle
so don't say three point five say four
for example so as I hate when you're
solving this problem you should keep in
mind that the energy of the oscillator
is directly proportional to the
amplitude squared
not just the amplitude so keep that in
mind when you're using this equation
here good luck</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
