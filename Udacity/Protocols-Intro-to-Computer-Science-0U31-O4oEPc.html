is a protocol and what a protocol is the
set of rules that people agree to that
tell you how to entities can talk to
each other so for the web the protocol
gives rules about how a client and a
server talk to each other the client is
the web browser and the server is the
web server so that might be udacity.com
the web browser is what you're running
at home and what the protocol says is if
you want to get the server to do
something the client has to send a
message in a particular way the protocol
that we use on the web is called
hypertext Transfer Protocol which is
abbreviated as HTTP when you look in
your browser
almost all the URLs that you use start
with HTTP that indicates that the
protocol that you should use to talk to
the server that you're requesting a
document from is this protocol called
hypertext Transfer Protocol and it's a
very simple protocol there aren't too
many messages there's actually only two
main messages and there's only one we'll
talk about that's the message called get
the client can send a message to the
server where the message says get and
then the name of the object that you
want to get so that's all the client
does it sends a message like this and if
you remember the Python code for get
page well it's calling some library
function that actually does this it's
sending the get message to the server
the server will get that message it will
do some run some code on it it will find
the file that was requested it might run
some more code to get the result take
the web application course to understand
more about what the server does but what
matters to the client and what matters
to us and using this is what happens
after that the server sends back a
response which is the contents of the
requested object so that's the whole
protocol that's what's going on whether
you send a web request using your
browser by clicking on a link well then
the browser's doing a lot of things to
figure out what you requested and then
it's sending a get message to the right
web server that was the server specified
by the URL to know which server it is
and then it's getting a response and
it's doing processing on that response
to render it
if you want to understand more about
what the web browser is doing take the
programming languages class that focuses
on how to build a web browser</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
