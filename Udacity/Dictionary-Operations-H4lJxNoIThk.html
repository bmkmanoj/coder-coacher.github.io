dictionary you're going to want to add
items to it to add a key value pair to a
dictionary set the value for the key
using subscript syntax so here we'll add
a couple entries to our animal groups
dictionary a group of crows is called a
murder I always thought that was a
strange one and a group of monkeys is
called a troop if we use the count
method which has the same syntax as the
array classes count method we can see
that before we had three entries but now
we have five and if we print out the
dictionary we can see the two new
entries removing a value from a
dictionary looks very similar to adding
a value but in this case the value for
the key is assigned to nil and after we
assign the value for crows to know we
can see that the crows murder pair has
been removed from the dictionary what if
we want to change the value associated
with a key for this we have a couple
options we can keep using the same
versatile subscript syntax like this
here let's change troop to barrel or we
could use the method update value for
key this method is interesting because
it returns an optional value this is
good because if you try to update a
value that's not in your dictionary your
program won't crash the update value
method will just return nil and go ahead
and add the new key value pair to the
dictionary and here you can see we've
added a crash of rhino soars to our
dictionary no pun intended i swear if
the dictionary does indeed contain the
value you tried to update the update
value for key method returns the former
value the old value like we saw here
when the method returned flock if you
want to retrieve the value for a
particular key you can use you guessed
it subscript syntax in other words the
dictionary name followed by the key in
square brackets let's scroll this up and
make a little more room one has to be
careful when retrieving values from
dictionaries because retrieving a value
for a given key from a dictionary
returns an optional why would a
dictionary return an optional I'm just
going to pause for a few seconds and let
you think it returns an optional because
there's always a chance that the key
value pair you're looking for isn't in
the dictionary
there are many cases in which a program
might ask for a value from a dictionary
not knowing whether it will be there or
not so it returns an optional and
naturally that optional needs to be
unwrapped we unwrap a value returned
from a dictionary using if let just like
we don't wrap any other optional in this
example we want to retrieve the value
for a group of whales and use that value
in this print statement so we unwrap it
like so and here the optional has a
value pod so what happens if the key
isn't found no problem we're covered
like in this example sasquatches are not
in our dictionary so the optional has an
ill value but that's okay because we've
specified exactly what we want the
program to do in case of an ill value</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
