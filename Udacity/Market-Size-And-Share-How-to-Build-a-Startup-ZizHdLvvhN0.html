what's the market size estimate how big
is this and what's the percentage market
share realistically you could get how
many can your distribution channel
actually sell and if you have your own
direct sales people do the math how many
customers can they call on it what price
and as you start putting all this into a
spreadsheet you'll actually start
building the classic income statement
balance sheet and cash flow we haven't
even had you do yet if you think about
this this entire conversation we've had
was how to get the basic data so you can
put together a revenue model that's
based on fact rather than fiction and
you are gonna start thinking about well
if I have a direct sales force humppa
how much can they sell in dollars or
from using an indirect channel what's a
realistic number they sell for other
customers how much will it cost to have
this distribution channel hopefully in
the last lecture you start thinking
about the cost of your channel how many
customer activations how much will it
cost to get customers into my physical
store or my virtual website and then as
we talked about earlier how much will it
cost to acquire a customer and by the
way not always a helpful how much is my
customer acquisition cost but what's
their lifetime value how many units will
they buy from each of these efforts</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
