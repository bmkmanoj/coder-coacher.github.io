models in her architecture class so that
she can depict buildings and she figured
out one really easy way to build a
rectangular building all you do is you
take a rectangular sheet of paper and
you just cut a square out of each corner
so you cut a square out of all four
corners and make each square the same
size so let's try it out and see what
happens
fallout 4 squares drawing
okay great so now we have a rectangle
without any corners now I have to do is
fold up the different flaps
and look we have a box if you want to
make it a permanent box we can always
tape each corner together
and look at that we have a building so
this may look pretty simple right now
but if you think about it we've only
dealt with area in this class so far and
that's really all that the theme is
talked about in our architecture classes
so far too but being able to make a box
or a building or whatever you want to
call this is really powerful this is a
three-dimensional object means it has
space that occupies and I can do stuff
with it like fill it with Eminem's this
could be a model building or it can hold
stuff they can hold mm so it can hold my
tape can do whatever I want with it
because this shape takes up volume
doesn't just have area has a volume this
is a totally new concept for our class
and also a new concept for Athena it's
going to be super important as she
continues to study architecture</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
