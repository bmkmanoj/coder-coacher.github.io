defining a recursive procedure and the
goal this time is to take in a string
and determine whether or not it's a
palindrome
what a palindrome is is a string that
reads the same way forwards and
backwards so an example of a palindrome
would be level if we read level four
words we get level if we read it
backwards we get exactly the same thing
another example of a palindrome would be
the word the single letter a if we read
a forwards we get a if we read a
backwards we also get a in fact any
single letter must be a palindrome the
empty string is also a palindrome if we
read the empty string for word we have
the empty string if we read the empty
string backward we also have the empty
string so our goal is to define a
procedure that will take any string as
input and output true if that string is
a palindrome I'm going to give you a few
hints how to do this but start thinking
on your own if you can think of a way to
define a procedure that tests whether or
not a string is a palindrome so this is
a pretty tough question see how far you
can get on your own but I'm going to
provide some hints before we make the
quiz so the first hint is we want to
think of what it means to be a
palindrome to try to formalize that
definition if we knew easy ways to
produce the reverse of the string and
check if it's equal well that would be
an easy way to solve this and in fact
there are ways to do that in Python but
we haven't seen them yet and I want to
have you think about ways to do is
palindrome that don't depend on that so
that means we need to think about a way
of defining is palindrome in terms of
simpler things so the first thing to
notice is there's one simple case where
we know right away whether it strings a
palindrome so we should think that that
might be our base case when we do
procedures on numbers our base case is
often something that deals with a number
like 0 or 1 a small number when we do
recursive procedures on strings it's
more likely that our base case is going
to be the simpler string which is the
empty string so we know that if the
input is empty string the result of this
palindrome is true the empty string is a
palindrome what if the inputs not an
empty string well then one way to solve
that would be to look at the
letter the string and look at the last
letter of the string if those two are
equal well then it might be a palindrome
it's a palindrome if all the ones left
over in the middle are also a palindrome
so this is how we could break the
question of testing whether strings a
palindrome into smaller steps that our
recursive case is going to test this
first and the last character of the
string see if those are equal so for a
recursive case we're gonna test the
first and last characters of the string
if those don't match we know it's not a
palindrome that means we know the result
is false if they do match we're not done
we need to check the rest of the string
and that means we need to check the
middle of the string if that's a
palindrome and because we're able to
define this recursively remember that
we're defining the procedure is
palindrome but we can do this test
assuming that we've already defined it
in order to check whether the middle of
the string is a palindrome we can use
the procedure that we're defining this
is like we were able to use factorial to
define factorial in terms of a smaller
number in this case we're defining a
palindrome in terms of a smaller string
so I hope this is enough for you to get
started so see if you can define the
code for is palindrome keeping in mind
that we can break it down into these two
cases where if it's empty we know it's a
palindrome right away if it's not empty
well we need to look at that first and
less characters if they do match we also
need to look at the middle of the string</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
