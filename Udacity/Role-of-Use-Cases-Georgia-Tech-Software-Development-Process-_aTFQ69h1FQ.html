about use cases use cases are
fundamental in UML and in general so now
I would like to discuss why they're so
important and what are the different
roles and use cases can play a first
obvious one is for requirements
elicitation it is much easier to
describe what the system should do if we
think about the system in terms of
scenarios of usage rather than trying to
describe the whole functionality of the
system at once so use cases can help
performing and more effective
requirements elicitation as we will see
when we discuss the unified software
process they can be used for
architectural analysis so use cases are
the starting point for the analysis of
the architecture of the system that can
help identify the main blocks of the
system and therefore can help define in
the initial architecture and as I said
we'll talk more extensively about that
they can be used for user prioritization
for example imagine to have multiple
actors in the system and you might want
to prioritize some of them for instance
using again the banking system example
we might want to first provide
functionality for the administrators of
the bank and only in a second time
provide functionality for the customers
because of course if the administrator
cannot perform any operation the
customers cannot use the system so again
they can be used to prioritize the users
or the actors and therefore define which
parts of the system should be built in
which shorter related to this point they
can be used for planning if I know which
pieces of functionality I need to build
an in which order I can better plan the
development of my system and again we
will see how this becomes very important
in many different software life cycles
so both in the unified software process
for instance but also in more agile
development processes and finally use
cases can be used for testing if I have
an early description of what the system
should do what are the main pieces of
functionality of the system and I know
how the interaction between the actors
and the system is I can easily define
test cases even before writing the code
even before defining my system and when
we discuss testing it will get back to
this and talk a little more extensively
about this as well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
