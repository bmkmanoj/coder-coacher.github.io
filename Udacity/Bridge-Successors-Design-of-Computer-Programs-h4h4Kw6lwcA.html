choice to say I'm going to represent a
state as a tuple of here there and T
we're here represents everything that's
on this side there represents everything
that's on that side and T is the total
elapsed time since the start and I'm
going to represent here and there with
frozen sets because those are hashable
and so this collection here would be the
frozen set consisting of 12 5 10 and
again just use the string light to
represent the flashlight you know and
there would be the empty frozen set now
consider this state here representing
the start state what are the successors
of that state well any one of the people
could go across they got to bring the
light with them in the successor state
the light will definitely be there and
it will not be here it can only be in
one places at least one of the people
will be over there and possibly two of
the people and so all combinations of
sending you to one person or two people
to the other side those will each be
distinct successor States so let's see
we got 4 times 3 is 12 but what it
doesn't matter so there's six of those
and then four more so it looks like
there should be ten successor States and
what I want you to do is right for me
the successor function we're calling it
be successors because we already had a
we're on to be or be could stand for
bridge and remember that a result of the
successor function is a dictionary of
state action pairs a state is this here
there T tuple here and there have to be
frozen sets and the frozen sets contain
people 1 2 5 and 10 and or this light
indicated by the string light show me
the function that will generate all the
successors here I've given you a hint of
here's a way to break up the state into
those three variables and then put your
code here oh one more thing I forgot is
what are the actions well let's say
than an action will be represented by
the character string arrow going to the
right if we're moving from here to there
and an arrow going to left if we're
moving from there to here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
