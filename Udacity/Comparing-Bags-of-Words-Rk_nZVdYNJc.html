that distribution to the distributions
of the word of the the images that you
know and you can do it as say like a
scalar dot product right so just the
histogram if you normalize it to 1 you
can think of it as a normalized vector
and I compare or unit vector I can
compare unit vectors for example by
taking dot product and finding nearest
neighbors so that's a Illustrated here
so I have some example D sub J and I
want to got some query Q and I want to
compare them and so here are my two
histograms so my histogram here is 1/8
1/4 my Instagram over here is 5 1 1 0 so
remember it's the same set of words
right we're just gonna say for all the
words in English
what's the histogram for all the words
in my collection
what's the histogram and I'm just gonna
compare say a similarity so here's one
example of where I take the dot product
between the D and Q divided by the
length and that's essentially giving me
a similarity between them and this is
just written out for I equal 1 to V
where the idea is that you have V number
of words and again we didn't talk about
exactly how you decided what V should be
that's sort of part of the art of doing
this work so that's essentially doing a
nearest neighbor lookup right given some
input nearest neighbor all right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
