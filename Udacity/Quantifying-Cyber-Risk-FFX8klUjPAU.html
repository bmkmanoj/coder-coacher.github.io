of is there a formula for risk or the
risk exposure that we have risk is
really we said how likely the
probability of an adverse security event
happening so you first thing you have to
say well there is a thread out there
they may come after me I have some
controls in place but they may be able
to get around them and actually i might
get compromised may experience a breach
or whatever it is so what is the
likelihood of that so you have to have
the probability then you have to
multiply by the impact of that adverse
event going to cost me a 10 million
dollars to deal with that well the
probability is half that's way too much
but if it is half and it's going to cost
you 10 million dollars your risk is 5
million dollars we said quantifying of
course you have to quantify both of
these quantities the probability as well
as the impact or the loss are you going
to suffer as a result of the adverse
event that we're talking about so
there's something called risk leverage
because we like to reduce our risk
exposure and one way we can do that is
by having some sort of a control in
place the control we know comes with a
cost so risk leverage is for a given
control talking about quantifying it and
then sort of if it's too high you don't
like it we can try to reduce it by
putting in one or more controls so if
when you put a control you can ask you
know what the risk leverage of that
control is so the way to sort of compute
that is that you say what was my risk
exposure before or without the control
that isn't under consideration that's
without deploying that minus the risk
exposure after this control is deployed
this difference really is nothing but
the amount by which the risk is reduced
because of this control that we're going
to put into our enterprise so that's the
decrease in risk / the cost of that
control that we're talking about we've
been saying we have to have cost benefit
analysis this is you know this is how
much risk this is what happens to risk
if we do something about an acceptable
level of risk so this is the cost of
that control that we have in the
denominator here so if you divide the
reduction in risk by the cost that gives
you the risk leverage for any control
that you have risked leverage should be
greater than 1 it makes no sense for it
to be less than 1 because in that case
is saying risk reduction actually is
smaller than the cost it's not very
smart that you pay more and overall
you're not in a better place than you
were before in terms of the cost and
whatever risk that you have so this is
how we compute the leverage and whenever
you talk about a particular control if
you do this and the value is not greater
than one then of course that control
should not be considered</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
