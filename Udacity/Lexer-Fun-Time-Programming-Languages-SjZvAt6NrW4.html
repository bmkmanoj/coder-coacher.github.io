analyzer and what I'm going to show you
is how to test things out or change
things around for example let's go up
here and turn this into a quoted string
so previously our first token was the
word this but when I rerun it I'm really
expecting to see the string this because
I've put this in quotes and now it is
the string this these other numbers
after lexical analyzer token string with
token' value this are the line in
character number information the token
corresponding to this starts on line one
at character 0 the token corresponding
to is starts on line one character 70
one two three four five six seven yep
that's where the eye starts so let's say
we made a mistake we got one of our
regular expressions wrong let's say that
I mistakenly put in a greater than sign
here for L angle / no then right after
my I would expect to see the output
change I'm going to expect to see us get
the wrong answer currently right after
my we CL angle / let's rerun it oh now
we don't see quite the right thing at
all right after the B we see lnl angle /
but its associated with the wrong text
after my we just see an L angle the
slash has made its way into this word be
by looking at this output we can notice
mistakes in our lexical analyzer and
help fix them I repair the problem rerun
and the world looks quite a bit better
here I've used pythons triple quoting
approach we have the word tricky the
quoted string string L angle word our
angle output Ln go /i our angle word and
then we're done let's go see how this
comes out we got the word tricky the
string string and if you've noticed
we've shaved off the two double quotes
which is just what we wanted an L angle
the I the
right angle the word output l angle /
bang at the end</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
