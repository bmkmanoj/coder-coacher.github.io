conventional networks it's easier to
coordinate behavior among a network of
devices the behavior of the network is
easier to evolve and it's also easier to
reason about these characteristics are
all rooted in the fact that the control
plane is separate from the data plane
having a separate control plane or
control program allows us to apply
conventional Cs techniques to old
networking problems so whereas before it
was incredibly difficult to reason about
or debug a network's behavior if the
network behavior is now controlled by a
logically centralized control program we
can use techniques from programming
languages or software engineering to
help us reason about the behavior of the
network as far as SDNS infrastructure is
concerned the control plane is typically
a software program written in a
high-level language such as Python or C
on the other hand the data plane is
typically programmable hardware that's
controlled by the control plane the
controller effects the forwarding state
that's in the switch using control
commands open flow is one standard that
defines a set of control commands by
which a controller can control the
behavior of one or more switches Sdn has
many applications including data centers
wide area backbone networks enterprise
networks internet exchange points or
IXPs and home networks later modules in
this course will explore how
software-defined networks can solve
network management problems in some of
these areas in this course we will focus
in particular on the first three
applications</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
