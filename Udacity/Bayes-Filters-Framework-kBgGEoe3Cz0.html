filter framework and so given four
things first is I'm gonna need some
prior belief about where I'm starting
okay so that's P of X where did that
come from again remember that drive up
to Delphi and asking the Oracle and all
that stuff so you forgot your luggage so
you went back to Delphi you got another
prior and it tells you how things are
starting but again maybe with a large
uncertainty so here we have our
dynamical system model and so it's the
probability of some new X given my
belief about the previous X plus this
input by the way you see here it says u
sub t minus 1 the the the the world is
sometimes schizophrenic about whether
you think of the input is happening just
after the last measurement so it was you
at t minus 1 or you happen now and i
want to estimate what the state is now
so whether it's UT or UT minus 1 it's
whatever you you're gonna add on to XT
minus 1 in order to make your prediction
about XT alright so we're given these
two things we're given a prior and
action model we're also given a sensor
model and this is going to be really
important a little bit important this
lesson very important next lesson and
the sensor model is our likelihood okay
and it is not gonna tell you what it
isn't first it is not given some sensor
meeting reading where do I think the
object is you might think that's what it
is but then you would be thinking
incorrectly no a likelihood model is if
the object were really someplace what's
the likelihood of my measurement so
normally what you'll see is and we're
gonna seem something later like a little
Gaussian blob drawn over the place where
the measurement was that does not mean
okay that given this measurement this is
my distribution of where things are no
no no what it means is this is my
likelihood so its highest if X was
actually at this point
and then it falls off slowly all right
that's the likelihood and then finally
we're given the stream of observations
the Z's so Z 1 through Z t minus 1 or
through Z T and also we know the actions
okay so we know the action data uu1
through you t minus 1 ok so those are
the four things that we have all right
what do we want well what we want is the
estimate of X at time T okay same thing
we've always wanted since we were little
children and in the bayesian world this
is called the belief or the posterior of
this state right and so sometimes it's
even written like this B el4 a belief of
XT what's my belief about XT given
everything that I've observed so far
knowing all their perturbations and
given my current measurement</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
