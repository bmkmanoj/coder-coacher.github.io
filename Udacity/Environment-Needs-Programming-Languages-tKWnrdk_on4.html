and we've established they need to do
two different things map variables to
values and also point to the parent
environment so we're actually just going
to represent environments as a tuple of
the parent pointer or none if it's the
global environment and the dictionary
mapping variable names to values that
means that i can finally provide you
with the definition of that environment
look up procedure we promised earlier
remember that our procedure check your
pockets check your hotel room check your
actual home that doesn't work try to buy
it on the interwebs let's go see how
this goes we'll just look and see if
this variable name is in our environment
but remember that our environment is
actually a tuple of a parent in a
dictionary so we're going to have to
select out the once element in order to
check this out if we have a binding for
our variable name in the current
environment we just return that binding
we get out our dictionary and we look up
the value associated with v name in it
if we were the global environment and we
didn't know the answer then we'll just
return none we don't know what the deal
is we could try to do something else
here like flag and error for now let's
just return some default value but if we
are not the global environment if I
don't have it in my pockets I can check
my hotel room and then my house and I'll
do that by getting my parent pointer out
of position zero and calling myself
recursively and the astute among you may
notice that i was too lazy to actually
call the formal parameter VAR underscore
name so let's just leave it at v name
for variable name so that's our look up
procedure step one do we have it step
two are we the global environment step
three if we're not the global
environment ask our parents similarly we
now know how to update an environment or
we could work our way through it if we
already have a binding for this variable
name then we'll just change that binding
this is a dictionary and here i just
updated the value that corresponds to V
name in that dictionary otherwise if I'm
not the global environment I can ask my
parents to store the value for me if I
am the global environment and I didn't
define your variable then this is
problematic we should have allocated
space earlier so here I'm going to
actually define some environments in
Python rather than drawing pretty
pictures of them
and we're going to run through some
practice problems to make sure we
understand this this will be fill in the
blanks i'm going to call environment
look up of x in the new environment
what's that kind of return so then after
we look up why in the global environment
we make a change we assign X to be 55 in
the new environment and then we print
out X in the new environment and the
global one how do these things turn out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
