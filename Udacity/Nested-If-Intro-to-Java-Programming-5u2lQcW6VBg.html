o need to have an es added so if the
last letter is o or the last letter is s
I return letters plus es this condition
is pretty ugly and it seems like I'm
going to be talking about the last
letter index a lot so I'm going to
declare a variable and now i can replace
all of these with just last that looks a
bit better let's see if our program
works for this case now i'll need to
return something in the else clause
since just adding an S seem to be sort
of a default leftover case I'll just
return letters plus s here I'll run my
word tester we want to look at the cases
that end with o or s for example kisses
it looks like right now our actual value
for kisses matches what we expected it
looks like we also got some for free all
of the leftover default cases where you
just add an S are working pretty well
right now massages looks good judges
looks good laps cats clocks but there
are some still aren't working and dishes
should be dishes not dish so let's go
back to our word the case for why being
the last letter was a little bit more
complicated because it mattered whether
there was a consonant before it or a
vowel before it so let's add a case for
when the last letter is why we need to
account for two possibilities if the
second to last letter is a consonant we
take off the Y and add a yes we can use
substring to cut off the last letter
which is the Y and then add back IES
otherwise if the letter before the Y is
a vowel we just add s now it should be
better if I go back to my word tester
and run it one more time it should work
for cherries which it does and it hasn't
broken boys or days which also ended in
Y so that's a good sign
still not working well for dishes or
witches it looks like if it ends in an H
then we need to return the letters with
an es instead of just s let's check that
it looks like dishes is right now which
is also looking better judges laps cats
clocks these all look good but baths
isn't right now baths just turned into
Bates I think we need an exception for
when there's a tea before the H so let's
go back and do that if the last letter
is H then if is the second to last so if
the second to last letter is an S or a
see then we add es otherwise just s and
now they should all match so it looks
like it works but can we simplify the
code at all the code i just wrote was
pretty complicated now that you have a
working version you could spend five
minutes trying to simplify the code you
can check whether your simplifications
work by running the tester again and if
you get a very simple or very short
version compared with another short
version that I'm going to post in the
forum there should be a link somewhere
