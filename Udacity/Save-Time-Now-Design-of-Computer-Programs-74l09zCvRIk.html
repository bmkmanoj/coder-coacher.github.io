is will want to have before and after
pictures showing the amazing weight loss
of a model that was fat before and was
thin after applying memo oh oh wait a
minute it's not weight loss it's time
loss that we're going to try to measure
we want to show that before we have a
function f and that's going to run very
slowly making us sad and after we have a
function memo of F and that's going to
run very quickly making us happy now we
could do that with a timer and say it
took 20 seconds to do this and point 01
seconds after but instead of doing it
with timing i think it's a little bit
more dramatic just to show the number of
function calls and i could go into my
function and modify it to count the
number of function calls but you can
probably guess a better way to do that
i'm going to define a decorator to count
the calls to a function because i'm
probably going to want to count the
calls to more than one function as i'm
trying to improve the speed of my
programs and so it's nice to have that
decorator around so here's the decorator
count calls you pass it a function and
this is the function that it returns
going to be a function that just
increments entry for this function in a
dictionary call accounts increment that
by one and then go ahead and apply the
function to the arguments and return
that result and we have to initialize
the number of calls to each function to
be zero and that's all there is to it so
here i've defined the Fibonacci function
through cursive function it calls itself
twice for each call except for the base
case I can count the calls both with and
without the memorized version and so I'm
going to do before and after pictures
before and after memorizing so here's
before I have the values of n the value
computed for Fibonacci number of n the
number of calls created by count calls
and then I've had the ratio of the
number of calls to the previous number
and we see the number of calls goes up
by the time we get up to N equals 20 we
got ten thousand calls we can scroll
down and by the time we're up to N
equals 30 we have 2.6 million calls and
here's the after now we've applied the
memo decorator now the number
calls is much more modest now at 20
we're only at 39 calls and at 30 we're
at 59 calls rather than 2.6 million so
that's pretty amazing weight loss to go
from 2.6 million down to 59 just by
writing one little decorator and
applying it to the function now just as
an aside here and for you math fans in
the audience I'm back to the before part
this is without the memoization this
number here in this column is the ratio
of the number of calls for N equals 32
the number of calls for n equals
twenty-nine and you can see it's
converging to this number 1 point 6 180
math fans out there I want you to tell
me if you recognize that number do you
think it's converging to 1 plus square
root of 5 over 2 25 point 888 over 1600
or the square root of V</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
