addresses as if they belonged to hosts
well they kind of do but it's more
accurate to say that addresses don't
belong to hosts so much as they belong
to interfaces a host like this laptop
can have multiple network interfaces and
each interface can have zero or more
addresses for example this laptop might
have a wired Ethernet interface and a
Wi-Fi interface and every machine also
has a loopback interface which can be
used for talking to itself and there are
other kinds of interfaces as well for
example you might have a tunnel to
another part of the network or if you
bring up a vm on a system like virtual
box for instance there can be a virtual
machine interface connecting the host
operating system and the guest operating
system now on linux you can find out
what interfaces your machine has with
the command IP a derp show in this case
showing that this machine has a loopback
interface and an ethernet interface ello
an d th 0 and here other ipv4 addresses
there are other commands that can do
this as well for instance on a Mac or
other UNIX system might use the ifconfig
command and on Mac OS 10 you'll find
that a system has an awful lot of
interfaces many of which aren't used for
internet traffic but for other things
like finding printers you can compare
the address as you see here against your
network configuration in the GUI to find
out what interface you're actually using
a little bit more about that loopback
interface the loopback is a special
interface that almost always has the IP
address 127 dot 0 dot 0 dot 1 and the
hostname localhost and allows programs
to use the network stack to talk to
other programs on the same host whenever
you've made connections to local host or
127 dot 0 dot 0 dot one before those are
going over the loopback interface</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
