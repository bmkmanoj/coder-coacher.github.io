subtraction it's very easy to implement
it's easy to do in real time fast and
the background models don't have to be
constant they can change so we can sort
of track that change the disadvantage of
course is you know frame differencing is
a real problem because depends upon how
things move the median background can be
a high memory requirement we talked
about keeping all that and you of course
you have to build a set these thresholds
when does this basic approach fail well
it fails a lot of times moving can we
talked about but one one idea that has
come up that has really gotten a lot of
play is that suppose your background
actually has a couple of different
things that might be in it right so the
example that that I'll show you in a
minute you're looking at water and
sometimes it's plain water and sometimes
there's a specularity or you might be
looking at some areas where there's some
foliage and you might get you know one
color from leaf and one color from the
thing that's not see these pics pixels
are essentially in the background there
twinkling between a couple of different
values all right and that analysis was
the basis of a paper that's now very
well known by Christopher and Eric
crimson on doing adaptive background
modeling and here they're showing you a
couple different examples so we'll use
to them one is the water here and the
idea is that the water most of the time
it's kind of this dark color and that's
shown as this distribution is sorting a
low value this is a you can think this
is an orgy space but when they get
bright specularity you get this high
value likewise this area where the door
is well when the door is open it's
bright because it's light it's lit by
the light in the hall in the office but
when the door is open it's much darker
and it's over there so the idea is that
there's multiple values in the
background so what they did was they
said ok we're going to model the
background as a mixture of gaussians
that is we're going to say that the
background could be made up of a couple
of different distributions of
intensities and we're going to learn
those distributions
so if a pixel comes in if it comes from
one of those gaussians I'll say its
background and if it isn't if it's new
then I would say I think that's a new
object I might hold on to it to see if
it becomes background but that's how you
do the detection one of the cool things
about that i'll tell you that early on
when papers like this we're being done
like i said people thought background
subtraction was sort of trivial I think
this paper is one of the paper that won
the long and Higgins prize for being
most cited ten years after was published
because it just became a really
important piece of work</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
