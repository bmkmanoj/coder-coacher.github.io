more difficult to climb the staircase
what we're actually seeing here when we
see a staircase with the greater
steepness then this one is a staircase
with a larger slope but we're
mathematicians it's not enough to know
that this one is steeper than this one
we want to know by how much we want to
put a number to this thing we call slope
and the definition of slope is that it's
the vertical change / the horizontal
change or a good way to remember this is
that it's the rise / the run and we'll
talk a little bit about what this means
so for example let's look at this set of
stairs and let's say that they have a
vertical change a height we could say a
5 feet they also have a horizontal
change which is also 5 feet this
staircase on the other hand has a
vertical change of 10 feet but also has
a horizontal change of 5 if i want to
calculate the slope of this staircase i
would take the vertical change the rise
of 5 feet and divide it by the run also
5 feet and 5 divided by 5 is equal to 1
likewise for this staircase if i want to
calculate the slope i'd use 10 feet as
the rise because that's how tall the
staircases and I / this horizontal run
of five and 10 / 5 is equal to 2 so this
is the slope of 1 and this is a slope of
2 so just like we said intuitively that
this staircase is steeper our slope
calculation this is the same thing
because two is bigger than one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
