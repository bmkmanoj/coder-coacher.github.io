that you are conducting one of your
studies is the use of psilocybin in the
treatment of nicotine dependence which
seems kind of counterintuitive could you
talk a little bit about that study yes
yes so back in the 1950s and 60s there
were several studies done primarily with
LSD and treatment of alcoholism and
those studies were done in a way that is
very difficult to interpret the validity
of their results according to our own
partly methodology partly how they
handled the data so given the experience
we had with psilocybin at Johns Hopkins
we thought we would put together an
intervention to look at addictions we
picked cigarette smoking because we
thought it was an interesting form of
addiction in some ways it's a pure
addiction it's its unencumbered by the
kind of social and physiological
consequences you have with severe
alcoholism for instance or or heroin
addiction or cocaine addiction yet it's
it's the most pernicious form of
addiction that we have worldwide and
people who are dependent on tobacco you
can ask them it's not an easy drug to to
quit so with we've mounted a pilot study
we've enrolled about 15 people to date
and the results look very promising we
don't have a control group but the
results that we're seeing to date is
that the great majority of our people
are entirely abstinent from cigarette
smoking so how does this work what how
does it want a single session or in this
case two or three sessions with
psilocybin get people to quit smoking
well it's embedded this psilocybin
session is embedded in the context of a
cognitive behavioral therapy for
cigarette smoking cessation so prior to
the psilocybin session people learn
about cognitive behavioral approaches
for for smoking they and
charting the number of cigarettes they
take they they rate their urges their
cravings they note the situation under
which they smoke they look at the
reflexive and kind of habitual pattern
in which they reach for a cigarette so
we're introducing a level of mindfulness
into their cigarette smoking but then
when combined with the psilocybin
session and for reasons we don't fully
understand really result in people being
able to walk away from their addiction
what people will very often report is a
transformed relationship to smoking that
before the psilocybin session smoking
hey held a salience e for them that was
much larger than their ability to cope
with that they were addicted they knew
they were addicted they couldn't stop
their cravings they were they were
hooked and with the expansive form of
consciousness that can come about with
psilocybin and when the intentionality
is brought into the session to really
deeply look and heal people walk away
from that session with this renewed
sense of self-efficacy realizing that
they're they're autonomous beings that
they can watch moods and cravings and
habitual patterns come up into their
field of consciousness but they can
choose not to act on those so it's not a
magic bullet it doesn't take away the
cravings it doesn't take away the
habitual tendency to maybe want a
cigarette but they can reframe it in a
way that for many of them seems really
quite magical it's like oh you know it's
like Dorothy and the in her shoes and
The Wizard of Oz she didn't know she'd
been wearing them the whole time
and and it's that sense of efficacy that
people come away with we think
mechanistically it might have to do with
increased enhancement of executive
function that's kind of a catchphrase
for how we can organize our cut
cognitions and behaviors you know in in
real time so that's what we have today
we're ready to initiate a control
clinical trial it's a very interesting
area and and it won't be restricted of
course ultimately to nicotine there's no
reason that this couldn't be an approach
for any addictive disorder but more than
that probably any form of radical
behavioral change so they're they're
real in fascinating implications here
and these are small clinical trials
being conducted around the United States
well right now we all we have is this
one pilot trial and it's an uncontrolled
pilot trial at Johns Hopkins but the
results are are so promising that that
they really call for a control clinical
trial and what I suspect is that once we
go ahead and report this kind of work
there'll be other probably academic
sites will come in and start doing more
research but we actually need to do the
research because these compounds have
been so demonized culturally and within
the medical in the treatment community
the first impulse is this doesn't make
any sense that sounds crazy right well
thank you so much rolling Griffis for
your time today we really appreciate it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
