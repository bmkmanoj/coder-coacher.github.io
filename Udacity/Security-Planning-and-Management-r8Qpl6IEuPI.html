planning and management there are many
different pieces that make up this whole
process of planning and then managing
that security how do we bring it all
together if you're going to go explain
this to someone in a few minutes what
are the things you should be talking
about well first of all you're gonna say
that there are things that are of value
which are at risk maybe your reputation
maybe your intellectual property there
are assets that are of value which are
at risk so then you're gonna talk about
the risk comes from certain threat
sources not only there are bad guys out
there of course we have certain
vulnerabilities those are the attack
vectors that's why those threat sources
would be able to do us harm that's why
we need to worry about the risk comes
from the fact not just because we have
something of value but that thing could
be harmed or it could be breached
so the threats and attack vector is
really talking about threats and
vulnerabilities together they come
together result in an attack so an
attack then leads to a breach and that's
where we have their adverse consequences
so we if we have that we had to talk
about things out of value we have to
talk about threats these two are the
reasons that help us explain that there
is something at risk and amount or level
of risk that we may have and the way to
manage that risk is to plan for security
implement whatever controls that are
meaningful and then sort of manage that
in terms of controls people processes
and things like that and all that has to
be done again these controls that we're
talking about of course we look at the
cost the benefits they offer now what
impact they have how user-friendly they
are things like that so we have to sort
of look into the controls that we have
what their effectiveness is then we have
to identify people it's their job to
worry about security we have to empower
them to do it they have to have the
budget they have to be able to have
policies that can be enforced and things
like that and those people have to be
held responsible and accountable because
we know that something was wrong they
should be called to answer what
exactly happen and no matter how well
you do that we have to plan for
something going wrong and when something
goes wrong a response is gonna be needed
the mediation has to happen there
shouldn't be any surprises we should be
prepared and have a plan in place saying
if something bad were to happen this is
how are we going to respond to it of
course people as we said need to be
aware of the importance of security the
guiding principles the do's and don'ts
all the things that are we talking about
under security policy so we need to
think about that and finally we need to
understand and people have recognized
that a proactive posture is what gets
you ahead of the threats in some sense
threats change continuously if you're
just going to be in reactive mode
something new is going to come and hit
you and you're going to suffer the same
sort of thing that you did before so
proactively addressing the risk and the
threats and the vulnerabilities and
having a champion to do that is another
part of this security planning and
management that we're talking about
overall understand what is of value why
it is there's risk to it which is the
threat and the vulnerabilities they're
talking about and then plan implement
manage and do that all proactively
that's sort of bringing it all together
when it comes to security planning and
management</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
