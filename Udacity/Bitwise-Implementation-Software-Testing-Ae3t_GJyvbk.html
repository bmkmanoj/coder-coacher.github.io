these two functions and so the deal is
is that it's really easy to write
straightforward code for these so let's
take a quick look so here's how common
bits all we're going to do is what we're
going to do is walk through the bits in
the input and here I'm assuming a 64-bit
input we're going to walk through the
input reversed so from 63 to 0 and every
time we see two bits being the same in a
and B we copy that bit to the output as
soon as we see two bits at the same
position that are different in a and B
we set that bit position in the output
and return it and low common bits is
just the same the only thing that's
different is we loop from 0 to 63
instead of 63 20 but we do exactly the
same thing we're copying bits in the
output as long as they're common between
a and B and then as soon as we see a
difference setting the bit and returning
so what we have here is a really slow
implementation so even if we translate
this implementation straightforwardly to
see it's still going to be really slow
compared to optimized implementations so
optimized implementations of this are
going to be potentially more complicated
and potentially harder to get right but
they might execute in just a handful of
clock cycles as opposed to maybe 100
clock cycles for the optimized see
versions and probably thousands of clock
cycles cycles for the Python so of
course performance isn't really going to
be our concern here we're just using
this to illustrate an issue that comes
up in extremely optimized try codes so
the fact that we're trying so hard to
optimize these codes means we're gonna
have some concerns about whether they
are correct or not so let's talk about
how we're going to deal with that so
we're probably going to do is write a
random tester the reason we're going to
write a random tester is with 64-bit
inputs the input domain for either of
these functions is going to contain two
to the hundred and twenty elements so
it's far too big to exhaustively test
we're going to be forced to do some sort
of either systematic testing or random
testing there's no way out of partial
testing of these functions and so the
most obvious kind of random tester to
write would be make a random 64-bit
integer make another one and now assert
that our super super optimized high
common bits function called with a and B
returns the same result as a reference
implementation I showed showed you the
Python version this is sort of simple
incredibly obvious code and maybe a
reference implementation is see it
doesn't really matter we're just going
to randomly test all sorts of
configurations of this of this function
so the question we need to ask is is
this a good random tester and what we
might do is run the code coverage tool
so let's go ahead and do that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
