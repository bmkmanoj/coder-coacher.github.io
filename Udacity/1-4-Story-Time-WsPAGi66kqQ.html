is fascinating especially when it comes
to 2d and 3d projection whether you're
creating a side-scrolling platformer or
a first-person shooter it turns out that
how the graphics are transformed and
manipulated before they reach the screen
is very similar as you might expect 2d
can be considered as just a special case
of 3d and in fact that's how many
frameworks and development tools treat
2d objects and scenes it's a question of
perspective literally we usually think
of perspective as a feature only of 3d
games like driving games or first-person
shooters because they tend to look like
the physical world looks they're
vanishing points where lines converge
and objects appear smaller the farther
way they get this is because they rely
on perspective projection to render
objects on a flat screen but there's
another whole category of projection
called parallel projection that produces
very different results in fact one kind
of parallel projection called
orthographic can turn a 3d scene into a
typical platform or side view or a
top-down 2d map this allows 2d game
developers to use today's powerful
feature rich 3d development tools then
achieve the look and feel they want
simply by changing the properties of the
main camera view this is the approach
will take for our game we'll use an
orthographic projection to render it in
the style of a classic sideview
platformer later you might experiment on
your own with other kinds of projections
they're fun to play around with
isometric projection is popular right
now think of Crossy Road or monument
valley at first glance it looks like
objects are drawn with perspective but
then you notice there's no
foreshortening which is a classic
feature of perspective drawing one time
in a hairbrained attempted optimization
I accidentally created rather exotic
projection in which all straight lines
curved subtly kind of like a fisheye
lens but not exactly I was trying to
simplify the math for speed and was
experimenting with spherical coordinates
the result wasn't really practical for
my purposes at the time but it found its
way into other projects later on
it was cool</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
