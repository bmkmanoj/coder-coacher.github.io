boolean formula here a bit and you'll
notice that none of the pre-processing
rules that we had in the previous quiz
apply now so there's no class here with
just a single variable so that rule
doesn't apply and also each variable
appears at least once so X 1 appears 1 2
3 4 times X 2 1 2 3 times and so on so
each variable appears at least twice and
also the other pre-processing rule
doesn't apply because each variable here
appears more than once so X 1 for
example appears four times it appears
here here here and here and the same
thing for all the other variables so
they all appear at least twice so we
can't use the rule that we just devised
if a variable appears just once
nevertheless so if you look at x1 x2 x3
and x4 we're again going to ignore x5
here then I think it's still possible to
kind of easily see for one of those
variables here if that should be set to
true or false of course this is a bit
harder than the previous question but I
think you can nevertheless figure it out
if you look closely at those four
variables here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
