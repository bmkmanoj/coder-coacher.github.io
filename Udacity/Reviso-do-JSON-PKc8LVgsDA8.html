earthquake data that we need for our app
we should discuss the structure or
format of the data that we get back from
the USGS API when we say format we mean
to discuss the specifics of how the data
is organized or structured so that we
know how to dissect and extract the
parts we need for our app earlier in
this lesson we reviewed some of the HTTP
request parameters that were available
to us to query the USGS data set one of
those parameters format equals value
allows us to specify the response format
or structure of how we'd like the
response data to be sent we opted for
format equals goj sign which sends the
data back to us in a structure using the
JSON syntax rules
well there are other formats that have
strengths and weaknesses and histories
beyond the scope of this class we chose
JSON because this is the most common
response format used by many of today's
signature web services that's not to say
JSON is decidedly better than any other
format such as XML
moreover we encourage you to explore
other formats in your free time to get a
better sense of the design intention the
strengths and weaknesses and even the
histories of those formats like all
technology the web has changed rapidly
over time in various formats have
emerged
rest assured though the experience you
will gain by familiarizing yourself with
JSON will also help you pick up on other
formats quickly so let's zoom in on JSON
for the USGS Earthquake API we have a
format called geo JSON available geo
JSON is just a special flavor of JSON
custom tailored to represent
geographical information JSON stands for
JavaScript object notation from the name
you might assume that it's tightly
coupled with the JavaScript programming
language that's actually not the case
JSON while originally designed to help
facilitate efficient communication on
the web and hence it's tied to
JavaScript is really just a set of some
tactical rules to organize data and thus
is completely programming language
independent
so JSON can be interpreted using any
programming language of choice including
the Java code that we use to build our
Android apps let's start to learn how to
read JSON by looking at a really simple
example this example describes a kind of
shoe let's start at the root left brace
which notes the start of a JSON object
everything inside it before the closing
right brace is its contents you can
think of these braces as a container of
stuff at the heart of the JSON
syntactical structure is the notion of
key value pairing syntactically the key
is on the left of the Colin and the
value is on the right this pairing is
simply a way of encapsulating a tie or
an association between a name of our
choosing
aka the key and its corresponding value
it turns out this is an important
semantics in programming in computer
science
why well this mapping or binding of a
key to a value helps us recall the data
layer in an easier and more logical
manner in other words when we want to
pull up or recall the data layer instead
of having to remember all the specifics
of the data because in some case it
could be a lot of data we can do this
just by using its tag or key think of a
coat check when you're going to the
symphony hall you might have dropped off
a lot of items at the coat check counter
but all you need to do to get your stuff
back is to hold on to your ticket and
give it to the attendant at the end of
the show let's look at a few examples of
keys here we have the string key size
which references a positive decimal
number which happens to be for the shoe
size of nine point five when we see a
comma this is simply a delimiter to let
us know that there's another key value
pair following okay so we also have wide
which maps to the boolean value of true
then we have country of origin which is
a string set to USA this key value
semantics is starting to feel pretty
straightforward right
cool these have been pretty simple keys
keys illogical names that map to simple
primitives that you've been used here
numbers boolean z' and strings but wait
the key style maps to a value of what
what is this brace here this is a whole
bunch of other stuff going on what are
you doing to me here this could be kind
of interesting and in fact this is where
the power and extensibility of JSON as a
data format lies let's take a break and
we'll take a deeper look at the possible
values in the next node</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
