an understanding of how powerful one of
these perceptron units are so what is it
that they actually do so they return in
this case either 0 or 1 as a function of
a bunch of input so let's just for
simplicity of visualization let's just
imagine that we've got two inputs x1 and
x2 so Charles how could we represent the
region in this input space that is going
to get an output of 0 versus the region
that's going to get an output of 1 what
are the weights right so indeed the
weights matter so let's let's give some
concrete values to these weights and
let's just say just making these up that
weight 1 is 1/2 weight to is a half and
hour threshold theta is 3/4 so now what
we want to do is again break up this the
space into where is it going to return 1
and where is it we're going to return 0
okay so I think I know how to figure
this out
so there's kind of an assorted extreme
example so let's take a case where x1 is
0 X 1 is 0 K good so that's this y-axis
uh-huh so if x1 is 0 what value at x2
have to be in order to break a threshold
of 3/4 well the weight on x2 is 1/2 so
then the value of x2 would have to be
twice as much as the threshold which in
this case is 1 and 1/2 all right so
we're trying to figure out where is it
the K if x1 is 0
where does x2 need to be so that we're
exactly at the threshold so that's going
to be right x2 times the weight which is
1/2 has to exactly equal the threshold
which is 3/4 so if we just solve that
out we get x2 equals 3 halves so ok so
that's this point here that's going to
be a divining line so anywhere above
here what is it going to return it will
return it will break the threshold and
so it returned a 1 these are all going
to be ones and then below this these are
all going to be zeros right all right
well now we have a very very skinny
version of the picture well what else
can we do well we can do the same thing
that we just did except swap x2 and x1
because they have the same weight so we
could set x2 equal to 0 and figure out
what value
x-1 have to be good and that seems like
it would be exactly the same algebra and
so we get X 1 is three-halves gives us
at the one-and-a-half point above here
are going to be ones below here are
going to be 0 ok so now we've got two
very narrow windows but what we notice
is that the relationships are all linear
here so this solving this linear
inequality gives us a picture like this
so this perceptron computes a kind of
half plane right so the half the plane
that's above this line the half plane
that's above this line is getting us the
one answers and below that line is
giving us the 0 answers so Michael can
we generalize from this so you're
telling me then that because of the
linear relationship drawn out by a
perceptron that perceptrons
are always going to compute lines
they're always going to compute ya these
half planes right so there's a dividing
line where you're equal to the threshold
and that's always going to be a linear
function and then it's going to be you
know to the right of it or the left of
it or the above it or below it but it's
always going to be halfsies at that
point okay so perceptron is a linear
function and it computes hyperplane
yeah which since maybe in some sense
doesn't seem that interesting but it
turns out we're already in a position to
compute something fascinating so let's
do a quiz</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
