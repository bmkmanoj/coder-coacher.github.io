states in planning let us look at how to
specify the operators so consider the
operator climb ladder we might specify
the climb blighter operator and any
other operator in general to a set of
preconditions and postconditions so for
the climb ladder operator the
precondition might be that the robot is
on the floor and the ladder is dry
notice that these are being written in
the language of propositional logic and
the post condition for the crime writer
operator might be to the robot is in the
ladder this captures the notion that the
robot is climbed a ladder it was earlier
on the floor and later on this on the
ladder several things to note here first
by convention the precondition does not
have any negative literals all the
literals in the precondition are
positive post conditions of operators
may have negative literals second the
meaning of these preconditions and
postconditions is that these assertions
are true in the world before this
operator can be applied and that these
assertions become true in the world
after this operator has been applied
this captures the syntax of the operator
client ladder the semantics of this
operator is that this operator can be
applied if and only if the preconditions
of the operator are true in the world it
cannot be applied 50 preconditions are
not true in the world</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
