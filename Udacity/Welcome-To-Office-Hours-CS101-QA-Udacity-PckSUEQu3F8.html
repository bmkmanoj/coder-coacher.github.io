cs101 i'm here with Peter Chapman the
assistant for the class you've been
seeing Peter a lot online you may not
have seen them in person until now and
we want to thank you all for all the
questions you've been posting in the
forums and voting on the popular
questions and we'll get started
answering them now okay so our first
question is from user Mortazavi from my
ram and he asks well he likes Sergey
Brin's presence in the class at the
beginning his guest appearance and he
wants to know if that'll be repeated
later on well I liked having Sergey in
the class as well Sergei is quite a busy
person he's running a company that you
may have heard it that has hundreds of
millions of people wanting their queries
responded to every day so he doesn't
have a lot of time to help us out with
the class there will be at least one
more appearance of Sergey somewhere
later in the course I won't tell you
where exactly now we will have lots of
appearances from other people that are
experts in search engines as well as
other areas of computing and those will
be scattered throughout the units as
well as will especially focus on that
putting computing in a broader context
in the last unit and we'll have lots of
interviews with interesting people in
that unit</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
