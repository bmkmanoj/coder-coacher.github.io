a vertex at negative 1 comma 3 excellent
work if you got this vertex correct in
order to find this vertex we need to
complete the square for these X terms
this x squared term has a coefficient of
negative 2 so i'm going to factor that
out from these two terms first in order
to complete the square so we'll have
negative 2 times x squared plus 2x plus
some unknown number now this number is
the number will use to complete the
square and the positive one we'll just
stay outside on the end the B value is
positive 2 so we know be divided by 2
equals 1 and B divided by 2 squared
equals 1 as well this means it will need
to add one in order to complete the
square for these terms but we really
didn't just add one here we really added
1 times negative 2 or a total of
negative 2 let's think about this in
terms of distribution we have negative
2x squared we have negative 4x and we
have negative 2 because we subtracted 2
from this equation we really need to add
2 to make sure that it's balanced we
really add 0 this is why we have to put
a positive 2 on the end of our equation
here now we're ready to rewrite this as
a perfect square that perfect square is
X plus 1 will still have negative 2 out
in front and we'll have positive 1 and
positive 2 added on the end this gives
us our equation in vertex form so we can
easily identify the vertex we set the
binomial equal to 0 to get an x value of
negative 1 and the k value or the y
quarter of the vertex is just 3 this is
how we get the vertex of negative one
comma 3 it's right here now to get the
other points let's use this a value of
negative 2 I can zoom in on my vertex
and then we can see we move one to the
left and one to the right and two units
down to get these other two points on
our parabola since this parabola is y
equals we know we need to move negative
2 down from the vertex
once you move one left and one right
this gives us our points of negative 21
and 0 comma 1 notice how the
y-coordinate here and here are two less
than the y-coordinate of the vertex here
this is why the a value is so important
when it comes to graphing parabolas it
makes our graphing much more simple</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
