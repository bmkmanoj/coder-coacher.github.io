nobody in the queue when I when I first
came and requested a lock but another
time I may not be that lucky there may
be somebody else using the lock already
and if that is the case then what I
would have to do is to queue myself in
this data structure and the way I do
that is to indicate by setting the last
pointer in this list to point to me this
point there is always pointing to the
last requester in this case the original
key that I showed you I was the only
requester that was also the last
requester but now the queue has somebody
using that particular lock and so when I
come in what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
set this field of the lock data
structure the dummy node the head node
of the lock data structure to point to
me and the last requester and I'm also
going to fix up the linked list so that
the current guy is gonna point to me why
am I doing this well the reason I do
this is because when he is done using
the lock he needs to reach out and
signal me what am I going to be doing
I'm gonna be spinning and what am i
spinning on I'm spinning on the guarded
flag so this is a data structure that is
associated with me and one of the fields
you know is the guarded field in the
data structure so I'm going to spin on
this guarded field in the data structure
waiting for this guy to set it to true
so I'll initialize it to false when I
came in and formed this request when I
formed this request what I did was to
set myself as a last requester I'll
clear out this field to indicate that I
don't have the lock and I'll set up the
linked list so that the current lock
holder points to me through his next
field and my next field of course is nil
because there's no requester after me so
once I have fixed up this linked list in
in this fashion then I basically can
spin on my guarded boolean variable</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
