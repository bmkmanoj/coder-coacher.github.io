to understand that these optimizations
are only meant for production sure you
could execute them all the time but it
would dramatically slowed down your
iterative build time and thus make life
editing a lot less powerful instead I
recommend to split your tasks into
development and production development
tasks contain things you really need no
matter what that's processing for
example and tasks I only make sensor
encoding for instance live editing
however keep in mind that while
developing this means you'll be using a
different version of your app than your
users it's going to look and feel mostly
the same but sometimes performance
issues or bugs only manifest with a
specific optimization technique so make
sure to always test the production
version from time to time in the next
couple of instructions will be creating
more generated assets previously the
only generated fights we were producing
where the CSS files but now we need to
create a structure to hold production
and development filed separately</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
