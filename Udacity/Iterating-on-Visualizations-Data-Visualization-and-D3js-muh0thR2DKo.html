painter goes through many iterations of
his or her final masterpiece going back
to reschedule changed canvases layer
paint etc the data visualization process
is not simply just the frosting on a
data analysis cake after has been baked
but a fundamental and integral part of
the process as a whole and while you may
read this graphic from left to right
each stage is often iterative and you'll
find yourself traversing this process in
a somewhat nonlinear fashion one step
may better inform what you have done in
a previous step for example maybe only
once you visualize your data that you
realize that there are way too many
points to make sense of and you need to
go back and filter and mine your data to
transform it into a new form that might
be much more easy to understand from a
visual perspective also you can imagine
some insight that you might discover in
an earlier stage that you might want to
incorporate in your final visualization
or some new data that you find online
that you think will add more context and
bolster the narrative you've created and
while data visualization in and of
itself is a very expansive discipline
ranging from interactive art
installations that data artists produce
to business analytical dashboards and
charts one of the running themes
throughout this course will be how to
best leverage the principles that we
learn about visualization theory
combined with technologies like d3 to
communicate our data and insights in the
most effective manner</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
