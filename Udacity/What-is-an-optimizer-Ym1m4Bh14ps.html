optimizers optimizers sound scary but
they're really cool and really fun I'm
going to show you all kinds of neat
things you can do with optimizers what
is an optimizer an optimizer is an
algorithm that can do the following
things optimizers can be used to find
minimum values for functions so say you
have a function like f of x equals x
squared plus X cubed plus 5 or something
like that an optimizer can find for what
value of x is this overall function
minimized
another thing that optimizers can do is
find the parameters for parameterised
models from data so we might have some
data from some experiment and we can use
optimizers to find a polynomial fit to
that data and that's actually one thing
we're going to learn in this lesson
finally we can use an optimizer to
refine allocations to stocks in
portfolios so what does that mean what
that means for instance you can decide
what percentage of funds should be
allocated to each stock using an
optimizer how do we use an optimizer
it's really just as simple as three key
steps first thing you need to do is
define a function that you want to
minimize as an example you might use
something like f of X is equal to x
squared plus 0.5 you define that in
Python and then the minimizer we'll call
this function many many times as it
tries to find the minimum value for X
that causes this function overall to be
smallest you also need to start with an
initial guess for X that you think might
be close to the solution to the problem
if you don't really know then you can
choose a random value or just some
standard value but then the optimizer
starts with that guess
and it repeatedly again it repeatedly
calls a function tests different values
and narrows in on the on the solution
finally you call the optimizer with
these parameters and stand back
while it searches for the minimum</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
