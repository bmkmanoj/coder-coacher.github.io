nodes condensed to only a few levels
while an unbalanced tree has nodes
spread out among many levels the most
extreme type of unbalanced tree is
really just a link list where every node
has only one child by that definition a
self-balancing tree is one that tries to
minimize the number of levels that it
uses it does some algorithm during
insertion and deletion to keep itself
balanced and the notes themselves might
have some additional properties the most
common example is a red black tree which
is an extension of a binary search tree
as is painfully common in computer
science the name turns out to be very
straightforward in this type of tree
nodes are assigned an additional color
property where the values must be either
red or black the use of color as red or
black is just a convention you really
just need a way to distinguish between
two different types of nodes the second
property of a red black tree is the
existence of null leaf nodes every node
in your tree that doesn't otherwise have
two leaves must have no children as you
can see all no leaf nodes must be
colored black next if a node is red both
of its children must be black there's an
additional optional rule the root node
must be black
lastly for the rule that makes these
trees actually useful every path from a
node to its descendant null nodes must
contain the same number of black nodes
will see these rules in action when we
talk about inserting for now know that
these rules and the last one in
particular assure that the tree never
gets too unbalanced</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
