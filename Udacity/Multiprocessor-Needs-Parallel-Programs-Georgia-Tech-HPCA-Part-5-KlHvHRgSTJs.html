multiprocessor can easily win in
performance nowadays assuming that you
have a program that can use multiple
cores so there are some disadvantages to
going to multi processors from single
core processors one is that the so
called sequential or single threaded
code is easier to develop for
programmers and actually it's a lot
easier to develop so there is
significant cost involved in making an
application multi-threaded where
originally it was single threaded even
when you do write a parallel application
you will have some bugs and debugging of
parallel code is much more difficult
than sequential code and even if you
have a program that works correctly and
uses a lot of threads
chances are that it will still be very
hard to get what is called performance
scaling and performance scaling is the
property of the program that as we
increase the number of cores if its
overall performance keeps improving this
would be ideal performance scaling you
get more performance in proportion to
the number of cores you are given
unfortunately most programs when you
write them do something like this the
scale for a while and then stop scaling
and eventually you stop getting more
performance from the number of course
you can spend a lot of time improving
this program and get something like this
where it scales up to some larger number
of cores reasonably well but each of
these increments in scaling is going to
result in a lot of work for you to
achieve it and very very few programs
achieve good scaling to a huge number of
course and those the dough usually took
years to develop</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
