address the issue of mutual suspicion
from fellow users as well as from the
server and fortunately AFIS fails the
second test and that is protecting the
user from the system there is no way to
protect the user from the system because
a user has to trust the system
everything is stored on this system so
in that sense there is no protection for
the user from the system itself it also
fails on the third attribute confinement
of resource usage for instance a given
user can make a lot of calls on the
server in other words they could consume
a lot of network bandwidth there's no
way to confine resource usage in the
Andrew file system and this can also be
the basis for denial of service attacks
if one malicious user or an errant
program that is running on the virtual
workstation starts generating a whole
bunch of network packets genuine network
packets directed at the server it can
inundate the network and prevent others
from getting useful work done so in
other words confinement of resource
usage is not something that is addressed
in the AFS system it passes the
authentication test we can validate in
both directions the client and the
server so the answer is yes on that one
the last attribute is the integrity of
the server remember that in the Andrew
system the assumption is that the
clients running on the virtual
workstation they communicate to vice
using unsecure links on the other hand
the server's themselves are inside in
some sense a firewall and therefore they
don't need any secure communication so
the links that are inside the server
network is assumed to be secure and
therefore there is no authentication or
encryption inside the server network
therefore if somebody were to somehow
get into that
they can create havoc so the only way
you can give server integrity in the
Andrew file system is by physically
enforcing who can get into those walls
of the server so physical and social
mores are the only way to secure the
integrity of the server's themselves so
I'm going to give it not a passing mark
on server integrity because by design
the server's are assumed to be in a
secure environment and that can be one
of the biggest sources of
vulnerabilities</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
