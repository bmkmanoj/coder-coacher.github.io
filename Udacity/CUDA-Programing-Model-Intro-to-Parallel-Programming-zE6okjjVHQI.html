parallelism adds to the CUDA programming
model so quite simply it lets you launch
kernels directly from inside another
kernel and that sound relatively simple
if you like it in and out the analogy on
the on the on the cpu side is when I
could create threads inside a process
instead of having to go back to the
operating system to initiate a new
process I could suddenly spawn a P
thread and do something asynchronously
within the single process that I have
managed that all from within my own
process I can now do that on the GPU as
well I can create work and not just
single threads I create whole grids from
inside of my GPU so if my problem is
working on something and I suddenly need
to invert a matrix or perform a Fourier
transform or something I can suddenly
just call out into an intimate kernel
which does that for me returns the data
and I can continue so I can embed
parallel work exactly where I need it
with the data that I have available and
inside my program sort of corollary to
that is this idea of being able to take
data that dynamically or working on a
value that you have a sort of mathematic
algorithmically generated and use that
value to make decisions on work you're
going to do so if I if my value is 1 do
this if it's to do that or maybe I am
partitioning a problem i'm building a
tree spatially partitioning something if
i have a certain number of things in one
place a larger number in another place i
can dynamically launch the correct
number of threads to do that and the
ability to do this on the fly
dynamically is is really the power of
this dynamic parallelism</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
