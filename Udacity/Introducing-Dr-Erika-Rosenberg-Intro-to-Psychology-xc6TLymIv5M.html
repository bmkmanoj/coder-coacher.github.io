Erica Rosenberg
and she's an expert in the psychology of
emotion and facial expression of emotion
so Erica can you tell us something about
how you got into this field of study
it's kind of interesting because it's
not something I thought I would do when
I was a kid that I would study facial
expressions of emotion but if you look
at my my baby pictures it might have
predicted this but I was interested in
the effects of emotions on health in
general I was interested in stress and
health I went to the University of
California San Francisco in their health
psychology program to get my PhD after
my first year I met Paul Ekman who was a
professor there and I found out he had
really developed this field of this
scientific study of facial expressions
of emotion so that's how I started
working on it
I saw the face as a tool to learn to
measure emotion from a purely research
point of view but once I got into it it
led to this whole series of fascinating
applications for studying the face well
can you tell us something about what was
some of the groundbreaking work that was
done right all right I mean its interest
in the face in studying emotion actually
goes pretty far back it started in the
19th century when Charles Darwin
published a book you know in 1872 called
the expression of the emotions and man
and animals where he he had all these
wonderful drawings and photographs of
animals and humans a lot of the pictures
were of his kids making different
emotion faces and he was trying to make
the argument that there's something
fundamental about how emotion is shown
not just in humans but an aviary of
animal species that is sort of inborn
innate and he had he did very informal
research methods of having people all
over the world send him pictures from
their journeys or drawings at the time
as saying if you show these pictures to
people do they recognize him as the same
ones we do in his anecdotal evidence
we're pretty consistent that there was a
small set of emotions that are conveyed
with certain facial actions that's
consistent for all humans in the world
all over the world and his research
methods were not real precise in the
early 20th century this idea of things
being inborn was not very popular
behaviorism was just getting going and
it took until the the 1960s actually
when Ekman and Friesen did their
pioneering work not just to other
industrialized nations because they
found some agreement consistent with
Darwin's in industrialized countries but
they decided if you really want to find
out if something's innate not learned
then you have to go to cultures where
they're not sharing the kind of
information that we share in
industrialized nations so he went with
an anthropologist friend to Papua New
Guinea which at that time no longer was
a preliterate culture they didn't have
exposure to any Western films or
whatever and Ekman and Friesen showed
members of two different tribes they're
some of the photographs they'd used of
certain poses of facial expression of
emotion but most of those people were
you know European American looking
people so they also gathered photos from
the New Guineans themselves and use a
variety of different methodologies and
surprised both Ekman because if you
expect to find this and a scientific
community that there were about five or
six different emotions for which the
facial configurations were consistently
recognized the same both in you know at
the time Eckman was in Berkeley Berkeley
California and in Papua New Guinea so
that seemed to speak very powerfully to
the idea that there were Universal
facial expressions of emotion but this
was a small set so we're talking about
anger fear disgust happiness sadness and
surprise about six emotions
Kumada these universal expressions I'm
gonna need to take my glasses off now
the important thing to remember is that
these are prototypes so like any
prototype this is sort of like a classic
just like a an apples a classic fruit
and there's other fruits that are not
you know is typical this is sort of the
prototypical example of each of these
emotions that I'm going to show you so
I'll start with anger anger the brows
are lowered the upper eyelid is lifted
the lower eyelid is tense and the lips
are pressed together so I can't talk
while I do that so I'll do this
that's anger this is disgust so a key
sign of disgust is the wrinkling of the
nose fear happiness sadness and surprise
and this is an emotion that later work
has suggested is likely to be universal
or at least has some good cross-cultural
agreement and that's the emotion of
contempt which is the only of the set of
universals that is only really a
unilateral or an asymmetrical expression
that's contempt so but contempt wasn't
one of the emotions they used in the
early work</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
