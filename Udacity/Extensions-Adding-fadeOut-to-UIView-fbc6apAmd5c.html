to enable a view to fade out and fade
back in for this demo we'll be looking
at a really simple Xcode project go
ahead and download it from the link in
the instructors notes and then open the
project in Xcode it's called fade
extension demo in this left panel the
project navigator click on the view
controller file and then look for the
Sun rise and set method here inside Sun
rise and set you can see that i'm using
the method animate with duration to fade
out an image view this animation changes
the views alpha value from 120 over the
duration that I pass in as a parameter
here this one is one second there's also
a delay parameter so we could pass in a
delay if we wanted under the options
parameter you'll see we've passed in
curve ease in this makes it so that the
animation starts out slow and speeds up
towards the end for the completion
parameter I'm passing in some code that
changes the image and then fades the
view back in here's the code that
changes the image after the image is
changed we're using animate with
duration again to fade the view back in
you can see that this code for fading
the view back in is identical to the
code that fades it out apart from the
alpha value and the completion parameter
the syntax around this completion
parameter is pretty tricky so don't
worry if it doesn't make sense right now
we'll talk more about completion blocks
in the next lesson on closures I want to
focus on another problem with this code
soon I'll have another view that I'd
like to fade out and fade back in and I
know I'd have to rewrite this code that
goes against my dry programming
principles but if I put this code in an
extension I can reuse it so let's do
that since I can't add an extension
directly to the UI views Swift file I'll
make a new swift file and call it uiview
extensions to add a file to the project
I just control click on one of these
folders over here in the project
navigator and then I go to new file then
I want a swift file and again i'm going
to call it uiview extensions
here we are in the UI view extension
Swift file and the first thing you'll
need to do is import UI kit to define an
extension you just write the word
extension followed by the name of the
type you're extending and in between
curly braces the methods you'd like to
add the methods we'd like to add or
called fade out and fade in here in the
fade-out method we just want to copy and
paste some of the code from that Sun
rise and set method so to do that we go
back to our view controller dot Swift
file and then we want to copy this fade
out code this animate with duration code
up to but not including the completion
block once you've got animate with
duration paste it in there are a couple
snippets of code we need to edit here
where it says self image view alpha we
want to replace that with self alpha
because the object that's calling this
code self is the object whose alpha
needs to change next we need to make
sure we're passing in the necessary
parameters so we'll pass the parameters
duration delay and the completion
closure into the fade-out method and
then we'll pass those parameters again
to the animate with duration method so
here instead of one second we'll put
duration here instead of a delay of 0
seconds we'll put delay and then under
completion will put completion notice
that the animation option curvy Zin is
the same every time fade out is called
and so is the animation changing the
alpha 20</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
