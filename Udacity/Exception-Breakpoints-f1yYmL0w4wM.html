with what are known as line break points
we created these by clicking in the
gutter on the line of code where we
wanted to pause the execution of our
application but Xcode gives us options
to create other types of useful
breakpoints that are not associated with
any single particular line of code to
create them we'll need to go to the
break point navigator and I'll remove
this break point for now and then we'll
want to focus our attention on this plus
sign in the lower left hand corner if we
click it a context menu appears allowing
us to add exception breakpoints OpenGL
ES breakpoints symbolic breakpoints and
a test failure breakpoint in this course
we're going to focus on only the
exception and symbolic breakpoints
because the other two OpenGL and test
failure are more specialized cases so
let's add an exception breakpoint and
see what happens the first thing that we
can see is that Xcode creates a
breakpoint that does not belong to any
single file and it reads all exceptions
and show the difference I'll set a line
breakpoint you can see how this one
belongs to a file and this one does not
so like it sounds this breakpoint can be
triggered by any and all exceptions if
we right click and edit this breakpoint
we can see that the break option is set
to on throw thus anytime the runtime
environment throws an exception this
breakpoint will be hid we could change
this to on catch but let's leave this
setting for now to demonstrate how this
breakpoints used I'll go to the break
point bug View controller let's scroll
up to the viewdidload and we'll change
the action for the single tap recognizer
from handle single tap to handle single
taps with an S because we know that that
method does not exist and this will
force an exception to be thrown so let's
run the application and we'll tap in the
breakpoint debugging scene
so once I've tapped the screen we can
see that our breakpoint is being reached
and it's saying that an unrecognized
selector is being sent to the instance
of a memory address for a breakpoint bug
view controller and if I try to continue
then our application will crash and it's
terminating on a uncaught exception of
in s exception type
so let's go ahead and look at the other
options we have I'll stop for the
exception breakpoint so the only thing
that's different
besides the action and options which
we've seen before is this exception
option and we can set it for a
particular language like Objective C and
C++ so that we only fire on exceptions
triggered in either language and that's
really it for exception breakpoints and
you may be wondering to yourself well
how is an exception breakpoint useful
well this type of breakpoint can be
extremely useful if your application is
crashing on a particular line of code
but Xcode and the stack trace really
just aren't giving you a whole lot of
information so with an exception
breakpoint you can pause right before
the app crashes because say it's not
handling the exception and then
determine who is the culprit of the
crash</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
