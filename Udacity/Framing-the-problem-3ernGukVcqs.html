for sharp ratio so solving that problem
is not trivial but it's not too hard
either what we need to do is frame the
portfolio optimization problem as a
minimization problem and then we can
solve it using the tools you have
already as you recall in order to use a
optimizer that minimizes we have to do
three things first we have to provide a
function to minimize f of X that takes
in X to an initial guess for that X and
3 call the optimizer and let it run now
in this case X are the allocations that
we're looking for and we want the
optimizer to try different allocations
in order to discover the best set of
allocations that optimizes this function
well what is that function exactly we
said just a moment ago that we want to
optimize for Sharpe ratio so is this
just Sharpe ratio well not exactly
because what the minimizer will do in
this case is try to find the smallest
Sharpe ratio so it'll find allocations
that minimize that and we want of course
the largest Sharpe ratio because larger
Sharpe ratios are better that's easy to
fix all we do is multiply this by a
negative 1 so all that we want our
optimizer to do is optimize for a
negative Sharpe ratio and that'll find
the best allocation or the best value
for X to solve this problem and remember
X can have multiple dimensions so each
dimension of X here is an allocation to
each of the stocks so if we're trying to
solve for a portfolio of for stocks X
will have 4 dimensions and the value for
each of those dimensions is the
percentage of funds to allocate to each
of those stocks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
