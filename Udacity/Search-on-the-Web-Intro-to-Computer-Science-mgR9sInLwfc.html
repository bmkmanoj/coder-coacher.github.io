need to build a search engine but what
are they missing well a few thousand of
these we're standing in front of the
Google server this is a web server but
it's using Ethernet to connect these
different boards which are actually
separate computers that they put
together these are just generic pcs
because you can run a search engine at
home on one computer but it's not going
to have a very big end of it how many
are we talking about tens many many many
thousand Google was not a particularly
well-known one in its early years mostly
search engines today we think of them as
being incredibly wealthy companies at
the time they were mostly losing money
they had venture capital spent money in
that they basically didn't make enough
money from selling ads to pay pay their
bills search engines actually go back
before the web
on the internet there were several
search engines the closest to what we
have today might be ways done in the
late 80s and that lets you search
different servers over the internet then
we have for instance CERN virtual
library which was done by Tim
berners-lee the main eventer web but
that wasn't really like a modern search
engine it was more like a library card
catalog we had categories early Yahoo
was like that as well the one that got
the most recognition was Alta Vista and
this was kind of like the Google of its
day in the late 90s one that was a
little bit different was asked Jeeves
which was a search engine but it was
also meant to be natural language query
so you can say like what's the capital
of Spain and it would give you the
answer
Google borrowed an idea from a little
search engine called goto.com which was
to not just have ads but to sell the
search terms themselves so like when you
go to Google now and you see the
sponsored results those are actual terms
related to what you're searching for
they're also ads and that just took up
when people really responded to that and
that actually brought the entire search
industry from on its way down to being
one less profitable part
