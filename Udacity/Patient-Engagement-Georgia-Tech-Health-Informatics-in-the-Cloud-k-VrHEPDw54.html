providers patient engagement is a key
strategy for preventing and managing
diseases patients in a 2010 survey by
the California Health Foundation
reported that access to their data
improve their care those using a
specific tool a personal health record
reported they knew more about their
health they asked their physician a
question they would not otherwise have
asked they felt more connected to their
physician and they actually did
something to improve their health
however the survey also showed that
patient adoption is still low with only
one in 14 having used a PHR and adopters
are predominantly young highly educated
I earn income patients a big part of the
reason seems to be patient concerns
about privacy and security of their
health data sixty-eight percent of the
respondents said they are very or
somewhat concerned about misuse of their
digital health data keep in mind that p
hrs our cloud-based web tools so it's
likely than any well-publicized problems
with data misuse on the internet
translates in increased patient concerns
about health data being stored there at
least partially as a result a 2012
survey showed that only twenty-six
percent of patients want their medical
records to be digital with eighty-five
percent expressing privacy and security
concerns</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
