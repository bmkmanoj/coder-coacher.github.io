course I think in lesson three structure
is function not only for proteins in our
cells but also in the world of
pharmacology
remember that drugs bind to proteins in
your cells and in your body and if a
protein has even a slight change in its
conformation or structure it will likely
change its ability to interact with the
drug or the speed with which it can
interact with the drug structural
variation in pharmacodynamic proteins
affects the target effects of a drug for
example the drug here in red binds the
receptor here in this Y shaped
conformation when it binds there's a
normal activity that happens a target
effect if you will but if we have a
variation in the structure of this
receptor now the drug can't bind to it
in the same way so the activity turns
out to be reduced a genetic variation
that altered the structure of the
protein resulted in a functional change
for the drug structural variation in
pharmacokinetic proteins affects the
speed with which a drug is metabolized
or broken down in this case the drug is
in red being metabolized by the purple
protein into these two smaller
metabolites this would be our normal
drug metabolism but we could have a
variant over here that changed the
structure of the enzyme that breaks down
the drug and now there's a reduced
activity or no drug metabolism at all
let's see if you can pull on the
information we've learned about up to
this point in the lesson what do you
think would result from a structural
change of the GABA receptor causing an
increase and the pharmacodynamic
efficiency to bind alcohol and a
structural change of alcohol
dehydrogenase or ADH causing a decrease
in pharmacokinetic efficiency of alcohol
metabolism would you expect extreme
intoxication moderate intoxication or
minimal intoxication remember this time
we're combining what we know about the
pharmacodynamic and the pharmacokinetic
pathways at one time to see the overall
effect of the drug on your whole system
or your body</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
