worry about is the problem of state
estimation and as we were just talking
about a couple of moments ago we can
make a pom VP into a kind of MDP by
expanding out the state space what we're
gonna do is consider what we call belief
States so the state that the decision
maker is going to use in in the context
of a pom DP is going to be a belief
state B and what a belief state B gives
you is that if you tell me a state like
s belief state B of s tells us the
probability that we're actually in state
s at the current moment of time so B is
this sort of like a state well it's a
belief state so it's like what we did in
the last example it's it's kind of a
vector it's a distribution over States
yes exactly it's a probability
distribution over States yes and so and
that's going to that's going to encode
for us it's going to retain for us the
information about the history that might
be important for decision-making okay so
it gets us all the way back to the
beginning okay so be a vest then so B is
just a vector and it's indexed by s and
s instead of being an integer is just a
state right what could that work so it's
a probability distribution all right
that makes sense
okay so now what we need to do is figure
out how this belief state gets updated
as we take actions in the world okay so
we're gonna think about that is we're in
some belief state we choose an action
the world gives us back an observation
and we need now a new belief state to be
formed from that okay so that's that's
exactly parallel to the we were in a
state we took an action and we got into
another state right so what we really
are doing here is we're building up a
notion of a belief MDP so it's going to
its we're gonna turn the pom DP into a
kind of MDP specifically the belief MDP
where the states of the belief MVP are
probability distributions over states of
the underlying MVP in the pom BB okay
sounds good so an aside Michael is if
reward is a function of state which it
sometimes is I've often so you should be
able to use that to update your belief
state right so in what we're going to be
talking about the reward is essentially
not observed but of course in reality if
you have a learner that's in some
environment and it's making observations
and getting some reward back it can
actually and if it knows something about
how that
reward is being generated it can use
that as a kind of observation and so we
can essentially assume that the
observation has whatever information
might be in the reward in it right so in
fact the observation is whatever sub
features you get to see plus the reward
yeah I've seen some people write it this
way where you say that the reward is
actually something about the observable
you can you know all the reward you get
is extracted from what you up what you
observe and so anything that you model
in the pom DP as being reward relevant
has to actually show up in the
observation right otherwise you kind of
can't learn if you can't observe it
right that makes perfect sense all right
so what we need to do is derive how we
get this probability distribution over
States B Prime from the old belief state
the action the observation and whatever
quantities in the pom DP that we have so
what we need to figure out is in this
new belief state after we've taken
action a and seen observation Z what is
the probability that we're in state s
prime and so we're gonna have to do some
kind of probabilistic you know I guess
inference our derivation to work that
out sure we ought to be able to do that
right because we have all the quantities
that we need in the pom TP I think well
that's the hope so we want the
probability of the next state given that
we're in a belief state took an action
and made an observation
so can we manipulate this expression
using the laws of probability to make
sense out of it sure</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
