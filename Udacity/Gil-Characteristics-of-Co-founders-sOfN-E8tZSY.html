startups fail is disagreements occur
among co-founders so you really want to
find someone that you want to work with
for the long haul clearly you want
someone you get a long way that
complements you but I've seen a few
things that sometimes get overlooked one
is the risk profile what does that mean
it means if you're an entrepreneur and
you're one way to go out there without
finding is nine to twelve months you
want to find a co-founder that shares
that same longevity without funding
because if your co-founder only has
three months to go without funding that
will create a sticky situation down the
world so yes look for those traits of
getting along and wanting to work well
but look at the risk profile as well
look at how long you and your
co-founders can go and be aligned with
that before you start the journey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
