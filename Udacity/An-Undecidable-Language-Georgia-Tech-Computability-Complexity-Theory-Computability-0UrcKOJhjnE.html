to turning machines will let M 1 M 2 etc
be the set of all Turing machines Turing
machines can be described with strings
so there are a countable number of them
and so we can enumerate them like this
and we'll create a table as before I'll
define the function f IJ to be one if
machine eye accepts the description of
machine J and we'll define it as zero
otherwise
for this example I'll fill out the table
somehow the actual values aren't
important right now now consider the
language L consisting of string
descriptions of machines that do not
accept their own descriptions and let's
add a Turing machine which we'll call ml
that recognizes this language to the
grid well again we run into a problem
this row is supposed to have the
opposite values of what's along the
diagonal but what about the diagonal
element of this row what does the
machine do when it's given its own
description if it accepts itself then ml
is not in the language so ml should not
have accepted itself on the other hand
if ml does not accept it string
representation then ml is in a language
so ml should have accepted its string
representation thankfully in
computability the resolution to this
paradox isn't as hard to see as it is in
set theory or mathematical logic we just
conclude that the supposed machine ml
that recognizes the language L doesn't
exist here it is natural to object well
of course it exists I just run m1 itself
and if it doesn't accept we accept the
problem is that m1 itself might loop or
it might just run for a really long time
and there's no way to tell the
difference the end result then is that
the language L of string descriptions of
machines that did not accept their own
descriptions is not recognizable recall
that in order for a language to be
decidable both the language and its
compliment have to be recognizable since
l is not recognizable it's also not
decidable and neither is its complement
that is the language for the machine
does accept its own description we'll
call this D TM D standing for diagonal
these facts are the foundation for
everything that we will argue in this
lesson so make sure that you understand
all these claims</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
