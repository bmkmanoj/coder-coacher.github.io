needed to complete the garbled circuit
protocol the way Bob obtains his inputs
is using oblivious transfer and that
could be done at this stage to enable
Bob to learn his inputs to the circuit
allisyn's the garbled circuit along with
her inputs Bob can evaluate the circuit
and then from the encrypted output wires
Bob can obtain the result of the circuit
execution and he could share that with
Alice or they could flip roles and do it
again and then Alice would obtain the
output we have one little step in this
protocol that we haven't described yet
which is how you actually obtain that
output value the outputs for the garble
tables are all encrypted so at the end
of the execution what Bob has is a list
of encrypted wire labels he wants to
turn that into semantic output that's
left as a question for the exam I should
note that actually executing protocols
like this doing all these encryptions is
really expensive this works for any
function but it's very expensive it's a
very active research area how to do this
faster this is one of the things my
research group works on as well as lots
of other researchers to try to find ways
to provide properties like the one
described here but without as much
computation effort as executing the
protocol that I've just described</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
