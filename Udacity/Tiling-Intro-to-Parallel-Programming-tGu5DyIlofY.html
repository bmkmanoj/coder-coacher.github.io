tiling now often multiple threads are
more generally multiple computational
tasks we'll need to access overlapping
parts of a data structure Stratton uses
the term tiling to refer to buffering
data on too fast on chip storage where
it will be repeatedly accessed now this
is an old old idea and on the CPU it
generally means sizing the data accessed
by a program so that it will fit
naturally into the CPU cores on chip
cache there's an implicit copy going on
between the locations in DRAM and the
fast on chip storage in this case the
cache another way to do it is to
explicitly allocate some of this fast
memory to be used as a scratch pad and
on the GPU in CUDA this is what we call
shared memory and then we can have a set
of threads that do the explicit copy
pulling memory in from DRAM explicitly
laying it out in the scratchpad memory
in the shared memory just the way we
want it where then will operate on it
it's worth emphasizing GPUs run so many
threads that the amount of cache per
thread is limited so this style of cache
blocking which is what you call this
technique on the CPU isn't so great for
the GPU a better approach is to
explicitly copy data that will be reused
by the threads in a thread block into
the fast shared memory that's available
and set aside for that block let's have
a quiz which of the following two code
snippets would benefit from tiling the
first snippet averages values from five
arrays the second averages five values
from one array</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
