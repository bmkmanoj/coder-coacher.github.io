of the kind that occurred with the
earthquake story we need a new knowledge
representation called a thematic role
system automatically is a type frame
system where the frame represents an
action or event identified by a verb the
verb calls for the number of
expectations about the roles that are
connected with that particular event
David can you think of an example of the
thematic role frame so one simple
example that comes to mind for me is the
word throw I noted if I throw action has
taken place a few things have to be in
play I expect there to be someone doing
the throwing I expect something to be
thrown I might expect a target specified
by the word at or a destination
specified by the word to so for example
I throw the ball to Ashok or I throw the
ball at Ashok depending on how nice I'm
feeling note that even though David
isn't talking about a specific instance
of throwing he's still able to generate
the expectations with the general action
of throwing this is what a thematic case
frame does for you it is able to
generate expectations let us look at how
it would actually work in action</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
