data team at Udacity and it's our job to
measure and support your success in the
classroom by looking at the study habits
of our graduated students we've
identified a few simple strategies that
will help you succeed study for an hour
at it soon to graduate courses spend
about an hour per day three to four days
a week in the classroom what does this
mean for you push on an hour every day
to study and reward yourself at the end
of it with the knowledge that you're a
little bit smarter when you finish every
little bit counts
you know that time you waste sitting on
the bus or waiting around the doctor's
office take advantage of that time I
know that about half of Udacity
graduates use it on their mobile devices
what does this mean for you make every
minute count use the desk mobile app and
get a little smarter all the time
quizzes matter
we love quizzing you and for good reason
as soon as you graduate Udacity courses
tend to spend about as much time working
on quizzes as they did watching videos
why because getting better takes
practice we know that you learn best by
doing so do as much as you can failure
is okay trihard try off in and you'll
eventually succeed let's talk a little
bit more about programming quizzes
students who graduated from the intro to
Hadoop and MapReduce course press the
test button on average about 11 times
per quiz and the spit button on average
about two and a half times per quiz what
does this mean for you think about what
you're doing test ideas and don't be
afraid to fail collect data iterate and
do it better next time what are you
waiting for start learning on Udacity
