Michael so do you I'm gonna work it
through sure so what I did first as I
made it I extended the table that you
had okay so include each of these the
output for each of these three functions
what I'm basically what I'd like to do
is compute the squared error for each of
these three functions on that data and
then choose the one that has the lowest
squared error make first since I mean
sounds good enough to be an algorithm so
you want me to write out the table well
I mean so I started to do that and then
it was like one too many steps i just
threw up my hands and just wrote a
program okay so we'll just say you know
insert code here so that's what you did
that was the steps and what did your
code tell you well let me let me start
with the constant function because
that's the easiest piece of code so I'm
saying what's the difference between
each of the D values and to squaring
them all and summing it up and I get 19
okay the minute of 19 19 19 exactly and
four and then I can do the same thing
instead of using two i can use x over 3
take the difference of that to the D
values and square that and I get 19.4
Wow 444444 then I can do right so now at
this point I'm rock and roll and I can
actually just substitute it in mod nine
and I get 12 not not something mod 12 no
just 12 yeah so the error is 12 so that
has the smallest error so even though
that's sort of a crazy like stripey
function right like it increases
linearly and then it resets at nine
mm-hmm it actually fits this day to the
best that is correct your code is
correct Michael well done well actually
by looking at this data that sort of
makes sense to me right because if you
look at the first three examples of the
data the outputs are very close but the
outputs of the next three are much
bigger and by doing a mod nine which you
effectively do is say this is the
identity function above this line and
then below the line it's as if I'm sort
of subtracting 9 from all of them and
that makes them closer together and so
it just happens to work out here but
surely that's just because we came up
with a bad constant function and a bad
linear function do you think there's a
better linear function so I mean because
it's the squared error we're really just
talking about linear regression so I can
just run linear regression so I get an
intercept
of point nine five eight eight and an
and a slope of 0 point 1647 okay so I so
that's my linear function of choice okay
so that's what was that again so x times
you know it's like a six i guess like
point 165 call it Oh point one six five
x plus OH point nine five nine so that's
our function that's our best linear
function the function that minimizes
greater to better end opinion it better
end up being blessed in 19.4 or I'm a
liar mm-hmm and now I need to take the
difference between that and d square it
and some 15.7 hmm so that gives you 15
mm SI 15.8 so that is better yeah so
it's better than the x over 3 but it's
also worse than the mod nine hmm and the
best constant function has to be worse
because the linear functions include the
constant functions as a subset so this
is that 15.8 is better than the best
constant function 20 what's easy to do
though right because the best constant
functions just the mean of the data what
is the minute it 2.17 huh to is pretty
close yeah that's interesting well
that's in the middle of the pack i guess
it sort of works right because to the
error 42 was actually lower than the
error 4x divided by 3 and for what it's
worth the error for 2.17 as a constant
function or 2.2 is 8.8 18.8 18.8 sorry
near about the word remember yeah it
would have been less than everything
okay so what do we learned here that
sometimes you want to use mod yeah if
your data is weird you have definitely
modified my thoughts ah I'm glad you
found it mod mmm puns okay good so I
think that was a good that was knows a
good exercise so I'm gonna give you one
more example of deriving something and
then we're gonna move on cool okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
