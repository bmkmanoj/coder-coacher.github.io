debatable but I think you will all agree
that this one here is actually super
easy to solve shortest path on because
let's say you start here this is your
mail station where you start you go all
the way here and then you have no other
choice but to go here because you have
to visit all those vertices and then you
go back so there's not really any
difficult choices that you have to make
when you solve shortest paths for this
one here now this one here is a little
bit harder let's say it doesn't really
matter where you start out because for a
tour you can start out at any point
because you have to come back to it
anyway let's say you start out here and
then you go up here and then you already
have your first choice to make so do you
go this way or you do it that way well
probably you want to go that way way but
actually there are certain distances
where you also might want to go this way
so you have to make a choice here let's
say we go this way and here we have to
make a choice again so do we go this way
and back here or do we go this way and
here so a little bit harder to solve
because we have to make certain choices
but still not quite as hard as this one
over here which I would think is the
hardest because say we start out here Oh
first choice to make this way or that
way
oh that way Oh again you choice this way
or that way let's go that way so all the
time we have to make choices
which city to visit next and this is
really tough so what does this have to
do with what I just call distance from
triviality so what does this have to do
with what I just call distance from
triviality if I mark the vertices in
each of the networks if I mark the
vertices in each of the graphs that has
more than two neighbors then here we
have just one here we already have a
couple of them and this one also
although this one is fairly easy but
let's be consistent here and here I have
a lot of them and I'll give you one
additional graph which looks something
like this
now this has a bit fewer vertices but
that's not the point here the point is
that this graph down here doesn't have
any vertices that I would color because
all vertices have exactly two neighbors
and this here is what I would call a
trivial instance for shortest paths
because you don't really have to make
any choices where you want to go here
you also don't have to make any choices
but what you see here is that number
vertices that have more than two
neighbors actually is an indicator of
how hard it is to solve shortest tour on
that respective graph if you have a few
of these blue vertices here that have
more than two neighbors then it's easier
to solve
this tour now I cannot give you the
precise algorithm for this here because
actually that is a bit more complicated
to figure out and it doesn't only have
to do with these blue vertices here but
I think you get the intuition that we
could try to use the number of these
blue vertices or some additional
structural information as a parameter
and it turns out that if you do this the
right way then shortest tour is somewhat
fixed parameter tractable</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
