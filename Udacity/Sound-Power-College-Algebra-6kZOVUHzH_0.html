in the course and now we're going to
talk about something that's measured in
a very similar way surprisingly this is
sound sound is also measured on a
logarithmic scale and we can use this
equation to help us out this says L 1
equals 10 times log base 10 of P over B
now here B is some reference value it's
just a constant that we're going to
eliminate eventually so we don't need to
worry about what it's actually equal to
the two variables we have are important
though p is what is known as the power
of the sound and l here or I'm calling
it l1 in this case is a measure of the
sound level this is basically comparing
the sound power P to B now you may have
heard about different sounds being
dangerous to our hearing and this
equation can actually help us quantify
that L here is measured in decibels or
DB and looking at the decibel ratings of
different sounds it seems like a pretty
small increase in the number of decibels
actually amounts to a pretty big
increase in potential damage so why is
this well let's look at a few other
questions to figure this out so if the
original sound power that we're talking
about is P as written in this equation
but all you need to use in its place if
we wanted to talk about a sound with
double that power</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
