a lead financial systems analyst I have
three daughters my middle daughter has a
son he is two they spend a lot of time
here and really make the house
interesting to be in
right after college I was looking for
work that basically would pay the bills
because I had a family to take care of
it was kind of hard to figure out what
we could do and how we were going to
keep things going because we didn't know
I was seeking a job that would allow me
to have a career but unfortunately most
of the jobs that I started with didn't
have that potential it wasn't until I
got to 18 that I felt like I could
actually create a career I went into the
nanodegree to increase my skills to try
and make me better at the job that I do
after the nanodegree I was able to
actually obtain a promotion
I'm very positive that I can continue to
go forward in my work and keep my career
on track I enjoy what I do and it allows
me to earn the money that helps me to
get my family going</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
