square and then turn a little bit to the
right and then draw another square then
turn a little bit to the right again and
then draw another square and keep doing
that let's build that so here's the
piece of code that draws a square and
after I've done that what I want the
total to do is turn a little bit to the
right so let me add a piece of code that
says Brad dot right let's say by 10
degrees
now because I want these two statements
to happen over and over again I will put
them inside a loop so let me do that so
I'm going to add a for loop by saying
for I in range let's say this loop runs
4 times I'll add a colon and then put
these two things inside the loop let me
save and run and see what happens
aha so here's the output we've drawn two
squares three squares and it should stop
there it is
four squares so all I have to do now is
to let the total keep going around the
circle which has 360 degrees so this
loop should run not four times but 36
times instead let me save and run that
alright there it is folks a circle made
out of squares now I'm going to put some
background music behind this video and
let you enjoy our final creation</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
