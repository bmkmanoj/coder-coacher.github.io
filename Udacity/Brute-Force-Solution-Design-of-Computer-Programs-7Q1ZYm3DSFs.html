up a solver for these types of problems
and that design would be to write down
all the rules of arithmetic in terms of
carry digits in terms of odd and even
and so on now that seems like a
challenging task there's a lot of
complexity involved in understanding all
the rules about arithmetic and even if
we figured out everything about addition
there's also some subtraction and
multiplication and other operators and
so what we really want is a shortcut
that will allow us to eliminate this
complexity so let's go back to the back
of the envelope and see if we can figure
out a shortcut and one possibility would
be to try all possibilities there are 10
digits and so all combinations of digits
all permutations of the digits rather
would be only 10 factorial which I
happen to know is about 3 million and
that's not so many so it seems like it's
feasible for us to try all the
possibilities it's not going to be super
quick we would rather have this be
thousands rather than millions because
there seems to be a fair amount of work
in substituting in all the letters with
digits but we can expect to be able to
try all millions in not within a second
but within about a minute or so so now
we have an improved design which is we
represent our formula as a string and
we'll use official Python notation here
with the double equal sign and then we
fill in with all permutations of the ten
digits for each of the letters and if
there's fewer letters where we have to
account for that and so for example we
might substitute a one for the O's and a
two for the DS
and a three for the ease and a four for
the v's and a five for the ends and
otherwise just copy the equation and
then evaluate that and check if that's
equal to true and if it is then we have
a solution if it's not we'll go back and
we'll try another combination maybe 133
and so on we'll keep on going through
until we find some permutation that
works so that's the design now let's
take an inventory of all the concepts
we're going to need first we have
equations and there's two types of those
the original and the filled in the
original has letters the filled-in has
digits letters and digits our concepts
we have to deal with and the assignment
of a letter to a digit or set of those
is also a concept we have to deal with
and I think that's pretty much it maybe
one more concept is evaluation or
validation that the filled-in equation
is an accurate one so now let's come up
with some choices to represent each of
these concepts so the original equation
can be a string the filled in equation
can also be a string the letters will be
single character strings like D the
digits also be single character strings
like three the assignment of letters two
digits will be some sort of a mapping or
a table that has consists of this type
of mapping that says d would be replaced
by three and so on and it turns out that
there is a facility built into Python
that's part of strings called the
translate function so we can call the
string translate method in order to
enact that type of assignment or
substitution and then for the evaluation
there's a function called eval in Python
which takes a string and evaluates it as
an expression you may not be that
familiar with these last two items so
let's go over them the val is pretty
simple if we asked for a Val of the
string 2 plus 2 then that would give us
a value for and if we asked for eval of
the string two plus two equals three
Python would evaluate that using its
normal rules and tell us that that's
equal to false</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
