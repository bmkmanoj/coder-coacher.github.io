important addition to state machines
that Harrell offers is concurrency in
this case concurrency is indicated by a
dashed line
it separates a larger round tangle into
two other machines but in this case it
is a nesting that goes on at the same
time that is we've cranked up to
machines that are running each can have
their current state each can respond to
transitions and each each can perform
actions and depending upon the
transitions okay once again this reduces
the total number of states from a
multiplicative combination to an
additive combination here's from
Harrell's paper on the left is the bowl
of spaghetti that indicates the
multiplicative combination notice the
labels of the states are really
indicating where you would be in one of
the concurrent machines and where you
would be in the other concurrent machine
hard to understand what's going on there
Harel has replaced this this jumble by
one major state labeled Y and left two
of the original states H and I to
interact with it
the Y state has that dashed line
indicating concurrent actions that are
taking place they correspond to states a
and D they each have default States they
each have their own transitions but
hopefully you can see it's a little bit
easier to to follow what's going on
there notice also that her L allows the
splitting of a transition to go to two
possible states one in each of the
concurrent arms so the lower right State
in the rightmost diagram I has an e
transition coming out of it that's then
split into two into two places there's
also an example of a data condition in
here as well in UML the concurrency
looks like the following there are two
states here there's an idle State and a
maintenance State the maintenance State
has
the dash line in this case it's a
horizontal line and two concurrently
executing machines one called testing
and one called commanding each of which
are quite quite simple
each has initial state and a final state
and some transitions between them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
