able to apply in lots of different
settings when we have infinite
hypothesis classes and this is really
the fundamental way that it's used it's
a usually there's kind of a more
technical sounding definition this
notion of labeling in all possible ways
is usually termed shattering so this
quantity that we're talking about here
this this size of the largest set of
inputs that the hypothesis space can
shatter is called the VC dimension
what does be if you stand for VC stands
for vapnik chair Venantius which is a
pair of actual people so you know really
smart insightful guys that put together
this notion of a definition and what
they did is they can relate the VC
dimension of a class to the amount of
data that you need to be able to learn
effectively in that class so as long as
this dimensionality is finite even if
the hypothesis class is infinite we're
going to be able to say things about how
much data we need to learn so that's
that's really cool it really connects
things up beautifully so I think what
would be a really useful exercise now is
to look at various kinds of hypothesis
classes and for us to measure the VC
dimension okay sounds like fun</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
