worst case is that an element has to
move all the way from one side of the
array to the other side of the array so
the example here is the number 5 it
starts at the far left and then has to
travel all the way to the right so how
quickly does one item move its maximum
speed is moving one position per step
since the best it can do is swap with
its neighbor and move only one position
away so it takes on the order of n steps
to get from one side to the other and
how much work does it do per step well
on every step if we have n items then
we're going to do in over two
comparisons so in total we do order n
steps and order in work per step
totalling order of N squared over all
this is not a particularly efficient
sort we'd like to be able to do better
than order of N squared steps that being
said it's kind of a neat parallel
algorithm because we can see that within
a step each one of these comparisons can
proceed completely in parallel so at
least even though this isn't the most
efficient algorithm it's at least one
that exploits a lot of parallelism in
its underlying structure</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
