flaws with HTTP 1 and set that 80 to be
two would solve them but how does it do
it well take out your note-taking pencil
because I'm about to show you the
wonders of HD be to remember the human
readability of requests and responses
well that's gotta go it's the first step
to improve performance with HTTP two it
was nice while it lasted but nobody is
really benefiting from the plain text
approach that HTTP one took we are
wasting precious bites by spending
things out in text form when a single
bit is sufficient don't worry though
tools like Wireshark or devtools will
still let you see headers even with a
HTTP to the second big problem they
should be two salsas head of line
blocking it does this through a
technique called multiplexing
multiplexing is a fancy sounding term
that means combining multiple signals
into a new single signal with a db2 we
now have one connection instead of six
that seems like a terrible step
backwards at first but we are using the
single connection differently than
everyone would have what used to be a
dedicated connection in the HTTP one is
now called a stream and all streams
share that single connection these
streams are split up into frames and are
being multiplexed on to that single
connection when one stream is blocked
another stream can take over the
connection and make good use of what
would have been idle time head of line
blocking be gone lastly a gdp to takes
care of header data big uncompressed
with HTTP two headers are not just being
compressed with gzip the engineers came
up with an HTTP two compression that is
tailored towards the specific structure
of headers and the multiplexing feature
of HTTP to all streams not only share
the connection but also the compressor
this means a header never has to be sent
twice since the compressor recognize
that it's been sent before and sends a
reference instead for example cookies
are really long headers so it is an
enormous advantage to say insert the
same cookie header as three requests ago
here instead of the actual value I won't
go into the intricacies of this
compression algorithm but if you're
interested in how it works there is some
additional reading in the instructor
