normally characterized by several phases
what we call the software phases and
only one of these phases is mainly
focused on coding the other phases are
meant to support other parts of software
development so the first of these phases
is called requirements engineering and
that's the phase in which we talk to the
customer to the stakeholders whoever we
are building the software for and we try
to understand what kind of system we
need to build then we use this
information to define our design and the
design is the high-level structure that
then can become more and more details of
our software system once we have defined
our design we can actually move to the
next phase which is the implementation
in which we write code that implements
the design way which is defined after
implementing the code we need to verify
and validate the code we need to make
sure that the code behaves as intended
and finally we need to maintain the code
and maintenance involves several
activities like for example adding new
functionality or eliminating bugs from
the code or responding to problems that
were reported from the field after we
release the software we will look at all
of these activities and at the software
development process in detail in the
rest of the class and for each activity
we will look at its fundamental
principles and how it is done currently
and in some cases we will also look at
some advanced ways to do it for example
more research approaches for that
activity</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
