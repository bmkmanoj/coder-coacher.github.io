Jones dr.
Johnson uses the direct service provided
by his state hie this simplified and
somewhat futuristic diagram explains how
that could work here Marla's record has
a share button that's not quite
available yet but some EMR vendors are
working on integrating direct into their
workflow so it may appear in the future
dr. Johnson clicks it and selects dr.
Jones from a list of his usual referrals
if needed he could look up a new
physician in a directory provided by the
direct server called a health ISP or
hisp here for simplicity we're assuming
that dr. Johnson and dr. Jones are using
the same hisp before physicians are
listed their identities and
qualifications are verified and they're
assigned a special direct email address
this establishes trust so dr. Johnson
knows the email will only go to dr.
Jones the form of the record can be
whatever dr. Johnson chooses it could be
a scan of a paper record or it could be
a special XML formatted patient summary
specified under vdt in any case the
record is encrypted and attached to a
secure email this establishes security
so the information can't be viewed in
transit a key requirement for health
information exchange privacy was taken
care of when Marla consented to sharing
of a record with other physicians
involved in her care if you've ever
signed a HIPAA release in your doctor's
waiting room you agree to this dr. Jones
gets the email in her direct inbox and
can review the record if it's a PDF or
pay for scan if it is in a special XML
format called a continuity of care
document or CCD the record could be
parsed and put right in tomorrow's chart
in dr. Jones office as shown here
parsing at emerging it into an existing
record is yet another futuristic
component of this
diagram note that the encryption and
decryption of Marla's record is done
using public key encryption we'll look
at how that works in Lesson four</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
