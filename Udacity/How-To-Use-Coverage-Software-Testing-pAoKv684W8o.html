summary of how to use coverage to help
us build better software we have to
start off doing a good job testing and
there's no way around that the next step
is to measure the coverage of the tests
using some coverage metric that's
appropriate for the software that you're
testing if the coverage was pretty high
let's say eighty and ninety percent the
know we should do is use the feedback
from the coverage tool use feedback to
improve our test suite and measure
coverage again and if the coverage
results were poor that is a maybe we
only covered twenty percent of the
statements in our code base that's the
signal that we need to rethink our
testing strategy of course it could be
the case that we're perfectly happy with
poor coverage there plenty of scenarios
in for example web application
development we don't need good coverage
because our users are going to test the
code for us and for breaks will detect
it by looking at error logs and we'll be
able to fix it on the fly on the other
hand if we had poor coverage results for
some sort of avionics software or
automotive software it's going to be
deployed and it's extremely hard to
update we probably would need to rethink
our plan in a really serious way and try
to come up with a much better test suite
in order to get a higher level of
coverage if coverage is used in the
fashion live outlined here you can give
us a pretty significant amount of bang
for the buck regardless of the result
regardless of whether it's giving us a
little bit of feedback to get the last
five or ten percent of improvement in
coverage whether it's selling us at our
testing strategy really isn't very good
it's telling us useful information it's
telling us useful information we
probably need to know if we're going to
create a high-quality software and
finally I just want to finish up with a
reminder so we strongly believe that if
we have a good test suite and we measure
its coverage the coverage will be good
we do not believe on the other hand that
if we have a test suite that gets good
coverage it must be a good test suite
and the reason that that's not true is
that it's really easy to take a test
suite and tweak it until it gets really
good coverage without actually improving
the quality of it very much to finish up
used in the right way coverage can be a
relatively low-cost way to improve the
testing that we do for a piece of
software used incorrectly it can waste
our time and perhaps worse lead to a
false sense of security</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
