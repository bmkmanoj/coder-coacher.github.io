making me do I would say well for one
thing the number of parameters is
infinite right because if it's some
convex polygon and we're not putting any
bound on the number of sides on that
polygon then to specify it you have to
give what the points are for each of the
vertices and you know then as the number
of sides grows the number of parameters
grow so it's it's unbounded so it could
be that the VC dimensions can end up
being unbounded but they do seem you
know and in the limit they turn into
circles and circles ended up being a VC
dimension of three so maybe you know
maybe it's three maybe so
so actually you you you really sort of
stumbled on the right answer there or
maybe not so stumbled on to the answer
there so in the limit convex polygons
become circles right so draw a circle
for me okay now let's let's sort of try
to do this smartly so put a point on the
edge of the circle yeah I like how you
place that so pretty clearly you could
come up with a convex polygon that puts
that either in or outside of it right
because you know there's only one point
that's pretty easy yeah circle is kind
of irrelevant
yeah the sort was kind of irrelevant but
it's going to be a part of my little
trick so put another point on the circle
somewhere and in the same way that we've
been doing it before with lines you can
you know you can put both of them inside
a convex polygon on their outside you
know you can do all the labels I think
that's pretty easy to see now try three
so the first thing I want you to notice
Michael is that if I look at those three
points and I connected them together
what do I get
Oh a triangle I get a triangle which by
the way is a sorry to see a shape that
has the number of vertices equal to your
favorite number that's right but it's
also a kind of geometric shape it starts
with a starts with a starts with a see
apoplectic those starts with a say C
accentuated no it starts with a letter C
Oh convex yes it's actually a convex
polygon try putting a fourth point on
there and in fact put a fifth point and
a six point now here's my question we
put all of these points on this circle
right and let's just say it's the unit
circle because it's easy to think about
it so we put all these points on the
circle do you think we could shatter
this with a convex polygon to shatter it
right to give it all possible labelings
well let me draw the polygon
so each one being in or out well the
thing is the way you've drawn this
polygon all of them are in so if you use
this polygon what would you be labeling
those six points all positive all
positive what if I didn't want you to
label one of the points positive pick
one of the points any point will do so
if I don't want that to be in the
polygon what do I have to do just push
the corresponding vertex a little bit
inside right and the easiest way to do
that would be not to have a vertex there
at all but simply not to connect that
point um kind of like a rubber band art
or string art if we just kind of pop
that one out Zook right so any point you
of those six points you don't want to be
labeled positive just don't connect it
as a part of your polygon I see so for
any given pattern or subset which is
what we need to be able to show that you
know when we're shattering we need to
show that no matter what the subsidy is
there's going to be some hypothesis that
labels that appropriately you're saying
well just you know label the points as
plus and minus and connect up the pluses
it's going to leave the minuses outside
because they're going to be on the edge
of the circle and the pluses are all
going to be in the polygon because they
touch the edges of it yeah because they
are in fact the vertices and in this
case you just think of the fact that if
there's only two positive points a line
is a very very simple convex polygon and
if there's one point then a point is a
very simple convex polygon so the VC
dimension is six no so what happens if I
had seven points could I do it seven
what if I had eight points can I do it
it's the same trick we can make it eight
so can we make it nine no yes
so at what point can we stop when we ran
out of tape for the recording exactly so
that means that the number of points
that we can capture this way is in fact
unbounded which means the VC dimension
is infinite nice example now I do want
to point out that there's a teensy tiny
little point here that that we sort of
skipped over but I can explain in five
seconds which is we made polygons we
didn't actually argue that they were
convex but they are convex because
they're all inside the unit circle and
by construction every any polygon
whose vertices are on the unit circle
will be convex so it's just a that's why
we needed a circle that's why we were
being clever with it but there you go so
we have a polygon that we can always
draw that does the right thing and
because it's always subtended by a
circle it will be convex so we have
actually found a VC dimension that's
infinite hypothesis class that has a VC
dimension yeah that's what I said so
we've actually found the hypothesis
class whose VC dimension is infinite and
we came up with a proof for why it would
be that case and it nicely I think very
nicely connects with the observation you
made earlier that somehow it connects
with the number of parameters any it's
kind of cool I mean you end up with a
circle not having a very good VC
dimension a very high VC dimension but
convex polygons which somehow seem not
to be as cool as circles are in fact in
fact have infinite VC dimension okay so
there you go so we've done some practice
of VC dimension so you've given me all
this VC dimension stuff I agree that
it's cool Michel but what does that have
to do with what we started out this
conversation with how does that answer
my original question about you know the
natural log of an infinite hypothesis
