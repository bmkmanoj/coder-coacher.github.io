variables of interest in the data we
have looked at the allowed amount
charged amount and the payment amounts
now we will ask the question of
correlations in asking if the variables
are correlated we can ask if the
correlation is nonlinear or if the
correlation is linear we can inspect
this by looking at a scatter diagram of
the variables let us now inspect the
scatter diagram of the two variables f1
and f2 notice that we have plotted both
the variables after scaling them once
you are done you should have a graph
that looks very much like this the
scatterplot for these two variables are
very linear what we can conclude from
that is that the paid amounts are
directly proportional to the allowed
amounts similarly we can look at the
scatter plot of f0 and f1 in this case
although we have some correlation it is
not as linear as it is between f1 and f2
we want to have a quantitative
measurement of the correlation between
two variables we have already observed
from the scatter plot of f1 and f2 that
they are linearly correlated we can
calculate what is called the Pearson's
correlation coefficient let's first
define this quantity</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
