has drastically changed over the last 10
20 years and will continue to do so I
think the scariest phrase in the English
language is we've always done it that
way with advances in hardware and
software the pace of innovation has only
accelerated old methodologies simply
can't keep pace instead of shipping one
major version every couple of years
software companies are continuously
updating services that are offered
online when was the last time you got
software delivered by a CD people just
expect new features and fixes to happen
quickly without disruption to their
daily lives common roadblocks like
getting access to infrastructure have
pretty much been eliminated
virtualization has changed the game for
operational teams now you can create
servers in minutes and harness the full
power of those physical resources
development teams have more opportunity
to create templates clone snapshot
rollback and destroy whole environments
there's also online services like AWS or
digitalocean
where you can go and test your code
today people don't have a lot of
sympathy in our on-demand society if
your site doesn't work or your app is
buggy people have multiple ways to let
you know which leads to tarnishing your
brand's image this puts extreme pressure
on developers and operations but also
product managers and business people how
do you manage everything on this new
pace how do you change old habits and
organizational structures and processes
to adapt a development process with a
long detailed design phase and a
planning phase and then another long
implementation phase is slow inefficient
and err prone to top it off
organizational silos that prevent
communication leads to stale information
misconceptions and further slows down
the process water rose from the ashes of
past mistakes agile development was born
constant feedback with an iterative
approach allows to find problems quickly
for both developers and operations teams
but agile covers just the first part of
the application life cycle which is
development another part of the puzzle
comes from using agile and lean
approaches incorporating operations with
people still working in their silos
bottlenecks remain breaking down the
silos allow collaboration through all
stages of the development and this
brings us to the definition of DevOps</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
