to follow up with somebody you met in a
networking event that made an impression
is of course send them a thank-you email
but it's really about finding that one
thing you spoke about in your
conversation that you want to mention
again in that email that would make this
email specific and not a generic email
that the person thinks you sent out
everyone I think also having an action
item is a great thing perhaps following
up with a coffee chat or Skype call or
maybe you talked about an interesting
topic and if this follow-up email will
include an article about this or
something that you wrote or found
recently trying to make a connection
after the event is just as important if
not more important than the connection
in the event</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
