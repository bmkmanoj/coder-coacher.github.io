cognition let us consider three specific
ways first frames are a structured
knowledge representation we can think of
production systems as being atoms of
knowledge representation and frames has
been molecules of knowledge
representation a production rule
captures a very small amount of
information a frame can capture a large
amount of information in an organized
manner as a packet second frames enabled
me to construct a theory of cognitive
processing which is not entirely
bottom-up but it's partially top-down i
deceive a lot of data from the world but
not all of the cognitive processing is
bottom-up the data results in the
retrieval of information from my memory
that information that knowledge in the
form of frames then help to make sense
of the data it helps me generate
expectations in the world so then the
processing becomes not just bottom-up
but also crop top third frames capture
the notion of stereotype stereo types of
situations stereotypes of evens now
stereotypes can sometimes lead us to
incorrect inferences yet you and I have
stereotypes of various kind of events
and situations so why do we have
stereotypes because they are cognitively
efficient and why are you honorably
efficient because instead of reasoning
over the world n you each time they
already have default values associated
with them that's the property of frame
all the default values then enable me to
generate certain number of expectations
very rapidly that's cognitively
efficient here are three fundamental
connections between frames and human
cognition they are a lot more that will
get into slowly</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
