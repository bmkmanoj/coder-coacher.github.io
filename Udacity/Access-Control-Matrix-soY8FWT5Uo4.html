bit more this is a matrix the sides here
is M by n that's because we have M rows
from one two three all the way going up
to M and we have n columns so if you
look at one two all the way up to n so
this one the the first row we know
corresponds to user 1 that we have
similarly the second row is going to
correspond to user to user 3 and the
last one is going to be for user M
similarly if we look at the columns
remember these were four objects or
resources so this is for object one this
is for object two and all the way to
object n so we are talking about a CM u
comma au so that's going to be some
entry like this so if you take a look at
it this is our AC m3 because it's user 3
that we are talking about an object 2 so
this entry a 3 2 which is basically
going to describe how user 3 or u 3 is
allowed to access object o 2 if it
happens to a file it could be read
access or write access or execute access
things like that so this is what we just
discussed for the case where there M
users and objects so this is M by n
matrix Rho here corresponds to each user
a column here corresponds to its object
so again sort of if you focus on a
particular entry in this one remember
this is what access does user 3 have for
object 3 a 3 3 so this is going to be a
subset of the access rights how this
object can be accessed object o 3 for
example here user 3 we have here so
depending on what kind of object this is
so we've been talking about file objects
that contain data which can be read or
written so the access rights for a file
may be read write and execute this so
this could be some subset this could be
nothing
that means user 3 cannot access object o
3 in any way if it just has
read then we know reads aloud but it
user 3 cannot write or execute file that
is object 3 if it has read write execute
and of course use it 3 is allowed to
read or write or execute this file that
corresponds to object or 3</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
