q-learning rule and that is if we start
Q hat off pretty much anywhere and then
we update it according to the rule that
we talked about q4 when we see a
transition si RS prime then we update si
the Q value for si we move it alpha of
the way towards our plus gamma max a of
the well basically the q value of the
state s prime then as long as we do that
then this estimate this Q hat si goes to
Q si the actual solution to the bellman
equation and I write this with an
exclamation mark because it's like it's
one line of code it's one line of code
like how could you not just go out and
write this right now hmm but the the let
me just to finish is this is only true
if we actually visit si infinitely often
so you know that's an important caveat
that for this to actually hold true for
you to really converge to the solution
it has to run for a long time it has to
visit all state action pairs the
learning rates have to be updated the
way that we talked about before the next
states need to be drawn from the actual
transition probabilities but that's
that's cool if we actually are learning
in some actual environment and the
rewards needed to be drawn from the
reward function so this isn't so
problematic this is a little bit
problematic but it is still very
reassuring this idea that we have the
right form of an update rule so that the
thing that we converge to is the actual
optimal solution to the MDP cool and we
just have to wait till the heat death of
the universe or infinity and then we're
done yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
