demonstrate with operators and that's
how the increment and decrement
operators affect assignment we'll start
by creating a few variables and will
also create a variable that adds all of
these together so right now our total
pounds is equal to 4 now if i use the
increment or decrement operator in front
of a variable then it's applied before
any other operators in this expression
and that includes the assignment
operator so if we do plus plus pounds of
flour then our total pounds is now 5
because the increment is applied before
assignment and we can check to see the
new value of pounds of flour which is
two after being incremented now if
instead I move the increment or
decrement operator after the variable it
modifies then it's applied after the
other operators in this expression and
that again includes assignment so in
this case we've put the increment
operator after pounds of flour and our
total pounds is still the original four
pounds but we can see that pounds of
flour has been incremented to two it
just happened after the assignment of
total pounds so you'll want to be extra
careful when you use these incremented
decrement operators because of this
nuance so I'd encourage you to take some
time and play around with them in a
playground until you feel really
comfortable</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
