guaranteeing origin and path
authentication to guarantee these
properties there is a proposal to modify
the existing border gateway protocol to
add signatures to various parts of the
route advertisement this proposal is
sometimes called secure BGP or BGP SEC
the proposal has two different parts the
first part is an origin attestation
which is a certificate that binds the IP
prefix to the organization that owns
that prefix including the origin AS this
is sometimes also called an address
attestation
now this certificate must be signed by a
trusted party that trusted party might
be for example a routing registry or the
organization that allocated that prefix
to that organization in the first place
the second part of BGP SEC is what's
called a path attestation which are a
set of signatures that accompany the a s
path as it is advertised from one AAS to
the next let's have a closer look at BGP
sex path attestation and the types of
attacks that it can and cannot prevent</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
