helps to draw a class diagram so we have
class a whose base classes be and the
way this is typically drawn is to show
an arrow pointing up from the derived
class to the base class now we have
class c inheriting from A and Class D
also inheriting from a and then we have
class II inheriting from D so now it's
easy to answer our question so the
question what the subclasses of a is is
any class where you can follow these
errors up and reach a so the direct
subclasses RC&amp;amp;D he is also a subclass of
a the second question what are the super
classes of e and that will be the any
class we can reach starting from me
following the arrows up and there's one
more which you would get a bonus if
you've got this as well which is the
object class that's built in we don't
know anything else about B and may have
other super classes but we know it must
have object as one of its superclasses
because all classes we define in Python
eventually reach the built-in object
class finally which classes inherit from
D there it's only one class which is
classy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
