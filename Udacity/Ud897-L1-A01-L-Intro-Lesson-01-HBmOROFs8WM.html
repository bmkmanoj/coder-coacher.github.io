the script welcome to client-server
communications of course about the web
technically the web is only a small part
of the internet however it is the only
part of the internet that people use
without even realizing that what they're
using is the web the web is the platform
that you the web developer can use to
publish your ideas to the world it is
the common language between your servers
and your clients every time you open a
browser
every time you download an app every
time you receive a message on whatsapp
for Facebook you're using the web or
more generically in that very moment a
client is communicating with the server
and vice versa but what does that
actually mean what's happening when you
navigate to a website how did the phone
know that somebody sent me a message
what capabilities takes the web path and
more importantly what are its
limitations
hi I'm Surma I'm an engineer at Google
in London and I work with a chrome team
in this course we are going to
understand what the web actually is how
we can use it to your advantage and how
you can avoid mistakes it will make both
your user experience and security suffer
some of this may seem like a RIBA to you
and it is but we will also go into the
lesser-known parts of HTTP to think like
an engineer you need to understand both
the semantics at h-2b uses as well as
the implementation inside the browser
we'll use that knowledge to use browser
api's to the fullest potential security
against eavesdroppers and deploy the
web's newest protocol HTTP to all this
knowledge will help you make informed
decisions for your app and persuade
others when optimizing and securing
their apps hi i'm richard a course
developer at Udacity and an experienced
web developer while Surma teaches you
about HTTP requests in response cycle
security and the best practices of HTTP
2 I'll be here to reinforce this
knowledge with examples and quizzes
understanding both the capabilities and
limit
patience of the medium we work in on a
day-to-day basis will help you take the
next important step towards mastery by
the end of this course you will
understand literally every bite that is
being sent from your browser to the
server and back</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
