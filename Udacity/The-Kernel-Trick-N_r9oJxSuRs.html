cool we call it a trick I mean not too
many things in science are called a
trick and this is called the kernel
trick all right we saw that a linear
classifier only depends on dot products
remember that I circled it I jumped up
and down a minute so let's define some
function K of 2 points X I and X J as
just being the dot product ok between
them all right if I map a data point to
some high dimensional space so my
function fee here mats X - fee of X all
right then the dot product whoops I
actually should write it this way all
right the dot product K of X I XJ would
become fee of X transpose fee of XJ
that's what's written right there ok and
in fact what I'm actually gonna do is
I'm just gonna redefine K instead of
just being the dot product of X I and XJ
I'm gonna have a new K right which is
just this dot product of the the
higher-dimensional space K stands for
kernel ok and it's a it's it's a kernel
function and it can be thought of as a
similarity function similarity functions
the idea is that they get bigger more
similar things are and you know dot
products can go from you can either
think of it as minus 1 to 1 it's true so
the idea is being the most similar is
one least similar it's minus 1 ok and a
kernel function is a similarity function
that is the dot product sometimes called
the inner product of the higher
dimensional space ok so I'm going to
show you an example in a minute but
basically the idea is if I give you a
function of X 1 of X I and XJ some
function K as long as there's some
higher dimensional space in which that
function is just the dot product of that
higher dimensional space that kernel is
a dot product and therefore it can be
you
used in our linear classifier there's a
whole bunch of theory there about what
are called Mercer kernels which have to
do with water what types of kernels are
acceptable
you basically have to end up with these
positive definite matrices between your
points a couple of other constraints
what most of that doesn't matter what
matters is that you have to is you
is that you can show that essentially
it's a dot product and it turns out a
lot of functions are</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
