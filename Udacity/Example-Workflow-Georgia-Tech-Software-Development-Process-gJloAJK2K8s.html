though I would like to see what is the
basic workflow in a version control
system using the three actions that we
just saw and to do that I'm gonna use
two of our friends Brad and Janet so we
have Janet here bread and a VCS that
they're using now imagine that Janet
creates a file called foo dot txt and
put some information in the file at that
point she might want to add the file to
the repository and to commit it so that
her changes and the file get to the
central repository and when she adds an
commit that's exactly what will happen
and Fool will become available here and
will be accessible to the other users in
this case it will be accessible to bread
so if bread were to run an update
command what will happen is that the
file photo txt will be copied on the
local workspace of bread and bread we'll
be able to access the file at this point
bread might want to modify the file and
for example add something to this
existing file after doing that he also
might want to share the updated file
with Janet to do that he will commit the
file and the result will be exactly the
same of when Janet committed her file
that the updated file will be sent to
the repository and the repository will
store that information and make it
available for other users so now if
Janet performs an update she will get
the new version of food txt with the
additional information that was added by
bread and we will see all of this in
action in our next demo in a few minutes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
