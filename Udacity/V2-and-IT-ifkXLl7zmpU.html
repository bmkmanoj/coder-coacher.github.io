we can go upstairs a little bit to v2
and people do all sorts of work of
looking at different types of patterns
that cause different effects and so some
of them patterns were based upon like
little gratings and shapes and swirls
and things like that and sometimes they
were just on these types of edges and
things and in n despite and david von
essen's lab and they very well-known
neurophysiologist but when you look at
things like this it's a little difficult
to understand you know exactly how this
is moving upstream in the computational
world we understand the need for edges
and then you maybe make some argument
about circles and or curved parts one
might say that oh you know what I'm
seeing is stuff that may be dealing with
some types of intersections those kinds
of things but the neurophysiologist they
keep looking to understand what sorts of
images or low-level features will cause
cells to respond going upstairs even a
little bit further there's an area
called the info temporal cortex and
tanaka did a lot of work on looking at
different kinds of features that seem to
have cells that have a strong response
to these and not other kinds of things
and the idea was that maybe these are
where cells are starting to put things
together okay and I guess one of the
most well-known examples actually came
it was earlier and you know the dates go
different there was this so-called hand
neuron okay and what this was is this is
a neuron that when you showed it a
picture of a hand it would fire a lot in
the front of a hand the back of a hand a
remember these are kind of like line
drawings of hands and even this one and
and that once a different size scale but
what was interesting is if you had an
image that just had these little spokes
there it doesn't look like a hand to me
doesn't look like a hand to you well
obviously it didn't look like a hand to
this cell either and the idea that this
was a cell now you might wonder what
this picture of this person looking like
is well there was this whole
conversation of what was called did we
find the grandmother cell that is can
you find a cell it just fires when it
sees my grandmother and I think this was
just a play on that but on the one hand
it was kind of cool
that you would find a single cell that
was responding to say just hands on the
other hand we know for a lot of reasons
that it can't be as simple as you know
there's a one for one mapping between
concepts and cells because all sorts of
reasons why that would be a bad design
but we're getting at this idea that
what's being processed is no longer just
very simple features but something like
you know this which is obviously a
collection of features in a useful way
to further point that out here's two
pictures of what you and I would say are
approximately same size silhouette of a
rhinoceros and a lion and these look
sort of similar in terms of where the
stuff is okay but of course they're
different animals and what's nice is
that in v1 these triggers similar cells
so it's like cells that are responsible
to the edges in this location because
the edges are sort of in the same spot
but of course they respond differently
in i.t i.t is infratemporal cortex you
know the idea is that maybe in the
cortex is a cell that understands
something about rhinoceros so it won't
respond when it sees a lion and in fact
you can further confirm that by showing
it if you find cell that sees lions but
not rhinoceros now you show it to
different pictures one that's a line
drawing of a lion and the other one a
much smaller filled in silhouette of a
lion these objects substance look
different at the picture level but they
are the same thing and unlike the
previous pictures where there are
different things but similar at the
picture level these respond very
differently in v1 the early processing
and then there are the same in the info
temporal cortex so the idea being that
higher up our cells in the vision system
that understand something about the
appearance of object types at least
that's the that's sort of the story</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
