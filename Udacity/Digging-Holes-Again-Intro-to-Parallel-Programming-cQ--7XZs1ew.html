example if we're going to dig a hole
really interested in two things one is
how long it's going to take to dig that
hole and two how much work how many
total hours it will take to dig now if
you're the only one digging this hole
these two things are the same so we have
one worker and perhaps it's going to
take you eight hours to finish and so
that means overall you're going to do
eight hours of work but if you bring all
your friends over to dig the hole with
you the amount of time to finish and the
total amount of work might be different
so now we're going to have four workers
and perhaps they'll work together for
eight hours total and must be able to
finish in two hours
thus they've finished digging this hole
four times as fast we'd actually call
this ideal scaling since adding four
times as many workers allowed us to
finish four times as fast alternatively
we might have four diggers each of which
gets in each other's way so we're not
going to be quite as efficient so for
instance we might have four workers
and together it's going to take them
four hours to finish thus meaning that
together they've done sixteen hours of
work
now you might reasonably ask yourself
why your instructor spends so much time
talking about digging holes and that's a
fair point but there's a couple of
important points of terminology that I
want to make here the first is the
concept of a step it's how long it takes
it's a complete a particular computation
operation hole digging second is the
total amount of work that it took to
perform that computation over all the
active workers and so we're going to go
into a little more depth in terms of the
way that we define these</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
