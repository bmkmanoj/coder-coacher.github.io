the framework of a basic application and
this is actually the framework I've been
using for the homeworks and stuff that
I've been doing I've been using this
notion of templates which is not
something I'm going to explain
thoroughly in this class but instead of
doing string substitutions for big wads
of HTML we can keep our HTML in separate
files that look like HTML and that have
just little escapes for variables I'll
be using that in this example and you
can you know you're free to use them on
the homeworks yourself if you're tired
of doing string substitutions for
generating large chunks of text and I
also that this kind of little framework
we can we can provide if you'd like to
use that so all I've done is this is you
know you may recognize this as a
standard you know Google App Engine app
I added a class called handler which is
inherits from the the web app - handler
which is what you normally use and I
just added a couple of convenience
functions I made a function called write
which you know just calls response dot
out dot right so I don't have typed that
all the time and made a function called
render stir which takes a template name
and it returns a string of that rendered
template and and then I made another
function called render which instead of
returning just a string it calls right
on it and I've got a main handler down
here main page which is mapped to from
slash and all this does is it writes the
string ASCII Chan to the browser so
let's go ahead and switch the browser a
quick and make sure this is working here
we are in our browser we're printing
ASCII Chan okay all as well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
