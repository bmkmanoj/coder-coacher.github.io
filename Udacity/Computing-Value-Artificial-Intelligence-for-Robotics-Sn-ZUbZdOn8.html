code that implements this planning
algorithm you have a good years before
with zeros and ones you're familiar with
it
a starting location on the top left and
colocation on the bottom right because
in said in arbitrary obstacles like a
wall over here and a wall over here that
forces the Verdon tool and I could have
an s-curve or on the corner and if I run
this code with this table what I get is
a table that looks like this
this for each of the states that is an
on wall state tells me what's the
optimal thing to do
so over here it says go south here it
says go right here it says go up here
says go right again and go south realize
even states and I'm not likely to ever
reach like the one over here and the one
over here have an optimal policy and
action associated because there's really
no a start state there's just the goal
state over here so the specification of
the initial state has no bearing on this
result how can we compute this
efficiently so let me make a simple
example of a world like this with an
obstacle over here and say our goal
state is the one in the corner over here
rather than telling you how to compute
the optimal policy which assigns an
action to each of these cells
let me instead teach you about value a
value function associates to each grid
cell the length of the shortest path to
the goal for the goal of visit zero for
each adjacent cell to the goal it's out
to be one for the guys over here two
three four five six and seven
this is recursively calculated by taking
the optimal neighbor x-prime y-prime
considering its value and by adding the
cost it takes to get there which in our
example they'll be plus one by applying
this update equation recursively we can
attain this value function over here and
once we have this value function we find
that the optimal control action is
obtained by minimizing the value which
is a hill climbing type of
action let me give you a quiz in this
world here with the goal location over
here I'd like to understand what is the
value of the cell in the bottom right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
