still carrying some Squared's you want
to talk it through
okay sure so X is really x1 x2 and riot
y is really y1 y2 and Phi X is now this
crazy triple x so I so I wrote down x1
squared x2 squared square root of 2 X 1
X 2 if that's the vector that we get for
Phi X and then for Phi Y I get y1 it
seems like it would be helpful to see
this know you want to write it down sure
okay so that turns out to be the same as
what you say x1 squared x2 squared x2
squared root 2 x1 is you root 2 x1 x2
okay and then the Y vector gets
transformed to the same thing except for
with Y's y1 squared comma y2 squared
comma root 2 y1 y2 okay so then the dot
product is just the products of the
corresponding components summed up so x1
squared y1 squared plus x2 squared y2
squared
mm-hmm 2 x1 x2 y1 y2 that's right so
here's a question for you Michael does
that look familiar
based on your years of thinking about
algebra oh thanks for writing it that
way I see we can is this right so it's
it's like we can factor this
it's like x1 plus x2 times y1 plus y2
yeah that's right wait is that right now
it's not right
x1 y1 plus x2 y2 whole thing squared
right so let's write that down so if you
factor it out you're right this is
exactly equal to x1 y1 plus x2 y2
squared and what's an even simpler way
of writing that I see x1 y1 plus
- why - looks like a dot product itself
it looks like the dot product of x and y
oh it's X transpose Y on the inside and
then we square it on the outside it's
exactly right so now you see why there
was method to my madness when I created
the fie function not yet so you're
saying if we're just dealing with dot
products no I'm still a little confused
so so it is the case that you define
these in an interesting way so that the
dot product became the square of the old
dot product right so now let me make two
observations
okay here's observation one what's X
transpose Y I mean geometrically what
does that represent the length of the
projection of Y onto X no I mean
geometrically like go all the way back
to geometry third grade you didn't do
transpose okay I know he didn't do
transposes but you did equations like
this or at least later you learned there
were equations like this here pretend
you're in third grade and I said talk to
me about geometry what kind of words
would you use Oh what's in geometry
triangles circles yeah
circles did you say circles sure but
only because I thought you might wanted
me to did you say circles that's a
really ugly looking circle sure sure
this is basically a particular form of
the equation for a circle which means
that we've gone from thinking about the
linear relationship between X I and X J
or your data points and we've now turned
it into something that looks a lot more
like a circle interesting so if and this
is my second point Michael if you
believe me in the beginning where we
notice that X I transpose XJ is really
about similarity it's really about why
it is you would say two points are close
to one another or far apart from one
another by coming into this
transformation over here where we
basically represented the equation for a
circle we have now replaced our notion
of similarity from being this very
simple projection to being the notion of
similarity is whether you fall in or out
of a circle so more sort of about the
distance as
opposed to what direction you're
pointing right and both of them are fine
because both of them represent some
notion of similarity some notion of
distance in some space in the original
case we're talking about two points that
are lined up together and over here with
the server with this particular equation
we've represented whether they're inside
the radius of a circle or outside the
radius of a circle now this particular
example assumes that the circles
centered at the origin and so on and so
forth but the idea I want you to see is
that we could transform all of our data
so that we separated points from within
one circle two points that are outside
of the circle and then if we do that
projecting from two dimensions here into
three dimensions we basically take in
all of the pluses and move them up and
all of the minuses and move them back
and now we can separate them with a
hyperplane without knowing which ones
are the pluses and which ones are the
minuses of course of course because I
see because they are the ones that were
closer to the origin right they get
raised up less Wow okay so using that
third dimension right now this is a cute
trick right I can basically take my data
and I transform it into a higher
dimensional space where suddenly I'm now
able to separate it linearly that's very
cute but I chose this particular form
for a reason can you guess why because
it fits the circle pattern that you
wanted ah but there are lots of
different ways we could have fit the
circle pattern I chose this particular
form because not only does it fit the
circle pattern but it doesn't require
that I do this particular transformation
rather than taking all of my data points
and projecting them up into three
dimensions directly I can instead still
simply compute the dot product and now I
take that answer and I square it so
you're saying in this formulation of the
quadratic program that you have there in
terms of capital W if you write code to
do that each time in the code you want
to compute that x1 Trek's I transposed
times XJ if you just squared it right
before you actually use it it would be
as if you projected it into this third
dimension and found a plane yes that's
exactly right that's crazy
it's so crazy
as a name and that is the kernel trick
so again if we really push on this
notion of similarity what we're really
saying is we care about maximizing some
function that depends highly upon how
different data points are alike or how
they are different and simply by writing
it this particular way all we're saying
is you know what we think that the inner
product is how we should define
similarity but instead we could use a
different function altogether fee or
more nicely represented as X transpose Y
squared and say that's our notion of
similarity and we can substitute it
accordingly so we never really used fee
we never used fee we were able to avoid
all of that by coming up with a clever
representation of similarity that just
so happened to represent something or
could represent something in a higher
dimensional space but so is it important
that such a fee exists or is it just the
case that we can you know if we could we
could throw in a cubed we could throw in
a forth we could do a square root and a
log like can we do anything we want
there in that X X I transpose XJ or we
constrained to only use things that
somewhere out there there's a way of
representing it as a regular dot product
well that's an interesting question the
answer is you can't just use anything
but in practice it turns out you can use
almost anything and the other answer
your question is well it turns out for
any function that you use there is some
transformation into some dimensional
space higher dimensional space that is
equivalent well now it may turn out that
you need an infinite number of
dimensions to represent it but there is
some way of transforming transforming
your points into a higher dimensional
space that happens to represent its
kernel or whatever kernel you choose to
use so which part is the kernel so the
kernel is the function itself so in fact
let me let me let me clean up the screen
a little bit and and see if we can make
this a little bit more precise and
easier to understand</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
