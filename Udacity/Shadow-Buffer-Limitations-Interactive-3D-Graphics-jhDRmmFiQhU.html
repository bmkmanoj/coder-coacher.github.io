model I expect you'll see some odd
shading on them if you make the
headlight brighter the effect will
become more obvious moving the spotlight
is likely to shift these patterns around
the shadow mapping algorithm works by
seeing the world from the lights point
of view the depth image formed is then
checked during normal rendering the
depth of the surface visible at a point
is compared with the transform depth at
the shadow map buffer holds and that's
where all the trouble begins the pixels
and the lights image of the world don't
exactly match up with those in the
camera's view these caused some form of
what's called surface acne where little
dark dots or patches appear in areas
that should be fully lit take this
example the lights view of the surface
says that it's 3.8 au metres away from
the light the cameras view of the
surface says that the location is three
point eight one meters away from the
light since this value is slightly
higher than the lights view the surface
is considered in shadow the surface is
something that should be impossible it
shadows itself as the depths don't
compare as well as we would like here's
a demo showing the problem as well as a
partial solution on these surfaces you
can see patterns of acne where the
geometry is shadowing itself one obvious
solution is to add some tolerance value
called a shadow bias if the cameras
computed distance along the lights view
plus this bias is less than the lights
depth then consider the surface lit
unfortunately is simple bias leads to
another problem called Peter panning
just like Peter Pan the object starts to
look as if it's become detached from its
shadow and sometimes as if it's hovering
above its true location in the 35 or so
years this algorithm has been around
many different solutions have been
proposed to this problem there are other
problems with shadow mapping such as the
edges of the shadows looking pixelated
and solutions such as percentage closer
filtering and cascaded shadow maps I
won't explain these here except to say
that 3j s has both of these solutions
built in</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
