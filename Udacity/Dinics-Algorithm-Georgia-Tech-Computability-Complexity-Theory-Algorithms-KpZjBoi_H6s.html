algorithm that I can't resist and that's
to to Dennett he actually published his
algorithm in nineteen seventy two years
before edmonds-karp his key insight is
that the work of computing the shortest
path can be recycled so that a full
recomputation only needs to happen when
the shortest path distance changes not
for every augmenting path as with all
augmenting path strategies we start with
an initial flow of zero then we repeat
the following we build the level graph
from the residual flow Network and let K
be the shortest path length from s to T
then while there's a path from source to
sink in the level graph that has length
K will augment the flow along that path
and then update the residual capacities
and we repeat this until there are no
more s T paths in the residual network
and finally we just return the flow
turning to the analysis we'll call one
iteration of this outer loop of phase
and we'll be able to argue that each
phase increases the length of the
shortest st path in the residual network
by one the principle here is the same as
for edmonds-karp augmenting by a
shortest path flow doesn't create a
shorter augmenting flow hence once we've
exhausted all paths of a given length
the next shortest path must be one edge
longer within a phase the level graph is
built by breadth-first search so that
only costs order e time the hardest part
of the argument will be that this loop
altogether takes only e times V time
we'll see this argument in a second
altogether
we will show that dennis's algorithm
takes e times V squared time which is an
improvement over the e squared V time of
edmonds-karp</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
