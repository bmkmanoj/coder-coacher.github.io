the unnecessary predictor variables now
let's test how this model performs with
an independent sample this will be the
validation data set to do this ultrix
has a great tool found in the gallery
called a model comparison tool this
allows users to validate models and
compare models against each other check
out the instructor notes on how to add
this to your tool palette so what we're
going to start with is our full built
out stepwise model I'm now gonna bring
in that model comparison tool and show
you how to use it in the EM input side
we throw in the model object that we
want to validate so the model object
from the step wise tool goes into this M
model comparison input the other side is
the D side this is going to be our
validation data set so I'm going to grab
the V from the create samples tool and
plug that into the model comparison tool
now the only thing we need to configure
with this model comparison tool is what
is the positive target class meaning do
we want yeses or noes to be positive
Association our truths or falses are
ones and zeros and just know I'm going
to choose yeses for this result as you
can see we have three different outputs
but I'm only going to look at this our
output which is the report so there's
many different results that come outside
of this model comparison report the
first thing is the fit and error
measures this tells us the overall
accuracy as well as the accuracy of
predicting nose as compared to
predicting yeses and some other
different variables that we don't really
need to go into too much if their
definitions are found right below as we
can see the validation data set was
predicted quite well by this model
and overall accuracy was at 91% the noes
were predicted quite high at 92% yet the
yeses were a little bit tougher to to
predict it says add only eighty-three
percent accuracy this next result is the
confusion matrix which shows us of the
knows how many were actually predicted
correctly as compared to
yes as you can see we had 504 records
that were predicted note that were
actually no yet we had 45 records that
were a predicted note that were actually
yeses this result shows a pretty good
representation of where biases may occur
do we have way more knows that were
predicted yeses or way more yeses that
were predicted noes and lastly we have
some different diagnostic plots at the
bottom that we'll go more into later but
judging based off with just this
confusion matrix and the fit in error
measures I think this model is quite
strong but before we get ahead of
ourselves I'm going to test this model
out against our other models that we're
going to create next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
