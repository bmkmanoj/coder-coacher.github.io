that are involved in the PageRank
algorithm that you went over the mid-six
is how similar is as to what Google does
or other search engines when their
ranking pages so this is a good question
so the PageRank algorithm that we
described in unit 6 is exactly what
Google's started with and this was the
research paper that Larry Page and
colleagues wrote about how they would
improve search ranking and that's
exactly the algorithm that we
implemented in unit 6 and that was what
Google was doing in its early days
things are a lot more complicated today
and a lot of the reason for that is well
sites adapt and you remember Anna
Patterson was talking about how sites
adapted to the way ulta mr. was ranking
by putting lots of copies of the same
word on the page to try to show up top
in the rankings and started to make the
results less useful sites have also
adapted a page rank by trying to find
ways to get links to the page have their
own pages linked to their own other
pages that look different to Google
making it so there's lots of in links
and trying to make it so you get a high
rank in the page and there's entire
consultants whose businesses try to find
ways to get your page higher ranked in
Google so that means that for PageRank
to continue to work well they have to
take into account more things so they
look at things like how things appear in
the page they look at other contexts
they look at other information not just
the link structure but that's still the
basis for a lot of the ranking of pages
is the link structure and you can see
evidence of page rank on kind of what
the search results you get when you're
using google it's very very common that
wikipedia is one of the top three
results on almost anything you search
for and that's because a lot of people
link to Wikipedia because it has a good
authority but also that Wikipedia links
to itself a lot right that kind of
structure hundreds of pages linked to
other higher up pages and it's also the
content of the pages is also high
quality and there's things that Google
is trying to do to measure the quality
of pages as well yes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
