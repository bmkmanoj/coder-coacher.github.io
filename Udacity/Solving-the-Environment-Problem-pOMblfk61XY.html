production and development environments
is called a golden image the idea is to
take the operating system libraries and
our application itself and wrap them up
in a standard or golden master image of
a virtual machine that can be used and
reused without the need to configure
each new machine individually these
golden images can be used both on
desktop workstations as a virtual
machine and on servers you can also
create golden images of containers
another approach is to just install a
base operating system and then use a
configuration management system that
performs automatic installation and
configuration of software on every
machine under its control thus making
sure that all the machines have the same
configuration to be sure of that the
installation should start from the same
base OS image otherwise there could be
OS level differences the difference is
that a golden image system requires more
work upfront and has to be regenerated
never there any changes but once it's
done it's very fast to boot up a new
server or VM with it with a
configuration management system on the
other hand booting up will be slower
because every machine needs to install
the same software on the first boot
however if there is a configuration
change it's easy and fast to get these
changes out to the machines without the
need to regenerate the image and of
course you can have something in between
for instance install the base software
and libraries perform the main
configuration create a golden image and
then use it to bring up the machines
then once they're up use a configuration
management system to perform smaller
rolling updates if both the image
creation and configuration management
processes are automated and in a version
control system it's easy to reproduce
these steps and that's what you'll do is
the first step in this project build a
golden image that has all the software
necessary for dev and also works in the
cloud for a production server you won't
work with a configuration management
system in this project because that
topic would require a whole course of
its own
maybe later for now you will have to
download and install a couple of
programs press next to see the
instructions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
