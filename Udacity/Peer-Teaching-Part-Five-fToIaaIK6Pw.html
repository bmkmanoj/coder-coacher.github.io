will appear I'm going to learn no longer
needs a teacher the the teacher will be
killed by somebody and then you have to
go off and learn kung foo first I think
you're actually taking the plot of
kungfu I am okay well anyway I'd like to
thank Jordan Jordan Pollock for this I
really love this example I was really
the first example of kind of mechanism
design that really sort of hit home for
me nice and it seems relevant to this
kind of online teaching scenario that
we're in right now yeah I mean it's not
enough for I mean I know I'm sure some
people taking this class have actually
done peer grading and there is always
this question of why I want everyone
just give everybody good great you have
to construct something so that doesn't
happen can okay so I'm gonna give you
one more example I think and then I'll
be pretty I think how many people sort
of cover the space enough what do you
think of that that would be great okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
