three-dimensional space and let's start
out by thinking about planes we're going
to start by studying planes in
three-dimensional space because they are
highly analogous to lines in
two-dimensional space just like a single
linear equation ax plus B y equals K
encodes a line in two-dimensional space
a single linear equation ax plus B y
plus cz equals K encodes a plane in
three-dimensional space another way to
view the equation ax plus B y plus cz
equals K is like before a dot product of
two vectors a B C dot XY Z equals K and
like before with lines if we take a b c
XY z equals zero that means that vectors
from the origin to points X Y Z in the
plane are orthogonal to the vector a B C
thus ABC is a normal vector to the plane
and also like with lines changing the
value of the constant term K shifts the
plane but it doesn't change the
direction of the plane at all so
regardless of the constant term the
plane defined by ax plus B Y plus cz
equals K has ABC as a normal vector
let's call two planes with parallel
normal vectors parallel since their
faces are in the same direction if we
have two parallel planes ax plus B Y
plus cz equals k1 and ax plus B y plus
cz equals k2 the same coefficients in
front of each variable but different
constant terms then that means any point
XYZ satisfying the first equation can't
satisfy the second and vice versa so two
different parallel planes do not
intersect this is just like the case
with lines in two dimensions two
different lines with the same normal
vector don't intersect we also have
another analogy to our treatment of
lines in two dimensions remember that if
we knew two lines were parallel then we
could check to see if they were the same
line by finding the vector between a
point on one line and a point on the
other if that vector was orthogonal to
- the lines normal vectors then the
lines are the same similarly if two
planes are parallel that is they have
parallel normal vectors then we can pick
a point on one plane and another point
on the other if the vector connecting
them is orthogonal to the planes normal
vectors then the two planes must be the
same</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
