applications tend to be sensor-based and
these sensors can be simple sensors like
temperature sensors and humidity sensors
are more interesting and complex sensors
like cameras and microphones and radars
and so on and these sensors are
distributed which means that you have to
access them via the Internet and what we
want to do with these sensor streams is
live stream analysis and often see often
such applications are also called
situation awareness applications where
what we are doing is we are gathering
sensor data in order to analyze in real
time what is happening in the
environment and take appropriate
decisions so such situation awareness
applications exhibit a control loop
going from sensing prioritizing the
sense data to figure out what are
important for instance if there are lots
of cameras and there is no action in
front of some cameras some cameras are
more interesting than others that is the
prioritization step of figuring out what
sensors are interesting and then
devoting more computational resources to
analyze the camera streams or other
sensor streams and as a result of that
taking some actions and this might
involve actuated other sensors actuated
triggers activating other software
entities or even humans to intervene in
terms of what actions may need it to be
taken and part of this control loop may
also be feedback to the sensors
themselves to retarget them for example
there may be a camera that you may want
to point in a different direction and
there are cameras like pan tilt zoom
cameras which you may want to control
depending on what you are observing in
the environment and such a control loop
characterization of situational
awareness applications can be applied to
a lot of emerging distributed multimedia
sensor
based applications such as traffic
analysis emergency response disaster
recovery robotics asset tracking and so
on and all such applications are
computationally intensive and because
they are dealing with real live streams
coming from the sensors they have
real-time properties which means that
there is a need to shrink the latency
from sensing to actuation so that we can
take timely actions based on the sensed
data since they are computationally
intensive we need horsepower to run
these large-scale normal multimedia
distributed sensor based applications
and so computational engines such as the
clusters and the clouds may be deployed
in order to cater to the needs of these
large-scale sensor-based distributed
applications</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
