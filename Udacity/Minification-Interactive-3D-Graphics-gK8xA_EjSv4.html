texels and pixels to be around 1 to 1 if
the texels cover too many pixels will
get blurring as we saw in the previous
lesson this isn't so bad for real
textures so airing a bit on the side of
smaller textures is not the worst crime
you can commit if a pixel covers too
many texels we get minification which
leads to different problems for a high
resolution checker texture it simply
causes the edges to become sharp however
the problem is much worse than this
under normal viewing conditions changing
the texture resolution does not help
when a pixel covers more than one texel
minification occurs this is what's
happening in the distance there's a
separate filter on the texture for this
situation
the reason it's separate is that this
problem has a different solution
currently this minification filter is
set to be nearest neighbor as we saw for
magnification this is usually a bad
choice let's turn on bilinear
interpolation for the minification
filter - this helps a little bit towards
the middle of the image but not much the
problem is that each pixel in the
distance covers a few texels as we get
closer and closer to the horizon the
number of texels per pixel increases
when the fragment shader looks up what's
in the texture it gets whatever Texel
happens to be at the center of the pixel
at the horizon this selection is almost
random so we get noise as we vary
between white and black texels even with
bilinear interpolation on it's still
just noise with magnification we found
that too many pixels covering one texel
caused blurring getting this ratio
closer to 1 to 1 made things just right
here we have too many texels in one
pixel one solution is to go in the
opposite direction then we went for
magnification instead of making our
checkerboard have a larger and larger
resolution we'd like it if the distant
pixels used a lower resolution texture
this would bring the ratio of texels 2
pixels about back to 1 to 1 I can show
this by lowering the resolution of the
texture I'll say it again the video may
not show much difference as these videos
are heavily compressed so that they're
quicker to download your best bet is to
try this demo out for yourself it
follows this lesson
anyway changing the resolution helps a
bit towards the middle of the image
since these pixels have more and more
texels as we move to the horizon
blurriness is much better than noisiness
especially on moving the view around
things still look terrible on the
horizon because every pixel in that area
ever so many texels that even our
two-by-two Texel image fails if we go to
a 1x1 checkerboard pattern that might
help a bit what in the world is a 1x1
checkerboard well it's just a single
checker square a single Texel since I
can't put both black and white in this
Texel I make this Texel gray choosing
this texture is like the nuclear option
the horizon looks better than noise but
now everything is gray to sum up at some
point near the horizon there are just
too many texels to pixels so to avoid
noise we go too gray try the demo
yourself at this point and see how
changing the Texel the pixel ratio
affects the image</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
