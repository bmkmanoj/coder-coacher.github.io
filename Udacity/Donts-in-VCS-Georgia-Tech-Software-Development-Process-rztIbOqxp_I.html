a few more things in particular I want
to discuss the main dance in VCS so what
are some things that you don't want to
do and you should not do when you're
using a version control system and I'm
gonna mention two in particular because
these are two that I witness several
times when I was teaching this class and
also when collaborating with other
people so there are two kinds of
resources that you don't want to add to
a VCS normally one is the write files
for example an executable that is
derived by compiling a set of source
files where the source files are already
in the repository at that point there is
no reason to also add the executable
file in the repository so in general any
executable file should not be added to
repository the second class of files
that I want to mention is this bulky
binary files if you have one such file
it is normally not a good idea to store
them under a version control system to
store them in the repository there might
be exceptions to these rules but in
general these are the kind of files that
you want to keep lock up and you don't
want to put in the VCS repository
another typical mistake and that happens
all the time
especially to novice users of VCS is
that you get your file from VCS and so
you get your local copy of the file that
was in the VCS and you want to make some
changes and before making the changes
you decided let me actually save a local
copy of the file and I'm gonna work on
that one or let me save it before I
modify it or let me take a snapshot of a
whole tree of files just because I don't
really trust the fact that VCS is gonna
be able to help me is gonna be able to
recover from possible mistakes never
ever do that I saw it done many times
and it always leads to disasters first
of all it is useless and second is risky
because then what happens is that at the
time in which you have to turn in your
assignment in the case you're doing an
assignment but in even more serious
situation when you have to turn in your
code for example to your colleagues you
always end up being confused about which
is the version that you're really using
so absolutely no local copies no local
redundance when you're using a version
control system trusts the version
control system and trusts the version
control system to be able to manage your
versions you can always save it commit
it retrieve previous versions and you
be able to do everything that you can do
by copying the file yourself and even
more so again trust the VCS</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
