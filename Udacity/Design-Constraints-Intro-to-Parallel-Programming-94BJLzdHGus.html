and you talk about let's design the next
generation processor what are really the
design constraints that you think are at
the top of the list so certainly power
is going to be you know number one for
sure yeah so energy efficiency is is
always the number one design constraint
I think very closely behind it though is
program ability and range of
applications and again sports for
divergence is a good example of that we
want to have you know both the control
structure in a memory system that will
run diverged codes well to give us a
broader range of applications and then
we'll look at a program ability and it's
not just being able to write the program
and get it to function but to get a
large fraction of the absolute
performance you can get out of the
machine without undue effort and a lot
of this is removing performance
surprises from the architecture so that
if you write the code in a very
straightforward way you'll actually get
pretty good performance and it won't be
awful and then you'll have to sit there
trying to deeply understand some obscure
fact of the memory system to figure out
why you've fallen off a performance
cliff and that's something that's
changed really an enormous amount in the
last five years the the cliffs for GPUs
have historically been steeper than for
CPUs but they're getting much flatter as
a result of the work you guys are doing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
