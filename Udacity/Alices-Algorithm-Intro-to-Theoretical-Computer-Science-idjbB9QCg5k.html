understanding about the algorithm that
Alice is using I'm going to write it
down in a sort of pseudocode that means
I'm not going to write real Python code
or any other programming language that
you used to but basically do a more
formal description of this trying all
possibilities algorithm so the solution
that we're looking for is going to be
written into a variable called minimum
devices and initially to start off the
algorithm we're going to set that
variable to the number of communication
centers because that is the maximum
number of monitoring devices that you're
going to need in any case the algorithm
then goes through each assignment of the
values 0 and 1 to the communication
centers and what I mean by that is a
value of 0 means that communication
Center does not get a monitoring device
and a 1 means that we are going to
install a monitoring device at that
communication center the algorithm then
checks if the assignment is valid and
what I mean by valid is that the
communication centers that have a 1 in
the assignment are monitoring all the
cables in the network if we have a valid
assignment the algorithm then computes
how many devices we used in that
assignment which is simply summing all
the ones that are in the current
assignment that we're working on the
algorithm then checks if the current
assignment is a better solution than the
best one we have found so far and it
does that by taking the minimum of the
currently known best solution which is
minimum devices here and the number of
devices in the current assignment if
you're familiar with algorithms you
might already see a few issues even in
this pseudocode with this algorithm but
we're going to go into that more deeply
in unit 3 actually right now we're just
going to work with this very simple
version here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
