eavesdropping where an attacker Eve
might gain unauthorized access to
information being sent between Alice and
Bob so for example if Alice and Bob were
chatting on instant message or if Alice
sent an email to Bob the potential
exists in other words there is a threat
that Eve might be able to hear that
communication there are various packet
sniffing tools such as Wireshark and TCP
dump that set a machines network
interface card into what's called
promiscuous mode if Alice Bob and Eve
are on the same local area network where
packets are being flooded for example if
they were being connected by a hub that
flooded all packets everywhere or if the
learning switch did not have an entry
for Alice or Bob then Eve might be able
to hear some of those packets if the
network interface card is in promiscuous
mode then Eve's machine will be able to
capture some of the packets that are
being exchanged between Alice and Bob
it's worth thinking about how different
types of traffic might reveal important
information about communication so for
example the ability to see DNS lookups
would provide the attacker information
about say what websites you're visiting
the ability to capture packet headers
might give the attacker information not
only about where you're exchanging
traffic but what types of applications
you're using and the ability to see a
full packet payload would allow an
attacker to effectively see every single
thing that you are sending on the
network including content you're
exchanging with other people such as
private messages email communication and
so forth given the ability to see a
packet Eve might not only listen to that
packet but might also modify it and
re-inject it into the network
potentially after altering the state of
the packet if additionally Eve could
suppress the original message let's
consider an attack on authenticity if in
addition to being able to observe
get to roast in the network Eve could
reject packets after having modified
them and suppress Alice's original
message then Eve could effectively
impersonate Alice this is sometimes
called a man-in-the-middle attack Alice
could also make it appear as though this
message came from Alice in which case
the attack would be an attack on message
integrity</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
