webcast on HTML and CSS I'm dimka and
this is drawn um and we're course
managers here at Udacity um ended it
with any we talking about um some CSS
things the way CSS works is you have a
selector of example darkest classes and
then a styling and then you have styling
that goes into the curly brackets right
so for example um I have this really
simple HTML and as you can see it's just
a bunch of boxes right and then I've
linked into I've linked here to my style
sheet which is called style dot CSS and
then for example if I wanted to target
it um all done all the class all the
class box ones I can do this via this
notation so dot box select all the class
box and then inside I have property
Colin Valley and so background color
gray and then 10 pixels margin to the
bottle and mean height of 50 pixels and
then as you can see all of my gifts i
define it as as having class box and
then each one also has an additional
clerics class box one box to box 3 right
and so over here when you go like into
the separate box one box toy box 3 I
actually overwrite the background color
property so I gave each one a different
background color and then if we open
this in the browser all right so this is
how it looks like right um they all have
different colors they all have like the
salmon height of 50 pixels and then 10
pixels in between them the box model is
something that you have probably seen
but just a quick recap so all elements
are boxes if we go into the developer
tools can select for example this and
you can see where did oh there we go and
you can see that this is really um how
it looks like alright so there's um it's
this box it can change the padding here
too I don't know 40 pixel
so um see how weird this actually moved
moved to the text 40 pixels to the right
yeah I'm the padding is inside right yes
so usually um this is the content
whatever you have inside the box get the
text images another box whatever and
then the padding is comes right after
that and the border is actually after
the padding right so the border
encompasses that content and the padding
and then after the birth are there is
the margin so if we for example so this
is set to 10 why not set ago 40 is when
you see good everybody else just like
down to accommodate this like 40 pixels
padding so yes so the box model pretty
cool box elements versus black lemons
versus inline elements and so divs H
ones most of what you can think of those
are all block elements there are a
couple of inline elements I think mostly
tags such as bold like making your text
bold and things like that um yeah but
their block elements right are they're
stacked vertically and inline elements
are kind of in the same line yeah right
yeah so like block elements are sort of
like they take all the spaces they can
take um in-line and horizontally but as
the little spaces they can take
vertically so for example in the CSS
code that I show you all the boxes had a
min height of 50 pixels and if we take
that min hideaway so you seek in here
mean height 50 pixels right say for this
box and I take that away whoops on the
boxes all the boxes disappeared the only
one that remained is this one because it
has content in it when we give them in
height back they go back but because
because these are block elements there
you know default properties is as be as
wide as you can but as short as you can
right so they're going to either
accommodate content if they have content
or if you
specified mean height for them they're
going to accommodate that if they're if
they don't have content and don't have
been high they're just not going to show
let's change that to Yemm mm-hmm so it's
big huge that's pretty massive so maybe
one with something with smaller like I'm
a 3m or something let's do that so yeah
so yeah so yeah so you can you can play
with emm it means if you change the font
than the default pop and this size will
change accordingly mmhmm yeah you can
put all the percentages all the others
that we talked about the age etc or
there's two kinds of centering right you
either want to Center your div or you
want to Center the things in the div
right right so to send our YouTube um
you can use the margin left right and
margin right properties in then so so if
you set them to auto that's going to set
that's gonna send her the feve so oh and
then you can see what happened we set
left the auto and it's like it had its
arm and it pushed it all the way over to
the left I was Ben Jackie's visual for
that then when you said right it's like
take the right arm and you push your
sleep wish that they've pushed itself
all the way across from the right side
right so you're telling it be as much as
you can to the left but also be as much
as you can to the right that's sort of
like two conflicting instructions so
what does it do stands right there in
the middle um so that's that's a way to
Center your element to Center the text
or whatever um if you have text inside
the element and you can just use the
text align property and then you can use
different things but you can use center
if you want it the text to be centered
right now so now this is separating we
can also use do other things such as I'm
say nice and just justified yeah another
thing that you can use instead of using
margin left and white so let's get rid
of these is um you can use a margin
ohana so this is actually margin zero
and auto so this looks like it does the
same thing because what this does is it
sets the top and bottom margins 20 and
then the left and right margins tube
auto
and the top and bottom margins are very
different this is our very different
from the left and right just because
those elements because Fox elements
behave differently when it when it comes
they behave differently for Dickie Lee
versus horizontally so you can actually
center in the middle of the screen using
something like margin-top auto or margin
bottom oh no that just won't work yeah
so it's fine to do something like this
you say top and bottom or zero and left
and right or auto it's the shorthand
sure okay yeah if you float an element
they they take your element and sort of
cause it to make it look like as if it's
liking it on a layer of its own it's
it's not really a new layer of its own
but it makes it look like as if it's on
a layer of its own and we can we should
actually um should actually demonstrate
that so let's actually um float this box
um over to the left yeah whoa what is
exactly so now now it looks really weird
because all the other boxes just jumped
as if like they couldn't see this box at
all they just like jumped wanna this is
because we are now saying hey this box
one it becomes invisible to the other
boxes really any look and no longer
takes maximal space available to it so
the other box is just jump let's float
another one I want to now flip this box
and then I want two loaded left as well
ok now we disappeared completely but it
didn't disappear it's actually hiding um
let's give it a different with little oh
so now we floated both um both the box
one inbox do so what happened why did
they go to where they are um well
essentially um they that went when their
boat floated they're both
on a separate layer by themselves kind
of like you can think of it as like a
layer layer 2 and they're aware of each
other's existence but they're not aware
of the of what other boxes are not aware
of them so other boxes do not see them
and as it is as if those boxes are
taking like 00 space and so essentially
when you unload them you see how this
goes back to being on the normal normal
layer and then but when you float it it
goes back up and the other thing is that
they're also not only they're aware of
each other but they're also like this is
a little bit weird because if they're
one fluid so lets them float them and
let's also on float this they are
actually um underneath one another
they're not they're not horizontally
next to each other because they're block
elements yeah right yeah but then when
you float them that's no longer the case
right when you float them they sort of
like lose that property of like wanting
to take as much space as they can
horizontally it's sort of like um there
are no no longer it'll result
horizontally territorial yeah because
we're tell we're telling it to float
left now it's interesting if we take box
2 and we float it right let's see what
happens there if we take box too and we
do float right what do we think will
happen that's right it jumps to the
right side so you can put bangs on both
sides they're both in the float layer
and they're hiding now here's an
interesting thing what happens if we
float box one to the right also let's
see yeah look interesting notice how box
one is to the right of the green box box
too and the reason for that is box one
came before box too so it's kind of like
there's a race and the first one you say
okay float right and you get to box one
a box one goes to the right and then you
go to box 2 and you say float right but
Oh barks one is already there so it goes
as much to the right as possible this is
sort of like the first element and so
when you float it to the right it's the
first one it's going to be on the right
side and when you floated to the left
it's going to be the first one is gonna
be on the left side and then you float
elements that are come to that this is
the second element and so it's going to
follow the first element now what if
what if we have the common situation
where we like these things flow to do
what we
want everything else to come after it
like you know like we need to clear like
it's there's actually something called
clearfix we need to fix this we need to
clear all these we need to clear all the
problems with it to fix these these
floating issues so let's select um the
third box right and then let's give it a
property that's clear you're both I
think I should left it right later both
yeah boom yay look at that so now you're
essentially telling it oh you actually
you gotta be where you got to be where
because there's actually elements float
on both sides which clear boatman's on
both sides we actually we floated those
to the left so we don't have to do this
is going to be the same thing no oh
right cuz how it going to write yes okay
clear clear right works for this because
the bows those two elements are like
floated to the right so you're telling
the third box watch out you have
elements form floated to your right so
you want to be below them yeah if you
ever hear someone talking about clear
fix this is kind of the trick that you
need you can google it um there's
actually two things you need for Claire
fix you need to clear left right and you
also need to set the overflow for a
weird case where you have nested dibs so
when you look at the clear fix you'll
see it clears and it also sets an
overflow so if you don't forget just
google it and an add it and even within
bootstrap you sometimes have to be aware
of these issues too so you'll see
references to clear fix in bootstrap so
