would be some reasonable resources to
try to manage in a learning algorithm
okay well I was thinking of three
because three is my favorite number two
of them are what you already have
written up their time and space after
all at the end of the day it's still an
algorithm and we need to be able to
analyze how rhythm turns a time and
space that's right so if in particular
if we have a earning algorithm and they
do more or less the same things but one
runs in N squared time and one runs in
exponential time we'd really like to
have the one that runs in the shorter
amount of time or in particular if
there's a if we define a learning
problem and we say well we can do this
computation but it's np-hard then maybe
that's a problematic way of defining the
problem so yeah time definitely matters
space for the same reason and those are
the same things that happen in that are
relevant and regular algorithms what
about anything specific to the machine
learning setting okay so that was my
third one so the only thing that matters
in machine learning or the most
important thing in machine learning is
data so I would think that another
resource that we care about is the data
and in particular the set of training
samples that we have yeah so I like
though I like the word samples though
you know data is probably a pretty good
thing to stick in there as well or
examples those should all be okay
yes indeed yeah we want to know can we
learn well with small amount of samples
in particular if our learning algorithm
works great in terms of time and space
but in order to run it you actually have
to give examples of every possible input
then that's not going to be a very
useful algorithm so the fewer samples
that it can use the more that it's
generalizing effectively and the better
it is at learning that makes sense</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
