using numbers first we multiply both
sides by the quantity 5 plus y we
distributed the positive 3 here and then
we subtracted 15 and divided by 3 but
what if we had an equation like this one
and we wanted to solve for y notice that
this setup of these two equations are
nearly identical it turns out that we
can solve for y by following nearly the
same exact steps here instead of using
numbers though we'll have variables
first we'll multiply each side of our
equation by X plus y then we'll
distribute Z to both of these terms to
get ZX + z y equals 1/x when we're at
this step we want to isolate y remember
we wanted to solve for y or this
variable and get it by itself so we
should isolate this on one side of the
equation by subtracting ZX from both
sides will get Z Y is equal to X minus Z
times X these are not like terms so we
can't combine them the variables are
different and finally to isolate y we
divide both sides by Z this gives us
with one y equal to X minus Z times X
all divided by Z this is pretty amazing
we actually solve an equation for a
variable in terms of other variables so
in this work we really x x + y first
then we distributed the positive z to
each of these terms next we subtracted Z
X from both sides of our equation to get
the Y alone on one side and to solve for
y or to get one why we divided by Z
which gave us our final answer see if
you can look back at this work and this
work to draw comparisons between the two
they're not that much different we're
really just trying to get one variable
solved in terms of others when you're
doing the comparison think about Z as
being 3 I think about X as being five
this is a skill that might come in handy
with other courses especially when
you're trying to solve for certain
variables maybe you don't to find this
variable Z maybe you want to find X or Y
these two equations are actually the
same they just look different this
equation and this equation are actually
equivalent they just
different in form this one is soft for Z
and this one is soft for y if I knew the
values of X&amp;amp;Y I can quickly compute the
value of Z but maybe instead I really
want to find the value of y if I know
the values of x and z I can quickly find
the value of y by plugging into this
equation</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
