since way back but as time goes on more
and more data is being generated IBM
estimates that 90% of the world's data
was created in the last two years alone
just as a simple example think of your
cell phone whenever your cell phones
turned on it's connected to cell towers
as you move around it will connect to
different towers net different signal
strengths all of that connection data is
collected by the phone company and it's
being logged they can use that
information to find dead spots in the
coverage and know which towers are
busiest and need increased capacity they
can even trace you if you make an
emergency phone call but don't give your
exact location this is an enormous
amount of data we have another example
is when you visit a website like Amazon
or Netflix everything you do there is
logged what pages you view how long you
spend there where are you coming from
they can even capture things like what
browser you're using again this is a
huge amount of data phone data and
website logs are just examples in
addition things like x-rays are creating
huge amounts of data and people are
doing research to detect similarities
and tumors the increase in the amount of
data we're generating opens up huge
possibilities but it comes with problems
too we need to be able to store all this
data and process it to</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
