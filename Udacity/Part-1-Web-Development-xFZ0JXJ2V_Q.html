thing I'm going to talk about is
homework three there was a lot of
confusion I had on how to do the
permalink part which is mostly my fault
so I will explain what I what I intended
for you to do using this handy-dandy
whiteboard okay so the first thing you
need to do when you start objects so
you're gonna make a post and it's gonna
look something like this
you know you're going to be making this
post object and it has you know a title
and some contents I think that was it
but that's not the important part most
of you figured this out when you put the
post in the database in Google App
Engine you use the put command to do so
that actually stores the post of the
database and once you've stored it in
the database that's when Google App
Engine assigns that post and ID you can
also include an ID in this constructor
here when you build it but generally
it's best just to let the database do it
itself because otherwise you have to
keep track of which IDs you've used
which ones you haven't used that sort of
thing so well let Google will let Google
set the ID we'll put it in the database
and then so what we need to do is
redirect the user to the permalink page
for that post and by permalink I just
mean link to that that post so we need
to get this post ID the way you do that
is you can say P key and key is Google
App engines full kind of representation
of this object and and and this is a
whole long string and you can turn this
into an integer by calling ID on it so
this this is the integer representation
of that post and we'll convert it into a
stir part in my indentation here and
we'll assign this to a variable and what
we'll do then is we'll redirect the user
to a URL with this variable in it
something it'll look something like this
then we're going to use our string
substitutions to include us include a
little string there and this should
redirect the user to slash blog slash
the idea of this post so that's the
first part of the problem the key thing
here that you need to know is how to get
the idea of a the idea of opposed to you
to submit it now let me erase this and
then the the second part of this problem
is how do you actually look up that blog
post now you've got you URL mappers all
the URL mappers that we've done in the
class are basically static URLs you know
they have the format of something like
remember these are just a bunch of
tuples at the bottom of that file it
might look like you know slash blog and
this maps to a handler that just draws a
blog in mine and in my code I think it's
is called main page which is the Google
the default for that that first one now
what we want to do is we want to make a
special one for linking to permalinks
these strings here that represent the
URL are not just strings are actually
regular expressions we we had some
regular expressions in Unit two when we
were validating usernames and passwords
and that sort of thing
well what we want to have here is a
regular expression to capture a URL with
an integer after it and that looks
something like this so this is all just
normal string and a regular expression
you can just have you know anything
that's just kind of regular text just
matches that text exactly now have two
here we use parentheses to basically say
whatever goes in here will be passed as
a parameter to our handler function and
we can do something like this square
bracket zero through nine square bracket
plus and what this means is the square
brackets say match any character between
these square brackets and you can use
ranges like this so this basically says
find any number zero through nine and
the plus means find one or more of them
so this will basically match any URL
that starts with slash blog slash and
then any number and we'll map that to
some handler for for our permalink page
which I think in my code I may have
called post handler but you can call
that whatever you want not so that's
step two is basically do this URL
handler and may have your razor please
and then we'll talk about step three
which is fairly straightforward go
you have your handler so we'll have
something that looks like this
and this inherits from you know the
webapp2 handler or the global handler
whichever you're using and in here
you'll have a function that looks
something like this def get you know
this handles get requests now normally
this just takes one parameter called
self in this case we had parenthesis in
the URL mapper which means it's gonna
maps match with Evers in those
parentheses and pass that as a parameter
and here it so in this case it's going
to be our post ID one quick thing to
note I never call variables ID in Python
because ID is actually a function and
it's a reserved function and it's really
easy to create really subtle bugs that
you start using the word ID so all my
variables that refer to IDs always are
something underscore ID so now what we
want to do is get our post out of the
database and App Engine this would just
looks something like this P equals post
this is our our class that we defined
that that's the actual data model and
you can say yeah by ID post id and that
will do a database query to look up this
the post with this ID out of the
database and then all you need to do is
say if P and then you can render it
however you plan on doing that
and if he doesn't exist you can just
return a 404 so that's how you do the
permalink portion of the homework I hope
you guys managed to get all this working
I'm sorry I probably should have covered
get my ID in the lecture but that's the
that's the fun of teaching for the first
time so good luck everybody and thanks
for sticking with us so far</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
