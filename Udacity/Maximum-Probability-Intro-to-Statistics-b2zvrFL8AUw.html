the most transformative parts of modern
statistics and it uses things you've
likely never seen before we start out
with the binomial distribution that
you're familiar with from our last unit
and then we move into the central limit
theorem which basically means we take
the nomicon flips to infinity from that
we arrive at the normal distribution
which is basis to so much in statistics
all of testing and confidence intervals
are defined to the normal distribution
and the reason why this matters is much
of Avedon and coin flips had one or two
coin flips but in statistical
experiments you often have thousands of
patients or thousands of data points and
then studying the normal distribution is
an approximation to the binomial
distribution it's much more practical so
let's get started so I want to start
with our now well-established formula
for binomial distributions where n is
the number of coin flips K is how often
it comes up with heads and P is the
probability that the coin comes up with
heads usually 0.5 and I want to graph
for fixed n this function here K can go
from 0 all the way to 20 instead of
letting you compute this thing over here
for all those different values of K I'm
going to ask a different question
suppose we have a fair coin we do you
think this value takes on its maximum
value which value of K maximizes our
expression I know you can't really
notice but with some thought
I believe you arrive at the correct
answer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
