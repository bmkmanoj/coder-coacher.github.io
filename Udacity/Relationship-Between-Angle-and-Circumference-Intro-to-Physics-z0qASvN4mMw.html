alphas 360 degrees that means we're
looking at the entire circumference this
D would be identical to see now we're
starting to see an equation emerge this
circumference somehow depends on this
distance and this angle alpha now I
guess we'll have to add the distance to
our wish list because we don't know that
yet either and before we go any further
let's just rewrite this equation let's
solve it for see I'm going to bring this
see up here and I'm going to bring these
over alfin 360 over to the other side so
this is it this is our answer for the
circumference of the earth we just need
to know alpha and D so now let me just
talk about this equation a little bit
before we move on first of all there is
nothing wrong with the way we wrote it
before this was a totally true
expression that you could use to
calculate the circumference the reason I
like this a little better is because
well it explicitly tells us this is the
circumference and then the way we've
written it over here is nice as well i
see i have here 360 over alpha now these
are both in degrees when i do degrees
divided by degrees I get some unit list
number so this is just some multiplier
that multiplies a number with unit of
distance so i can see just by looking at
this equation that what I will get is a
unit of distance and I can see how it
depends on this distance from Alexandria
to cna and the angle of the shadow I
think that's a nice way to show this
equation now let's just worry about this
angle in the distance and keep track of
our units as we do this may require a
new mathematical tool as well now let's
go to Florence Italy to talk to an
expert in the field</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
