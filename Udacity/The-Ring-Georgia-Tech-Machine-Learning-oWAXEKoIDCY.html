down and know in a way that lets us
summarize it so I think what you're
saying is when we did that
one-dimensional case it had the VC
dimension was 1 when we did the interval
it was 2 when we did two dimensional
linear separators it was 3 and you're
wondering whether in 3 dimensions it
would be 4 yes so that's yeah that's a
really good insight let me be a little
bit more precise here that the
hypothesis space is in each of these
cases here they were defined by this
parameter theta in the interval case it
was defined by a and B in the
2-dimensional case it was defined by W
and theta and W was in two dimensions so
this was actually a vector of size 2 so
each time we went up to do a different
example we actually added another
parameter and it looks like the VC
dimension is the number of parameters
hmm so in a sense it's it's the
dimensionality of the space in which the
hypotheses live so it really it really
fits very nicely that doesn't exactly
answer your question it is the case that
for a three dimensional problem there's
going to be four dimensions and so it
turns out you are right that for any d
dimensional hyper plane concept class or
hypothesis class the VC dimension is
going to end up being d plus one oh I
see and that's because the number of
parameters that you need to represent a
d dimensional hyper plane is in fact d
plus one that's right yet d through the
weights for each of the dimensions plus
the theta you know the greater than or
equal to thing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
