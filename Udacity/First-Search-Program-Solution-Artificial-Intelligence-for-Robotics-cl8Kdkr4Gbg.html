function search which is the only
function I'm going to run in the end
it's like the main routine and to check
cells once they expand it so don't
expand them again I define an array
called closed so the same size as my
grid and it has two values 0 1 0 being
is still open one meaning is being
closed you could also use boolean so
this over here assigns an array of the
same size as the field grid I initialize
the styling location as checked and
assign the coordinates to X Y and G
value of 0 and my initial open list is
going to be this one element of my
initial coordinates in the G value of 0
so so far what I've done is I've defined
an array called closed of the same size
all the check marks are not there except
for the ones in the left corner and this
is my starting location of my open list
right over here with a G value of 0
inside my code I use two flags one is
found which will be true when the goal
position is found and one is resign
which will be true if I don't find a
goal position that and I've explored
everything the second movie with the
case of my open list just turns empty
without finally the goal that's really
important for the case where I can't
find a path to the goal those print
commands where the ones are used for
debugging you can look at them they
print out the existing open list nothing
else but here's the code I repeat the
following but I haven't found a path to
the goal and I haven't proved that the
problem is unsolvable
so both found and resign are false if my
open list is empty has nothing to expand
then resign is true and a print fail so
this is one of the two terminal
conditions you can convince yourself is
no path from s to G we will expand every
node on the left side of the barrier
until we finally run out of nodes to
expand which points the open list will
be empty and our search failed if
there's still elements on the open list
the else case comes into place and
here's how I remove the element with the
smallest g-value I use
list sort function which sorts elements
in increasing order from the smallest
g-value up and now I want to pop the
element with the smallest number
unfortunately pop pops at the end so I
just reverse the list and then pop the
element with the smallest g-value from
that list is a little bit of a trick
here it's not very elegant it's also not
very efficient but it does the job for
now that here gets me the element with
the smallest g-value and for that is
important if the G value comes first in
each of these triplets that's why I put
it first before the X and the y I then
assign the three values to X Y and G
which is my expansion again G is the
first X and by a second one third and
now I'm in the position to test whether
I reach the goal so if X is the goal 0
and Y is the goal one I'm done I call
found equals true
I print out this triplet and that gives
me the tribute over here so this print
next over here is this triplet and
that's the one I was looking for asking
you about printing exactly the solution
over here now if I'm not done yet
then here's the interesting case and
that's the meat of what I'm programming
I'm going through all the possible
actions there's four of them Delta is an
array of four different actions I apply
the action to X&amp;amp;Y with this addition
over here by applying the corresponding
Delta vector to construct X 2 and Y 2 if
X 2 falls into the grid and Y 2 falls
into the grid and X 2 y 2 is not yet
checked which is tested by this field
called closed and the grid cell is
navigable there's no obstacle here if
all these things are correct then I
found an expansion that are now add to
the open list I increment the cost from
G to G 2 by adding 1 in this case cost
is 1 and then I append the new triplet G
2 X 2 y 2 to my open list and I check
the coordinate X 2 y 2 so never expand
it again that is the recursion for
differently when I drew down this
element over here for example I looked
at possible ways the world could move in
my software
this means that what has to stay inside
the grid and the grid cell has to be
unoccupied which is this test over here
I also checked whether there's already a
checkmark at a cell which is this test
over here and if this wall was true I
added the new element to my open list
with the new G value incremented and the
new coordinates and that is exactly
happening over here I increment the G
value and added with the new coordinates
this is the key of a search island the
only remaining thing now is that I
called the search routine that prints me
out this thing over here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
