feature where a user can limit their
housing search results to be within a
specific travel time of a point that
they care about like work however how
can we give them more detail users don't
just want to know how long it will take
them to get somewhere they also care
about how they'll get there if I'm
taking the subway to work every day I
want to know that I'm not going to have
to switch trains three times take a
ferry or maybe I want to see multiple
options for roots in case the service
goes down luckily we have the ability to
get and show the user the information
they need about how they would travel
from their potential new home the
directions API much like the distance
matrix API gives us information about a
journey however instead of just the time
in duration it provides step-by-step
directions from point A to point B and
even to Point C through Z is needed many
of the same inputs can be used the
travel mode of either driving walking
bicycling or transit multiple transit
modes such as bus or train and
restrictions such as avoiding tolls
highways or fairies directions can
specify origins destinations and
waypoints as either text strings for
example Chicago or Sydney or as latitude
longitude coordinates the directions API
can return multi-part directions using a
series of waypoints or via points will
demonstrate the request and response
again through a web service request
within the browser so once again we have
the same URL route we're using the
directions service this time and we're
specifying we want our output in JSON
format now we need the required
parameters for directions API we need a
single origin and destination pair we
can make them specific like lat long
coordinates or very general like cities
which would then use the city center
finally you need your API key before we
look at the response let's talk about
other possible inputs to this request
this particular request would default to
show us driving directions from the
center of Brooklyn to the Google New
York City office as with before we can
optionally add in a travel mode and a
bunch of other things the instruct
notes has a link to our documentation
with a more complete list let's set our
mode to transit since I'm probably going
to take the subway or bus to work when
I'm using transit again I can specify
the transit mode for example subway I
can also specify the transit routing
preference whether I want less transfers
less walking etc I usually choose less
walking contrary to many of my Fitbit
wearing friends we can also again use
bicycling so that we have a scenic bike
ride to the office but if I do that I'm
going to want to stop along the way
luckily I can add multiple waypoints
let's say I wanted to stop off at my
favorite bakery then continue on to work
I can use the waypoints parameter to
specify an additional destination which
is taken into account as a stop in my
route alternatively if I just wanted to
pass by and smell the bakery I can
specify via instead of waypoints and
then my route won't consider it an extra
leg it'll just take me by the place so
let's execute this request and see what
kind of stuff we get back first I'm
going to execute my transit route with
my subway specified and less walking
specified as with the rest of these
service requests we get a status okay is
the one we want if the request had
failed status would not be okay and you
wouldn't see a route in your response
next we'll see the geocoded waypoints
this is essentially taking our origin
destination and any additional waypoints
and making sure the service was able to
successfully find that location it gives
us the lat Long's as well we only see
two points here since we had no way
points this is our origin and our
destination the next thing we'll see is
the route data itself so let's expand
this there will only be one leg if you
didn't specify anyway points but the
route will be split into multiple legs
if you did specify waypoints each leg
has a duration and a distance and a
start and end location each leg also has
one or more steps a step being the
smallest unit of instruction for example
walk to kingston throop avenue
each step also has a distance and
adoration so there's some very granular
data here each leg also has an overview
polyline this is what will allow us to
display the root in our map finally we
see any warnings for example if there's
no walking or biking paths and you
specified bicycling the response will
tell you that let's execute our biking
request with the Waypoint to see the
difference in their response so the
first thing you'll notice is that we
have three geocoded waypoints here one
for our origin one for our destination
and one for our Waypoint we also have
two legs unlike last time where we had
one leg the first leg here will be from
our origin to our way point which is
Tompkins Square bagels by the way it's
delicious the second leg will be from
the bakery to my office as we talked
about going from point A to point B and
making stops along the way it sounds a
lot like the Traveling Salesman problem
or he has to plan his journey to cover a
number of different clients at different
locations in the most efficient way the
good news is the directions API can do
that for you to hear will execute
walking directions using three waypoints
notice that their pipe delimited in this
request the response will have four legs
and the order of the points is in the
order that we specify them in the
request but you can add in the optimized
true prefix when you specify waypoints
what this does is it will do the
planning for you to cover all the stops
in the most optimized way this means
that the result may change the order of
the waypoints from how you originally
provided them in the request notice now
the order is different our first address
was 350 fifth ave but our first stop is
actually going to be 165 avenue a it's
optimized it for us</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
