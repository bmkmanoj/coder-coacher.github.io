are desirable the second property is
desirable so the first property is not
desirable that if the hash function
outputs a unique number for every
keyword well then the range for the hash
function would be very large we need a
huge amount of memory to store the hash
table and the number of buckets would be
the same as the number of keywords
that's not going to work very well what
we want is the number of buckets to be
be so that means that the output of the
hash function should be in the range
between 0 and B minus one that will find
the element of the list that corresponds
to that bucket so we do want the second
property the third and the fourth
properties say that we want the number
of keywords in each bucket to be
approximately the same so if there are K
keywords and we're fitting them into B
buckets if we want the buckets to be
approximately the same size then each
bucket should have approximately k
divided by B keywords so both the third
and the fourth property are true the
final property says that we should have
more keywords in buckets 0 than in
bucket one there's no reason that we
would prefer that so you might think it
would be better to have more keywords at
the beginning then later on that's not
the case with a hash table remember what
our hash function does is tells us right
away which bucket to go through we don't
have to look through the earlier buckets
this is different from the list index
that we started with where the first one
is the fastest one to find and the last
one requires going through all the
elements for the hash table that's not
the case there's no reason to prefer
having more entries in bucket 02 bucket
one what we really want is to try to
have all the buckets have approximately
the same number of keywords</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
