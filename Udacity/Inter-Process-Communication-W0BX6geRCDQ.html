processes interact and the simple answer
to this is yes an operating system must
provide mechanisms to allow processes to
interact with one another and today in
fact more and more of the applications
we see are actually structured as
multiple processes so these multiple
processes have to be able to interact to
contribute to a common goal of a more
complex multi process application for
instance here is an example of a web
application consisting of two processes
on the same machine the first one is the
web server the front-end that accepts
the customer request and the second one
is the back-end the database that stores
customer profiles and other information
this is a very common case in many
enterprise and web applications so how
many's processes interact
now before we answer that remember that
the operating systems go through a great
deal to protect and isolate processes
from one another each of them is a
separate address space they control the
amount of CPU each process gets which
memories allocated and accessible to
which process so these communication
mechanisms that we will talk about
somehow have to be built around those
protection mechanisms these kinds of
mechanisms are called inter process
communication mechanisms or we refer to
them as IPC the IPC mechanisms help
transfer data and information from one
address space to another while
continuing to maintain the protection
and isolation that operating systems are
trying to enforce also different types
of interactions between processes may
exhibit different properties periodic
data exchanges continues stream of data
flowing between the processes or
coordinated update to some shared single
piece of information because of all
these differences IPC mechanisms need to
provide flexibility as well as clearly
performance one mechanism that operating
systems support is message passing IPC
the operating system establishes a
communication channel like a shared
buffer for an
and the processes interact with it by
writing or sending a message into that
buffer or reading or receiving a message
from that shared communication channel
so it's message passing because every
process has to put the information that
it wants to send to the other process
explicitly in a message and then to send
it to this dedicated communication
channel the benefits of this approach is
that it's really the operating system
who will manage this channel and it's
the operating system that provides the
exact same ap is the exact same system
calls for writing or sending data in the
reading or receiving data from this
communication channel the downside is
the overheads every single piece of
information that we want to pass between
these two processes we have to copy from
the user space of the first process into
this channel that's sitting in the OS in
the kernel memory and then back into the
address space of the second process the
other type of IPC mechanism is what we
call shared memory IPC the way this
works is the operating system
establishes the shared memory channel
and then it Maps it into the address
space of both processes the processes
are then allowed to directly read and
write from this memory as if they would
to any memory location that's part of
their virtual address space so the
operating system is completely out of
the way in this case that in fact is the
main advantage of this type of IPC that
the operating system is not in the fast
path of the communication so the
processes while they're communicating
are not going to incur any kind of
overheads from the operating system the
disadvantage of this approach is because
the operating system is out of the way
it no longer supports fixed and
well-defined
ap is how this particular shared memory
region is used for that reason it's
usage sometimes becomes more error-prone
or developers simply have to
re-implement code to use the shared
memory region in a correct way</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
