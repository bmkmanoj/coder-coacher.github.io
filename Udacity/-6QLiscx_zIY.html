average number of minutes students spend
in the classroom during their first week
right now I have a bunch of engagement
records for different students and
they're not in any particular order
first I'd like to separate out the
engagement records into groups where
each group contains all the engagement
records for a particular student I'll
represent these groups using a
dictionary where the keys are student
account keys and the values are lists of
engagement records for that student next
I'll compute the total number of minutes
spent in the classroom by each student
by sending up the number of minutes in
each engagement record for that student
finally I'll compute the average of the
totals to get the answer I'm looking for
now I'll show you the code I used to
solve this problem first I created the
dictionary i mentioned to group
engagement data by the account key you
can see that I use the default dicked
here instead of a vanilla dictionary if
you haven't seen pythons default dicks
before that's okay it allows you to
specify a default value in this case
I've specified the list that means if I
ever try to look up a key in the
dictionary and that key is not there
I'll get the empty list instead you'll
see how this will be helpful in a minute
then I looped through each engagement
record and saved the account key in this
variable next I looked up the list of
engagement records for that account key
here's where the default dicked comes in
handy if I had never added that account
key yet then I get the empty list then i
append this engagement record to the
list of engagement records for that
account key next I wanted to add up the
number of minutes visited by each
account and I decided to save that in
this dictionary so this dictionary will
store a number for each account key
instead of a list of engagement records
next I looped over the dictionary I
created previously and by looping over
the DA items I got both the key and the
value for each entry in the dictionary
for each account the number of minutes
starts as zero next I loop over each
engagement record in the list of
engagement records for that student and
I add the number of minutes that student
visited in that engagement record to the
total number of minutes for the student
finally I store that number of minutes
under that account key in the new
dictionary now I'm ready to take the
average of those totals and for that the
account keys are no longer relevant I'm
just interested in the numbers
themselves so I'll use the dot values
method to get out just the values from
that dictionary now I could calculate
the mean by hand but instead I'm going
to use a library called numpy to do it
you'll be seeing a lot of numpy later in
this course and I've imported it using
the line import numpy as NP adding as NP
allows me to later refer to the numpy
library as NP instead of referring to it
as numpy it's just a little shorter and
easier to type you don't have to do this
but lots of code posted online will have
this convention so it's good to have
seen it before then I can take the mean
by calling NP mean and passing in the
total minutes and I see that the average
number of minutes spent was 647 I'm
interested in knowing more than just the
mean here though I'd also like to know
what's the standard deviation what's the
minimum and what's the maximum it turns
out numpy has functions to calculate
those as well they're NP STD and Pittman
and NP max now you might know that
Python actually also has a min and max
function that you can use without
importing the numpy library you'll learn
later why you might want to use none
pies version instead but for now I'm
just going to go ahead and use it since
I've already imported the library and
when i run this i see that the standard
deviation is pretty large larger than
the mean the minimum is zero and the
maximum is about 10,000 minutes that's a
huge maximum and in fact there's got to
be a problem here because when you
calculate it out that's actually
slightly more than the total number of
minutes in one week so something has
gone wrong</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
