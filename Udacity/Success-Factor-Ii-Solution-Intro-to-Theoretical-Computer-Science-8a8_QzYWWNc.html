this one was very easy to get but I'll
explain the answer to you of course as
well so at least one variable must be
flipped and the chances of flipping the
right variable are at least one-third
and I'll explain it to you now let's say
we have one clause and that clause has
three variables and it's not satisfied
so if the overall boolean formula has a
satisfying assignment this means that in
the satisfying assignment either this
variable here this one here or this one
here must evaluate to true and currently
they all evaluate to false so at least
one of those variables must be flipped
in order to satisfy the clause what are
the chances that we're flipping the
correct variable meaning that we indeed
choose the variable to flip that would
also have a different value in the
satisfying assignment well since we
select one out of three variables those
chances are at least one-third so they
are exactly one third if in a satisfying
assignment you have exactly one variable
that evaluates to true or a variable
that is set to false whether or not and
the chances are even better if in the
satisfying assignment you would have two
or three variables that would need to
evaluate to true but there are always at
least one third we initially can expect
to get about half of the variables right
and a random change will be successful
or a random change in a class that is
not satisfied will be successful with
the probability of at least one third
and that of course also means that the
probability of making a mistake meaning
that we flip a variable that we should
actually not have flipped is at most two
thirds</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
