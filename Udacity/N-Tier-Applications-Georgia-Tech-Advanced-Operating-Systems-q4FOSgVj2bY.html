entir applications because if you look
at the software stack that comprises an
application such as this you'll see
several different layers you have a
presentation layer and the presentation
layer is the one that is responsible for
painting the screen on your browser
perhaps dynamically generating the page
based on the request you made and they
may be application logic that
corresponds to what the service is
providing and there is business logic
that corresponds to the way airfares
decided seats are allocated all these
kinds of things and there is a database
layer that accesses the database that
contains information about all the
things that the application of the
business logic have to decide on in
order to satisfy a particular request
and all these different layers have to
worry about many of the issues that we
are already familiar with in the context
of writing parallel programs and
distributed programs and those include
persistence for actions for example
let's say I've made a choice but I
haven't completed the booking I may go
away and come back later on in order to
complete that booking so persistence is
something that I might need you need a
notion of transaction because I've
initiated a particular operation and I
have not completed it and so
transactional properties may be needed
in order to make sure that a reservation
that started is finally complete and
I've made the booking cashing of data
that you pulled in from a database
server so that you can access the
database more quickly clustering which
corresponds to taking a set of related
services and clustering it together in
order to improve the performance of the
service and similarly clustering the
data that you're accessing from a
database server all of these are issues
and of course one of the things that we
worry about a lot these days in
e-commerce a security in particular when
we are communicating
financial information credit card
information and personal information
like Social Security IDs and so on we
worry a lot about services provided by
the server and that my personal
information is not compromised in any
fashion so these are all the sets of
issues that entire applications have to
worry about and making sure that the
services that provides a trustworthy
from an end users point of view so how
do we structure an entire application
like this the things that we want to
reduce is reduce the amount of network
communication because that results in
latency reduce security risks for the
users which means that the business
logic should not be compromised and
increase the concurrency for handling an
individual requests for instance this is
an individual request but in processing
this request there's an opportunity to
exploit parallelism oftentimes these are
called embarrassingly parallel
applications because even though those
requests seems like a single request
there's an opportunity to exploit
parallelism and the kind of parallelism
is embarrassingly parallel because the
same query I want to find out the
availability of seats on a particular
date I don't care about which airline I
go by that's an opportunity for
parallelism for the Expedia server to go
in parallel to multiple Airlines and
find out the availability of seats on
the dates that I've requested similarly
there is opportunity for exploiting
concurrency across several simultaneous
requests that are coming in and also for
clustering the computation that may have
to be done on the server for
computations that are common across
simultaneously arriving requests we want
to reuse components aggressively but
components we mean portions of the
application logic that can be reused in
constructing these applications as well
as the execution of the components in
order to service the requests that are
coming in simultaneously from several
different clients</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
