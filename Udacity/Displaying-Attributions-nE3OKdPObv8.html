consider before this place picker
integration is complete and that is
attributions when displaying data from
the google places i pay for android such
as autocomplete results or place name
and address there are some attribution
and google local requirements that you
must comply with the requirements apply
to the place picker UI widget as well as
any programmatic api calls so if your
app has retrieved a place via the place
picker and then shows this data on a
follow up screen without a map the app
must also show attributions on this
follow-up screen so we have the powered
by google image included in the google
repository in the correct sizes that you
need for android apps you can reference
it directly by name as powered by google
and then light or dark depending on if
you're using a light background or a
dark one respectively but note that this
powered by google resource is just an
image and therefore this text will not
be localized so you can see our
integration for attributions in the
github commit linked below or you can
feel free to play with the layouts and
where you would want to place an
attribution image there are also special
considerations for attributions for
third-party content so be sure to check
the documentation linked in the
instructor notes for more information
and if you would like to see what else
the places API has to offer there's a
link in the instructor notes for you as
well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
