need to think about as we just talked
about they're physical resources
financial resources human resources and
intellectual resources let's take a look
at each one of these for physical
resources these might seem at first kind
of the obvious is your company's
facilities and that is office space
company location are you in downtown
Palo Alto or are you in Ann Arbor
Michigan or you were in Delft in the
Netherlands or a Santiago where's the
best place to locate your company's
headquarters and we're gonna do most of
the work the second part of physical
resources where are you gonna get the
supply for your products and services so
for example if you're making silicon
well who's gonna be your silicon wafer
supplier in the value chain or if you're
making steel where you're gonna get the
iron ore or are you need thousands of
square feet of warehouse space if you're
gonna set up a distribution center and
what's really interesting is this kind
of obviously effects we're gonna put
your company facilities maybe you want
to have your manufacturing facility next
to the city supplier or you might say
okay we understand they're distant and
we can manage that remotely but you need
to actually think through not only this
relationship but as you'll see the
relationship between resources and the
partners part of the business model
canvas because some of these supplies
and services require deep relationships
not just ordering out of a catalogue but
true partnerships now the other thing to
just remember is many physical goods if
you're in a physical channel are capital
intensive which is a fancy word for
saying doing a start-up like Tesla or
SpaceX it's very different than doing a
iOS or Android app the amount of
resources you're going to need for
physical goods just are dramatically
different and when you're thinking about
the finance component you want to really
think about what happens after year one
year two etc how do you scale this
business and in the second decade of the
21st century a good number of clean tech
startups and the life sciences startups
are now encountering this phenomenon is
it works great as a start-up but there's
a valley of death for capital and scale</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
