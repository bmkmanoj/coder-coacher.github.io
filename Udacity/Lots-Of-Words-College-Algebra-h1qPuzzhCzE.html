information we care about is to keep in
mind what we're looking for in the
problem since we want to find out how
much one set of wiper blades costs to
make the total amount of money that
grant has spent on my production so far
definitely matters as does the total
number of wiper sets that that money
five hundred ninety-eight dollars funded
grants lunch with his friends does not
affect the materials that I needs for a
set of wipers so I'm not going to check
this one off it doesn't actually matter
for this problem and this last choice
that we have left to consider has to do
with nozzles alone not wipers and as you
can see from the question wipers are
what we're concerned with we can tell
already from this list and the fact that
half of the answers aren't checked off
that a lot of times situations that pop
up are full of information that is it
relevant to the problem we're trying to
solve and the first step in solving
problems is to make sure we identify
what we need to pay attention to and
what we can ignore to make our lives
