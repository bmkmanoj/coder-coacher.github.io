SNP quiz we want to have a lot of course
with this type of architecture so what
are the problems that will have to face
the memory will need to be large and
slow and that's because having more
cores usually means that we will be
running programs that access more data
and we need to keep the data summer so
we will need to have a large memory and
that makes the memory slot next that
memory will get too many accesses per
second because the cache misses from all
of the course will be going to memory if
one of the core generates cache misses
that the memory can survive doing two of
them it might still survive but if we
have a lot of course our memory will
probably not be able to keep up with all
of those accesses will need a lot of
small memory modules not necessarily the
number of memory modules in a
centralized memory doesn't matter what
is really needed is to have enough
memory for all the course to get enough
data in there and the memory that will
keep up with the bandwidth demands of
the course how many modules we have
doesn't really matter caches will have
very small block size this is not true
either all of the caches in all of the
course can have any block size they want
the block size is not divided among the
course pages for virtual memory become
too small same thing we can have any
page size we want having more or fewer
course doesn't affect the page size in
virtual memory so the only options you
should have selected are the first tool</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
