DB Lakota in transfer mode the traffic
is protected end to end well as internal
mold the traffic is protected between
the gateway of one network to the gate
weight of another network first let's
consider the end-to-end or transfer mode
policy from A to B suppose the policy
says that for any traffic from A to B
the packets need to be authenticated and
further the suggested algorithm is to
use H Mac with md5 as the embedded hash
function
this policy is stored as an entry in SPD
the negotiated parameters between a.m.
be a store in SA in both a.m. PS sa DB
for SAS a DB is stores a secret key for
each Mac and SPI
for looking up the essay in peace sa DB
then when a sends out traffic to be he
can include this SPI in IPSec header so
the P can use it to look up the essay
and unprocessed the traffic now let's
take a look at a tunnel mode traffic
from the subnet that a belongs to
through some net the P belongs to
suppose the policy says that for any
traffic from a subnet to be some net the
tunnel destination is piece gateway
which is D and a data should be
encrypted
therefore ESP should be used and further
chuubo des is requested since C is the
gateway of the subnet that a belongs to
sis SPD stores this policy and it's este
DB stores the SI that has the Chabot DES
key and SPI for looking up si in these
si dB</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
