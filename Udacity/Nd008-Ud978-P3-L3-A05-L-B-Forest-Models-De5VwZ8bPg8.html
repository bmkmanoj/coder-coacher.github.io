consider a really simplified version of
the example we just talked about we
generated a force model in order to
predict the unknown data from the
employees who did not respond let's
apply this model to a particular
employee who lives 1.5 miles away from
work to illustrate how the force model
will work remember the trees here are
simplified to demonstrate the concept
for the first tree a random sample of
the data is taken and a tree is created
from it here is the tree since the
employee we were trying to predict lose
1.5 miles away this tree would predict
that she has a fifty percent chance of
driving to work thirty percent chance of
taking public transportation and a
twenty percent chance of walking or
biking now another tree is generated
from a different random sample here is
that tree in this tree or employee is
predicted to have a twenty percent
chance of driving thirty percent chance
of using public transportation and a
fifty percent chance of walking or
biking a third tree is generated from a
different random sample here is that
tree now in this tree our employee is
predicted to have a thirty percent
chance of driving twenty percent chance
of using public transit and a fifty
percent chance of walking or biking in a
force model hundreds of trees like this
would be creative and then the results
of each would be average to make a
prediction let's average based off these
three trees to make a prediction so
driving is fifty percent plus twenty
percent plus thirty percent divided by
three so it's thirty three percent
likely to be driving the public transit
was thirty percent thirty percent and
twenty percent when you divide that by
three that's twenty-seven percent likely
to be public transportation and then
walking and biking had it twenty percent
fifty percent and a fifty percent chance
divided by 3 which equals forty percent
so you can see that if we had only used
the first treat that because of
overfitting it may have had a very
different prediction than the forest
model it would have predicted most
likely our employee drove by using a
forest technique it predicted the Shema
slightly walked our bite</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
