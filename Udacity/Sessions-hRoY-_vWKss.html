data for all sessions a session
indicates a period of continuous use for
your app and it's a key concept in
Google Analytics so if you use your app
for a while say for a few minutes and
then you put it down let's say looking
at dinner suggestions makes you hungry
so you go get an ice cream then you eat
your ice cream takes you about 10
minutes and then you go back to your app
let's say you've been away from the app
for 10 minutes so when you go back to
the app you're actually in the same
session it's all been considered one
continuous session because it's been
less than 30 minutes of continuous use
even though you actually stopped using
it for 10 minutes but let's suppose now
that you take a longer break and you go
for a much bigger ice cream that's going
to take you longer to eat but again even
though you ate the whole ice cream is
still hungry so you're going to go back
to your app now let's say you were gone
from your app this time for 31 minutes
in this case when you go back to the app
you're going to be in a new session
because the default period of time for a
session is 30 minutes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
