you're responsible for is spending 1 to
3 hours per week free every team and
you're going to be working with 1 to 4
teams for up to 3 weeks and we encourage
you to meet up once a week in person and
or once a week online per team with
Skype or Google hangout but we're really
looking for is you to offer your
critiques and your expertise in there
launchpad central narratives as they
start talking about the customers
they're actually interacting with we
want you to offer comments was this the
right interaction what should they have
learned should they have done something
different you need to actually be giving
them feedback you need to be giving them
contacts people to talk to and sharing
all your domain expertise this is not
just kind of I showed up as a mentor
this is a full time engagement with
these teams so think of yourself is
almost there venture investor assume you
just put a substantial fraction of your
net worth into these teams care like
that let me be clear though we don't
want you to do their work for them but
we want you to guide them to the right
places to talk to to see the right
patterns in the data and to understand
what you understand</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
