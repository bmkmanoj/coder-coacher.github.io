coffee maker from the beginning of this
lesson we wanted to program a coffee
maker that gets us our favorite cup of
coffee to build this our coffee machine
needs to know who's asking for coffee
and then we can give it instructions to
select the right coffee for that person
each person will choose a three digit
passcode that they can enter into the
coffeemaker to get their favorite cup
I've chosen my passcode to be 555 which
will get me an espresso or if you prefer
something with flavor you could enter 3
1 2 and get this delicious vanilla latte
everyone has their own preference and
the more passcodes our coffee maker
knows the smarter it will be now let's
get into programming this behavior for
our smart coffee machine we want to
check the value of an int variable
called passcode and test it for equality
against a list of specific values that
it can take pass codes like 555 for me
and my espresso and 3 1 2 for a sir in
his vanilla latte and let's include one
more pass code six to nine that makes a
drip coffee we can program this behavior
using a series of decision-making
statements let's say we have access to
our int passcode variable but we aren't
sure what value will be we just know
that it will be some three-digit number
we can then write an if statement and
else ifs with test conditions that check
if our passcode is equal to a certain
value like 555 or three one two and then
inside each statement we'll assign what
type of coffee to make based on the
value of passcode and the type of coffee
is kept track of in a string variable
coffee type then at the very end of our
code will print out the value of coffee
type so if we look at our first if in
detail it tests if our passcode is equal
to five five five and we test for
equality with this double equal sign and
the value 555 corresponds to our
espresso passcode then if this test
condition is true we'll enter our if
block of code and set coffee type to the
value espresso then because we've
executed the code in our if we'll skip
down to the end curly brace of all these
statements to our print line of code and
this will just print out espresso and
the rest of this code works similarly we
check if the passcode is equal to three
one two
if it's not we then check if it's equal
to six to nine and if it's not equal to
any of these our coffee type will be set
to unknown but this type of code can get
really long for multiple pass code
checks and we're doing a similar check
for equality in each of these test
conditions
we're same pass code equals equals some
specific value and Java gives us another
way to write this code with a switch
statement a switch statement does the
same thing a little more concisely it
lets us check the value of a certain
variable like our pass code and test it
for equality against a list of possible
values it can take like five five five
three one two and six to nine each of
these specific values is called a case
and we can program different behavior
for each case in Java this switch
statement looks like this
it says switch followed by the variable
it wants to check for equality
surrounded by parentheses then it has
curly braces that will contain all of
our equality checks and our equality
checks are just these specific cases
which here are the specific three-digit
pass codes that our program knows 555
three one two and six to nine our first
if statement here will execute the same
code as our case five five five here the
value of our pass code will be checked
for equality against the number five
five five and if it matches we'll set
our coffee type string to be equal to
espresso and that's the same thing we
did in our first if but if our pass code
is not equal to five five five then
we'll move on to our next case just like
we'd move on to our next else if in case
three one two and case six to nine
correspond to our else--if code this
case checks for pass code is equal to
three one two if it is we set our coffee
type to be vanilla latte if it's not we
move on to our next case just like we'd
move on to our next else if so these
three cases check for our three known
pass code values and if our pass code
matches any one of these values we'll
enter the corresponding case code and
set our coffee type to the correct
coffee value notice that after each case
is defined like case three one two we
write a colon not a semicolon and then
the instructions we want our program to
execute which is to give us
value to our coffee type string and this
is the format for all our cases the word
case the specific value we want to check
for equality a colon and then the code
we want to execute after each case is
this word break a break happens after
code inside a case executes it breaks
out of the switch statement and goes to
its ending curly brace
so having breaks after each case ensures
that only one of these blocks of code
will execute this is just like how only
one block of code in a series of ifs and
else ifs will execute at a time the
break we'll break out of our
decision-making code and go to the end
of our ending curly brace where it will
print out the value of coffee type
there's also a default case that acts
the same as an else statement the
default code will execute whenever our
other cases aren't met like if the pass
code was something like 9 1 4 and we
don't recognize it or don't have a case
for it so both of these sets of code do
the same thing in fact if our pass code
was 5 5 5 the print output for both of
these codes would be espresso for this
code it would enter our first if
statement and set coffee type to
espresso and for this code it would
check the value of our pass code against
our first case case 5 5 5 and because
these match it would enter this code and
set our coffee type to espresso again so
switch statements can be implemented
with ifs and else's but it can be easier
and more understandable to write code in
a switch if you're doing a lot of
equality checks and as a programmer it's
up to you to decide what to use to make
your code easy to understand and use
let's get some more practice with switch
statements</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
