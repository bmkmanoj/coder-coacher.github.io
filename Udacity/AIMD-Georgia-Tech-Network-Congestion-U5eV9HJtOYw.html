multiplicative decrease congestion
control algorithm the algorithm is
distributed meaning that all the senders
can act independently and we've just
shown using the phase plots that it's
both fair and efficient to visualize
this sending rate over time the sender's
sending rate looks roughly as shown we
call this the TCP sawtooth behavior or
simply the TCP sawtooth TCP periodically
probes for available bandwidth by
increasing its rate using additive
increase when the sender reaches a
saturation point by filling up a buffer
in a router somewhere along the path it
will see a packet loss at which point it
will decrease its sending rate by half
you can now see that a TCP sender sends
at a sending rate shown by the dotted
green line that is halfway between the
maximum window size at which the sender
sends and half that rate which it backs
off to when it sees a loss you can see
that between the lowest sending rate and
the highest is WM over two plus one
round trips now given that rate we can
compute the number of packets between
periods of packet loss and compute the
loss rate from this the number of
packets sent for every packet lost is
the area of this triangle the loss rate
is on the order of the square of the
maximum window divided by some constant
now the throughput is the average rate
3/4 w max divided by the RTT now if we
want to relate the throughput to the
loss rate where we call the loss rate P
and the throughput lambda we simply need
to solve for W m and I'm just going to
get rid of the constant so a loss occurs
once for this number of packets so the
loss rate is simply 1 over that quantity
and then when we solve for W m and plug
in for throughput we see that the
throughput
is inversely proportional to both the
round-trip time and the square root of
the loss rate</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
