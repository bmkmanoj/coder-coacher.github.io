if better we could solve all the three
problems we have looked at so far in
polynomial time we could solve vertex
cover we could solve independent set and
we could solve clique in polynomial time
now the theoretical computer scientists
like to divide problems into so called
complexity classes and a complexity
class basically contains all problems
that can be solved on a given machine
within a specified time or specified
memory or even both but we're going to
stick with time for now so if we draw
this as a matrix and put time here and
the Machine here then so far we have
learned about two different types of
time we have learned about polynomial
time and we have learned about
exponential time and we have the normal
RAM the model that has basically the
same capabilities as any computer that
you know and we have just learned about
the RAM that has the if-better function
available each of these fields here in
the matrix is a complexity class so this
field here for example would contain all
problems that can be solved in
exponential time on a normal Ram so
vertex cover independent set and clique
would all be contained in this class but
of course they can also be contained in
other classes and I would actually like
you to figure this out as our next quiz
and the question is in which other
complexity classes so this one here this
one here or this one here can we put our
three problems vertex cover independent
set and clique and I would like you to
make a check mark if you're sure that we
can put these problems into that
complexity class if you're sure that we
can not do that or if we are not certain
I want you to leave that field blank</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
