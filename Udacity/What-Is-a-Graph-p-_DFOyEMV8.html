wait no I've been conditioned to think
of a graph as a chart that shows trends
like a line graph or a graph of a
function but that's not what we're
talking about here let me try again our
definition of a graph looks more like
this the purpose of a graph is to show
how different things are connected to
one another it's also sometimes called a
network a graph is similar to a tree in
many ways for starters these are called
nodes or vertices and these lines over
here are called edges in fact a tree is
just a more specific type of graph it's
just like a binary tree is a type of
tree and a BST is a type of binary tree
here's an example of a valid graph where
you can really start anywhere and you'll
follow some path back to the start since
cycles like this one are possible graphs
don't really have a root node like trees
do graphs are really vaguely defined but
we should keep it that way as you've
probably come to expect we need to keep
it vague so our definition will
encompass all of the different use cases
for a graph for example I would love to
say that nodes are the parts of graphs
that store data and edges are just the
connections between them but edges can
actually store data too since graphs can
seem really abstract at the start let's
make them more concrete with some
examples let's imagine this graph as a
social network this node can be me I can
draw the rest of the graph like this
here it's clear that nodes are people
but the edges between the nodes could be
describing any connection between us
maybe it's people who've met each other
here two notes that are connected by an
edge sometimes called adjacent have met
each other in person this could be a
graph of people who've lived in the same
city at the same time or people who've
worked on a project together the nodes
could contain any amount of data like
each person's full name where they live
now their birthday etc as I said before
edges could contain data two edges often
contain data about the strength of a
connection for example these edges could
show how many times in the past week we
talked to
each other okay let's think about a new
example let's say this graph is my
travel plans for a big trip I'm going to
fly from San Francisco to Tokyo
then Kuala Lumpur then Delhi then back
to KL Tokyo and SF the edges could
contain no information or they could
contain how long the flights are the
information I decide to store will
depend on what I'm using this graph for</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
