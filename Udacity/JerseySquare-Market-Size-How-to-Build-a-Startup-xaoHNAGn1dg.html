four-page Business School analysis
though if you've went to business school
feel free to do the analysis but it
really is at first a
back-of-the-envelope calculation is this
business worth doing so we just kind of
have you constantly checking about three
things and let's take a look at the
Jersey square team in and think about
how they approach this if you remember
we asked you to talk about the total
available market or total addressable
market which really is a fancy word to
say is how big is the universe of
everybody potentially who could use the
product and in this case they said well
even in the United States they're 150
Americans who watch the five majors team
sports in some capacity okay well can we
sell to 150 million people not really
because the next thing we want to look
at is what we call the served available
market how many can I reach with my
sales channel so let's see how the
Jersey square team looked at the served
available market they said in the New
York metro area there were 11 million
people who watched the 5 major sports
teams in some capacity what they really
should have done is said that but then
said how many of them have a web browser
and how many of them will we actually be
able to reach within some period of time
and with some semblance of cash and the
next thing they were looking at was
their target market who will be their
most likely buyers and they did some
research at Yankee Stadium and said 11
or 12 percent of the served available
market showed strong interest and they
said well that means just in the New
York area 1.3 million people should be
interested in a subscription or rental
really again if they were doing analysis
for real they should have said but how
many of them can we reach with a web
browser and then how many of them can we
actually get with our acquisition and
activation campaign and what falls out
of this if you actually take it to the
next level is what's a reasonable
assumption of year 1 2 &amp;amp; 3 revenue just
back-of-the-envelope ok so these are the
people gee subscription and half pay
rental let's do some math on my first
year's revenue should be 300 million
dollars nope I think I'm being a little
too optimistic at least you'll start
with a series of calculations that you
could bounce off advisors and friends
and co-founders and say
you know are we even in the ballpark of
making an interesting business one of
the things to keep in mind is that no
startup has ever exceeded their
optimistic estimates of market size so
if your numbers are coming in too low of
potential customers I wouldn't give up I
would just be going back and looking at
the customer segments you're targeting
and understand whether you want to build
the business or have a hobby</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
