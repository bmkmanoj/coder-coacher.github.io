can travel in one nanosecond they'll be
instructions on the website how you can
do this for other operating systems but
you'll see a window like this appear
that will tell you what kind of
processor you have and if you zoom that
a little bit you can see that it says we
have a 2.7 ghz intel core processor what
ghz stands for is gigahertz which means
we can do 2.7 billion cycles in each
second so that means the time we have
for one cycle is actually less than a
nanosecond and you can think of a cycle
as the time the computer has to do one
step so it does one step 2.7 billion
times in a second that means the time
for each cycle is 1/2 point 7
nanoseconds so that means in the time
the computer has for one cycle light
travels 11.1 centimeters so how far is
that so let's have a little scale here
if we have a dollar bill that's actually
quite a bit longer than 11.1 centimeters
11.1 centimeters is about three quarters
of the way across the bill so within the
time light can travel that distance the
computers gotta finish processing one
cycle finish at least part of an
instruction this should give you some
idea of how fast the computer's
operating and this is part of the reason
a processor has to be so small if the
processor was bigger than 11 centimeters
we couldn't even send light across the
processor in the time from one cycle</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
