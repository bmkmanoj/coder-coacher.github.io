last three answers all of them now why
is that well the first answer says
there's no genetic component at all we
just saw in some of the previous
exercises that there's a concordance
rate between monozygotic twins
indicating a genetic component just
because we didn't find anything in this
study doesn't actually mean there's not
a genetic component it could be that
there are so many alleles with each
individual Leo having a very small
effect that we need even bigger studies
more than just thousands maybe tens of
thousands or hundreds of thousands of
people for us to identify the alleles
that have the effect we could also be
looking at the wrong variations perhaps
we need more snv's to look at or maybe
that there are bigger mutations that we
need to focus on like chromosomal
translocations or gene duplications
deletions insertions these aren't
detectable by just looking at single
nucleotide changes and there could
always be more complicated hereditary
processes hiding simple genetic effects
if there's anything this lesson has
taught you I hope it's that there are
many traits that are complex and they
don't fit our simple rules of dominant
and recessive and while this can make it
really difficult to understand or follow
it's what gives us all of the beautiful
uniqueness of each human being on the
planet</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
