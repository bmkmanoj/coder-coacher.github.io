software developers much easier by
streamlining the process to deploy
software
so what's virtualization anyway virtual
machines also known as virtual servers
are fully fledged computers with CPU
memory and storage but it's all virtual
or simulated not physical
they have operating systems files and
applications they don't necessarily live
inside a physical server on a one-to-one
ratio in fact several virtual machines
can live within a single physical server
to the outside world there's really no
difference between a physical server and
a virtual server they both can serve up
websites host applications and contain
data you can spin up a virtual machine
on a desktop PC on a server or in the
cloud why would you want to use virtual
machines let's look at a few use cases
say you want to set up a testing
environment that it is a mirror image of
production virtual machines will allow
you to do this quickly and securely you
can also run single purpose virtual
machines to support a database
authentication services or log
aggregation you can use virtual machines
to create high availability clusters and
minimize downtime by using virtual
machines you can allow for the
redundancy and failover that was
previously possible only with the
purchase of additional hardware and
there are many other possible
applications these are just a few now
let's look at the similarities and
differences between servers and virtual
machines both servers and virtual
machines run operating systems and
applications serve up websites and
respond to pings and they can be
networked in contrast to servers virtual
machines don't have a one-to-one
relationship to Hardware you can run
several virtual machines on a single
piece of equipment they allow you to add
hard drive space or memory much more
easily
you don't have to buy a new server when
you run out of space they boot faster
and are easier to move they require more
processing power and memory this is
especially true for hosted virtual
machines they're easier to troubleshoot
and they have different requirements for
security</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
