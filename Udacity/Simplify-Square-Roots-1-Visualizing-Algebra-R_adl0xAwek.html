root of two can't be simplified some
other square roots can so let's figure
out if we can simplify roots and how to
do that we'll start with this one we're
going to use the product rule to help us
simplify this radical the product rule
allows us to break up a radical into the
multiplication of two separate radicals
so if we have two factors multiplied
together underneath the radical we can
take the square root of each of them and
multiply that result together for
example for the square root of a hundred
we know this is really just 10 but we
can find this answer another way we know
100 is the same thing as 4 times 25 so
we can break up this radical and take
the square root of each of the factors
the square root of 4 is 2 and the square
root of 25 is 5 which leaves us with two
times five which is 10 our original
answer these were perfect squares so we
were able to take out a factor in each
case the two and the five you'll notice
that 75 is not a perfect square but
there is a perfect square as one of its
factors use the product rule to break
this up from the two radicals and then
take the square root of one of them
leave any numbers that are not perfect
squares underneath the radical when
you're ready write your answer here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
