longer leg is 21 meters and the
hypotenuse is 29 meters great work if
you found all three now the setup might
have been tough so if you got stuck
there watch part of the solution and
then pause it and see if you can
continue solving to start setting up
this problem will let X be the shortest
side of our right triangle we do this
since we know the longer leg of the
right triangle is 1 meter more than the
shorter leg so we know this longer leg
has to be X plus 1 and now here's we
want to be careful we know the
hypotenuse is 8 meters longer than the
longer leg so we'll take the length of
the longer leg X plus 1 and we'll add on
8 meters so the entire length of our
hypotenuse is X plus 1 plus 8 or just X
plus 9 now we have expressions for each
side of a right triangle and we can use
the Pythagorean theorem to solve we
square X which is one of the legs and X
plus 1 the other leg this gives us these
two expressions and then we square the I
potenuse X plus nine to get this
expression on the right hand side of our
equation we combine the like terms here
to get 2x squared and the rest of our
equation remains the same next we
subtract each of these terms from both
sides of the equation so we have 0 on
the right and x squared minus 16x minus
80 on the left next we factor this
expression to get X minus 20 times X
plus 4 equals 0 we set each factor equal
to 0 which means the solutions for X
could be positive 20 or negative for the
opposite sign of the factors in the
parentheses we know a negative side
lengths for X wouldn't make sense in
this case because we would have negative
4 here so this solution is not valid we
plug in 24 X in each of these
expressions we'll get our side lengths
of 20 21 and 29 with the hypotenuse
being the longest one of 29 units and
since our original side links were
reported in meters we report each of
these and meters</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
