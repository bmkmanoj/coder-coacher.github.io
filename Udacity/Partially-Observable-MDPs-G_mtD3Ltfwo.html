hey Michael thank you for welcoming to
the next lesson what is the next lesson
so I don't know can you read it I can
read some of I can't quite see all of it
haha I get it so the topic is partially
observable MDPs but I made the MVPs
partially observable brilliant kind of
fell off the bottom of the screen so
yeah so this is the idea of talking
about Markov decision processes like
we've been talking about but ones where
the agent has to make decisions based on
what it can see of the Markov decision
process not necessarily the true and
current state yeah we talked a little
bit about this in the old machine
learning class did me but just a little
ok all right well so then we're gonna
get a little bit more into it maybe I
don't know what what do we talk about
last time I don't know I don't remember
just that there was we mentioned I think
we mentioned that they exist ok well so
we're going to talk about how they work</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
