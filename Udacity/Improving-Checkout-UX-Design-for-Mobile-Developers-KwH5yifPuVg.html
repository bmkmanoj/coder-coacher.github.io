sign-in flow now we're going to talk
about a second concrete improvement of
how to make the UX of your app better
and that is with the checkout form so if
you have an application and it involves
your users buying something from you
then this step is really important yeah
and this is actually a point where 70%
off users on average on the internet
drop off meaning that there's 70%
abandonment rate of shopping carts
across the web that's a huge number that
means like 3 out of 10 people are
actually making it through this form
when they see this form the first
reaction that people have is they run
away so so how do you actually make this
form better since it's such a critical
part of you actually getting paid we
need to make it easier for you yeah
exactly so how would you improve this
form so would you add more steps for
example instead of having a single page
with all this information about billing
information shipping information and
credit card information would you break
it onto multiple steps or would you
improve the visual layout of this form
would you add more space saying bigger
fonts and make it so that people can
more easily type information if this
thing or my favorite would you actually
add more text boxes to this form because
you know that's the one thing that
people have to do is fill out more
information on tiny tiny mobile screens
or would you rather just replace this
form entirely with a pre count solution
like checkout with Google or with PayPal
or Amazon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
