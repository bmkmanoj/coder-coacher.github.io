important points to note 1 write down
all of your work as you do it to write
down and label all the values every
intermediate step you're going to need
the values throughout the example and
throughout round every answer to two
decimal places even when you're working
through a problem if we were doing these
problems for real in other words we
these were actual data from an actual
research study we wouldn't run into two
decimal places throughout because that
adds in rounding error but just for the
sake of you understanding how to work
these problems and interpret them two
decimal places is fine here's sort of
our problem according to the Gallup
Organization us families reported
spending an average of 151 dollars per
week on food in 2012 now although this
data came from a sample we're going to
pretend that this perfectly represents
the whole population so we're going to
assume that this is mu make sure you
write that down mu equals 151 now
imagine that there's a food cooperative
will call them food now and they want to
reduce the cost of food for their
members to do so they implement some
cost saving programs this could include
things like buying from local growers
and so on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
