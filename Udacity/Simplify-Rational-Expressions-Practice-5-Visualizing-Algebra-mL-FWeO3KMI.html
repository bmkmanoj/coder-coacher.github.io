difference of two squares we can write
it as six minus x x 6 plus X for this
denominator we want to find the factors
of negative 48 that sum to positive 2
these factors are negative 6 and
positive 8 when I look at my factors it
doesn't seem as if anything can simplify
out to equal one but if I look at these
two factors I can see that these are
opposite polynomials the constant term 6
is positive while this one's negative
and the X term is negative here while
the sex term is positive this means i'll
have a factor of negative 1 we can see
this if we were to just switch the order
of the terms for these two will have
negative 6 plus X then I could factor a
negative 1 from this factor i'll have
negative 1 times positive 6 minus x i
change the signs of both of these terms
since i factored a negative 1 out these
factors of 6 minus x simplify to 1 but i
still have a negative one out in front
just like i thought here whenever you
see opposite polynomial factors you can
simplify them to be negative 1 we don't
need to show all this work so we're left
with this expression now I want to
acknowledge there are a lot of different
answers here this negative sign could
have been distributed to either the
numerator or the denominator if we
distribute the negative 1 to the
numerator we could have gotten this
expression or switch the order of these
terms and gotten this expression these
are all equal if we distribute this
negative 1 instead the denominator we
could wind up with any of these
expressions and in fact all of these are
correct in general it's easiest to list
the negative sign out in front of a
fraction and then write your rational
expressions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
