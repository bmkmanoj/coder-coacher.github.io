down here at the bottom one of the first
things we print out is fun 1 X is Hong
Kong the only Hong Kong we ever see in
the program is the first argument to fun
one so that means that this must be X
fun one why is outside why which means
that we can't have overwritten it here
if we put Y in this box we would
mistakenly get out 1997 and we don't see
that so it can't be X because we just
use X can't be why so let's try Z if we
pass in 1997 is Z then why we'll still
refer to this old value of outside why
we'll get the printout that we expect
then we call fun too and down here if we
take a look at the printout X remains
unchanged X is still outside X but why
is fun 1y place we see that is right
here it's the parameter being passed in
so in order from fun 1y to flow here we
have to fill in this box with why note
that the way scoping works fun one and
fun 2 are independent so even though fun
one has overwritten X fun too still sees
the old outside value well let's test
this answer and see if it's right I will
just add a little more information and
huzzah we get exactly the output we were
expecting some actual information that
Hong Kong is a special administrative
region in China which controlled by the
UK until 1997 and then down here just
the output we had hoped to get for this
puzzle</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
