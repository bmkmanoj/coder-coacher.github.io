values GNC can have you may have picked
several of these choices but it is okay
you know whatever you picked it's okay
let's talk through these different
choices to see what are possible given
this set of instructions and the fact
that processes P 1 and P 2 are executing
independently on two different
processors and we have no way of knowing
what is going on with the shared memory
now the first possibility is that these
two instructions assignment of B to D
and C do a they happen in time order
before any of these instructions
executed that's possible because if
these shared memory accesses happen
before these guys then it is possible
that both of these instructions are
executed before any of these
instructions executed and in that case
what you will get into D and C are the
old values of a and B namely zero the
second possibility is that the both
these instructions that is executed on P
to get executed after both the
instructions on P one have completed
execution so in this case both a has
gotten a new value B has gotten a new
value and so when we go here and make
the assignments then both D and C are
going to have the new values that are in
B and E respectively and so this is a
possibility right there is a possibility
that both C and D have a value one in
them let's see if the third possibility
can happen the third possibility for it
to happen it is conceivable that we
insert these two instructions in the
middle of this or in other words process
p1 executed this instruction and and in
time order it so happens that these two
instructions got executed and then this
this instruction got executed and
therefore what you get into D is the old
value of B that is 0 and what you get
into C is the old value of a I'm sorry
the new value of a because this
instruction is executed and therefore
you get
one end to see and that's why this
possibility is also is also perfectly
valid now let's look at this last choice
that I have see gets 0 and D gets 1 can
this happen see getting a 0 and D
getting a 1 and the reason I ask you
this question is because if you look at
this piece of code and this piece of
code here if you were to get one what
that means is that this assignment of B
gets B plus 1 has already happened on p1
that's how the new value of B has gotten
into D but yet we are saying when this
process completes C has a value of 0
what does that mean means that the new
value of a hasn't come into the process
of p2 how can this happen it can happen
if messages go out of order you have to
remember that if you recall the picture
of the shared memory machine you've got
you've got an interconnection network
that is connecting all these processors
and a write that happens on this
processor has to go through the
interconnection network and get to this
other processor now it is conceivable
that if messages go out of order it is
possible that when this process executes
this statement this new value of B has
arrived
the message that contains a new value of
B has arrived and therefore this
assignment gets a new value of of B but
when the process executes the statement
the new value of a hasn't arrived yet
and it can happen if the messages go out
of order and in that case you can end up
with this particular choice of C having
a value of 0 and D having a value of 1
when this process completes execution
you want it to happen now intuitively
you would see that this is not something
that you expect to happen as a
programmer you don't want surprises
right and if you don't want surprises
perhaps if there's a non-intuitive
result that's something that should not
be allowed by the model so when we talk
about memory consistency model we are
saying what is the contract between the
program
and the system and and what we are
saying through this example is that this
particular outcome is counterintuitive
and therefore the model should not allow
this particular outcome to be possible
in the execution and this is the reason
why you have memory consistency model</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
