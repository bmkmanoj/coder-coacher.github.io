scientists believe that P does not equal
NP and there are basically two reasons
for that the first reason is the power
of non-determinism the power of guessing
correctly it kind of seems strange that
that should be possible always in
polynomial time and the second reason
and unfortunately we'll only briefly
touch that in this course is that there
are problems that are believed to be
even much harder than NP complete
problems and P equals NP would imply
that also these much harder problems
would be solvable in polynomial time the
high chances that P does not equal NP is
of course what makes resolving the P
versus NP question much harder because
if we wanted to show that P equals NP
then all we would have to find is one
single polynomial time algorithm for an
np-complete problem but if we want to
show that P does not equal NP then we'll
have to construct some mathematical
proof that takes into account any
conceivable algorithm no matter how
sophisticated or thought through or
advanced as long as that algorithm runs
in polynomial time we must show that it
cannot solve an np-complete problem now
as famous as the P versus NP question is
there's some heated debate on whether
that would actually have any practical
consequences on the theoretical level of
course it would be a fantastic result
and the person who manages to resolve p
versus NP would become quite famous but
on a practical level there's two things
to consider one is that polynomial time
doesn't always mean efficiency so as
you've seen with the NP completeness
proof of sad the polynomials involves
quickly get very large and of course a
polynomial time algorithm with a time of
say n to the power of 20 would not
really be practical and on the other
hand because NP complete problems are so
important in practice there's lots of
techniques that have been developed to
actually deal with them and we'll learn
some of them in this course of course in
any case if you want to spark a heated
debate between theoretical computer
scientists should you ever have the
opportunity to do so then just ask them
whether resolving P versus NP would have
any practical consequences</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
