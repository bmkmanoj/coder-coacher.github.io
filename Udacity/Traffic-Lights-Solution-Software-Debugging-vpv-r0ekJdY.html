answer let us discuss the options one by
one first print this can't happen cool
it's going to go to the console probably
going to go to some to some log but it's
unlikely that anyone would ever notice
this and this means that our traffic
light well in our simulation will be in
some undefined state possibly meaning
that the traffic will also be in some
undefined state what happens if you have
multiple traffic lights and one of them
is neither read nor yellow no green oh
this is going to going to cause lots and
lots of interesting issues so simply
printing this out to the console is not
enough this problem is too hard we are
right we are violating a data invariant
here which also rules out the last
option there's not a good option now for
the two remaining choices and this is a
tough choice we could have the assertion
in here assert fault which would be nice
but keep in mind that this could
actually also be turned off for instance
when invoking the Python interpreter
with minus 0 however in this particular
situation there is no reason to turn as
this assertion off because well if it
gets executed then it raises an
exception immediately and if it does not
get executed then everything is fine
meaning that by turning it off we don't
get any savings so the better option is
simply to raise an assertion exception
plain and simple and thereby to document
that something is going really wrong in
the program this will not hurt
performance at all obviously because it
will only be triggered when all other
checks already have failed however if
this were a production program you may
wish to come up with some global
try-catch block in the program or in
Python this would be at global try
except block that would catch all
assertion exceptions and then pop up a
dialog saying oh we encountered a fatal
error possible offering some recovery
mechanism or some ability to save the
progress that we've seen so far such
that are the user is not confronted
simply with all of it all of his work
