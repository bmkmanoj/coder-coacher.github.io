at Google for the last five years and I
do client work you I work on the Play
Store anything awesome and what do you
like about it uh well I always like
writing code and seeing pixels light up
on the screen so this is the player
Google Play app starting from my top to
bottom we have the search box then we
have this and what we call Quick Links
to go to various subsections of the app
and then of the store and then we have a
different content here so we have a
clusters of cards we have this we call a
banner that gets you into some other
place in the app you can go into the
details page of a certain item let's say
Angry Birds Stella pop and this is a
what we're showing here kind of the mix
of information that developer has
provided we have the video of the app
then we have the short description of
the app screenshots then we have the
user provided content reviews and
ratings of that app little bit more
related content and then here are a
couple of links and you can go and also
from the details page you can start the
install process this is the permissions
and then you go and accept them and it
starts and you can see over here it
starts installing it
so the students have been learning about
text views image views buttons can you
point out a couple of those in the app
yeah so back to the cards if we look at
this Star Wars rebels so the card itself
is an extension of a view group but it
can be as simple as an extension of a
relative layout and then we have this
thumbnail is an image view then we have
this Star Wars rebel is a text view that
goes to maximum of two lines rating bar
is well rating bar the free is a text
view and the overflow dots is an image
view with a source set to a certain PNG
that looks like three dots and then the
same for the Quick Links so it is it is
a relative layout with the image view on
the left and then the textview in single
line mode going to right of that image
view and extending however much it needs
and it has its background set and we
serve enjoyable that has a green
background with rounded corners so
essentially as you say it boils down to
taking these very basic building blocks
text views image views are sometimes
rating bar progress bar spinner check
box radio button and combining them
based on what your design shows on a
particular screen yeah that's so cool
because these students are learning this
in the very first lesson of Android and
you're using this every day in the
Google Play app
you mentioned working with a designer so
can you describe what that process is
like so it starts from the product
people and then it goes into discussions
with a design and engineering on what
are the screens that we are talking
about and how hopefully already at that
point on the design side we start
thinking about how it adapts to smaller
screens to larger screens and after that
we do this kind of iterations on putting
something on the screen and start
validating the overall approach because
sometimes you have a static mock or
maybe a motion mock from like you know
After Effects or whatever to of the
designers are using and you see it on on
your desktop screen and then you put it
on the phone and it feels quite
different because you have a smaller
screen or because it's a touch
interaction or maybe because you know
you are depending on all these great big
images but the network is slow and so
you start with this screen that five
seconds doesn't display anything and so
hopefully throughout this iterative
process where we put something on the
screen not necessarily pixel perfect
then we can go back into the product
level discussions and see okay what do
we need to you a tweak
so for developers who don't have a
designer to work with do you have
suggestions on what they can do to make
their app better I would suggest going
to the website for material design and
get acquainted not necessarily like you
know with the finer parts of like you
know motion arcs or all those
interpolators but focus on the bigger
picture so to have consistent grid
across the entire app what we call key
lines or what the design calls key lines
vertical and horizontal where elements
align to certain visual rhythm and they
don't feel just randomly thrown onto the
screen and so you have your toolbar you
have maybe your maybe like other parts
of your chrome like the navigation
elements in your screen and then you
have the content itself so it's great
when it all aligns to the same grid and
you have a little bit of margins on the
sides and you know things are not too
close to each other then you have our
typography which is a is a great way to
visually convey the relative importance
of different things so if you talk about
something like inbox or like Gmail or
like a an email app so if everything has
the same type of graphical language if
everything is the same color the same
size and the same style then it's not
really easy to scan it so maybe you
would want there to make the center a
little bit bigger like the sender name
or maybe the title or like the first few
words of the subject to be bold and that
would allow the user to more quickly
scan depends once again on on your
content but then I wouldn't recommend
necessarily going with a too many style
so too many sizes three four styles are
used consistently across multiple
screens a lot of the user to kind of get
even on a subconscious level to get kind
of
sure of how to how to get things done in
your app and not necessarily fight to
understand where the information is that
he or she is looking for and the last
thing colors use a little bit of
especially with material it kind of
leans toward using big splashes of
saturated colors which looks great
especially if it goes into the status
bar on lollipop devices identify maybe
like you know what we call them accent
colors and primary colors identify a
couple colors and use them to kind of
like you know to style the chrome of
your app so like status bar action bar
maybe a little bit in the drawer in the
navigation drawer and using highlights
or accents for the floating action
button or maybe for like you know to
draw attention to a certain like very
important element what you consider an
important element and I think these
three go a long way towards like you
know emphasizing a little bit more like
you know the visual style of the app and
of course if you have an opportunity to
team up with the designer that's always
great</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
