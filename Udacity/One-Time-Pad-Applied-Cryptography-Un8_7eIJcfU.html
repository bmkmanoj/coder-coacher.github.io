precisely so we're going to find our set
of messages is strings of zeros and ones
so we'll use bits and of some fixed
length so n is number that gives us the
maximum length of a message our message
is selected from all bondage things of
length n our key is also selected from
the set of all binary strings of length
n and then to do encryption our
encryption function we're going to think
of the message as being the sequence of
bits and the key is also a sequence of
bits the result of our encryption is the
cipher text which is a sequence of bits
also length n where the value of each
ciphertext bit is equal to the XOR of
the corresponding message bit and the
corresponding keep it so let's try an
example and for this example I'm going
to give you the ciphertext and the key
and the message so suppose our message
is the string CS but our message space
is in bits well the first thing we need
to do is to convert those strings to
bits and we can do that in Python by
using Ord that takes a one character
string and turns it into a decimal
number and then we need to convert that
decimal number into bits into a binary
number and we need to do this for each
character in the string we're going to
convert it to a character convert that
to bits and I'll show you the code for
doing that
we'll leave the more interesting code
for you to write here we're converting
to bits this is a fairly straightforward
but not the shortest way to do this
we're going to make an array of bits as
our result for any decimal number if
it's divisible by two we want to have a
0 at the beginning of a result if it's
not divisible by 2 that's going to be a
1 and then we divide the number by 2 as
we go forward so that's going to fill up
all the places we want our bits to be
particularly so we have a padding and
for all the characters we'll use 7 bits
so we're going to pad the result with
leading zeros until we get to that size
we could see this so if we do Ord we see
that the number corresponding to the
letter C is 67 if we convert that to
bits and we use 7 as our
that gives us enough for 128 different
values which is enough for the ASCII
character values that we get back from
word we can see those bits as a list and
we can see that a little more easily as
a string using the display bits
procedure that just turns that into a
string so now we want to convert more
than one character to do that we have a
string to bits procedure that goes
through all the characters in the string
converting each one to bits using
convert to bits and concatenate those
all together to the result so now we can
do string to bits for our two letter
string and now we get fourteen bits as a
result so if that's our message then the
value of M is what we got there so this
is our message there 14 bits and is 14
that means to encrypt this using a
one-time pad we need a key that also has
14 bits so let's take our key and we're
just going to make up a random key now
actually finding random values is very
important in cryptography and we'll talk
about that in a later unit but for now
let's just make one up so suppose this
is our key then the ciphertext is just
the result of XOR in each message bit
with the score corresponding key bit so
that's our ciphertext so the question is
as an interceptor you saw just this
ciphertext you don't know anything about
the message or the key and you're going
to guess possible key values to try to
figure out what the message is and what
key value would you guess that would
mislead you to think that the message
was actually BS instead of CS</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
