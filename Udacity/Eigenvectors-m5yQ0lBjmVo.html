eigenvectors are there not on the planet
in general okay
okay well normally for a real symmetric
and by the way these things are
typically symmetric because if you take
a look here right I've got this sum of
the squares but on the off diagonal
terms I've got the same values the sum
of the cost terms right so if I have a
real symmetric matrix in general if it's
size n by n I normally would have in
real eigen vectors and distinct eigen
vectors there are some degeneracies if
you have identical eigenvalues and then
you have a ambiguity we're not gonna
worry about that too much but just
remember that normally and the reason I
say normally is later it's gonna be a
little different
normally with an N by n matrix I'm gonna
have n eigenvectors so graphically we
can look at that like this so here I
have a beautiful set of points aren't
those delightful distributed in two
dimensions and which way do you think is
the principal eigenvector well probably
something along like that right that's
going to be the axis of least inertia
right or of greatest variance get used
to this idea that its greatest variance
and in fact that's what this nice little
picture shows us and this is showing us
lambda 1 meaning the first eigenvalue
Laura dragon value and what direction is
the next eigenvector well as you know
it's perpendicular to that right because
eigen vectors are perpendicular to each
other and go and the next one is the
next most variance etc with two
dimensions it's hard to show there's
only two here why am I telling you all
