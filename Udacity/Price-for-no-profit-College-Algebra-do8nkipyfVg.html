there's no X in our equation instead
we're solving for see since C stands for
the price per wiper set we want to know
what values of C will make p equals 0
now this is in the general form for a
quadratic equation that means we can use
the quadratic formula this may be a
little bit confusing because our
variable is called C and we would
usually refer to this constant term at
the end as see what's really important
though is what we call these constants
rather it's where we place them in the
quadratic formula once we have this all
right now we just need to simplify and
solve simplifying gives us these numbers
C equals negative eighteen thousand four
hundred plus or minus the square root of
232 million all over negative 400 this
is one of those moments where I'm very
grateful for calculators as much as I
really do think it's important for
people to be able to manipulate numbers
on their own but I can't figure out the
square root of 232 million in my head
because of the plus or minus this is
going to split into two answers for see
now we can simplify what's under the
square root and also divide both terms
in the numerators by negative 400 so we
get 40 6-5 route 58 and 46 plus 5 square
root 58 let's look at that decimal
approximations of each of these the
first one is about equal to 7.92 and the
second is about equal to 80 four point
oh eight so these are our two solutions
let's check out the graph for a second
so here's the graph of our equation for
grants profit p equals negative 200 c
squared plus 18,400 c minus 130 3200
this is this lovely curve we've seen
several times now please note of course
the scale and either access these bolder
vertical lines each mark 20 units or
twenty dollars and these bolt horizontal
lines each mark $50,000 so let's look at
our x-intercepts and yes this one does
look like it's just before 10 so seven
dollars 90 two cents makes sense or 7.92
for this point this one is just past 80
so eighty-four dollars and eight cents
makes sense as well so let's keep in
mind what we're actually doing in
problems like this when we start with an
equation for a parabola I
this one if we want to find the location
of its x-intercepts we can set the
vertical coordinate equal to zero since
that's what's true at the x axis or the
horizontal axis the c-axis in the case
of this problem and then when we set
that vertical coordinate equal to zero
we can use the quadratic formula to
solve provided that the rest of the
equation is in the proper form the
quadratic formula gives us the
horizontal coordinates of those points
that have a vertical coordinate of 0 in
other words it gives us the x
coordinates of the x-intercepts or in
this case the sea coordinates of the sea
