engine working for the rest of the unit
we're going to learn more about how we
actually get web pages on the Internet
so far we've been using the magic get
page function and we provided this
function that takes as its input a URL
which is a resource locator on the web
and it produces as output the contents
of that page I can show you the Python
code that we use forget page it won't
really help very much in terms of
understanding what's going on on the
internet but I don't want you to think
there's anything hidden here
so the main thing that we're doing and
get page is we're returning the result
of calling URL open passing in the URL
so that opens the web page that was
requested and then reading that page and
that returns the output of that page as
a string this is provided by the Python
library URL libs so we needed to import
that library and so that's what's going
on the rest of this is an exception
handler so we call this a try block that
we're gonna try these things they might
not always work and this is where we use
try there might be an error
maybe the URL is bad maybe we don't
actually get a page back maybe the
internet request times out doesn't
always work even if it's in a do RL so
that's why you put this inside a try
block and if something fails execution
will jump to the except block this is
called the exception Handler and in this
case we just return an empty string so
that means if we request a URL that
can't be loaded instead of getting an
error it will just return an empty
string and for the use in our web
crawler this is a good thing if we
didn't do this then the web crawler
would have to deal with a case where the
page doesn't exist in our case we just
get an empty string so there's no
content on that page so looking at the
actual code forget page doesn't really
help us understand much about what's
going on when we request a web page all
the actual work is hidden in this Python
library function so to understand more
about what's going on we need to
understand more about how the internet
works</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
