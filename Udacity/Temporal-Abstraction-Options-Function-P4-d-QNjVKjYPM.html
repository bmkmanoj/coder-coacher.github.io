our is an expectation over the set of
rewards that you're going to see after K
steps i'm going to write f in the same
way and I've sort of got some really
funky notation here but let me try to
explain it in English f is simply the
expectation of me ending up in s prime
after K steps so this Delta is because I
can't draw a lowercase Delta as well
this uh this is a delta function it is
one in the case where the kate state
that i see is actually equal to s prime
and zero otherwise and delta to the k is
just well the discount factor raised to
the cave power so f is an expectation
over after I've executed the option that
I will end up in state X prime having
started in state s and having taken K
steps now notice why do I even have to
go through all this why can I just put t
of s comma 0 comma s prime here well
first off T is defined in terms of a
it's not defined in terms of oh but
that's okay the reason I have to do this
little funky thing and what we call it f
instead of T is because as you point out
in the beginning there needs to be a
discount factor attached to the value of
this the next state which in this case
is s Prime so what we've done is we've
rolled up that discount factor inside of
F so f is the expectation of me starting
an s taking option Oh ending up in s
prime after K steps and the Delta sub K
gets sort of brought along with that
expectation so that I can appropriately
discount the s prime state that I will
end up in hmm okay right so in the end
both are in averages expectations there
exactly doing what they were doing in
the original bellman operator bellman
equation that we're using before in the
original bellman equation the reward was
just the immediate reward that we got
for taking an action here the reward is
just an expectation over all the rewards
that we're going to see given that we've
taken this particular option if the
option is in fact a single action then
it would be exactly the same thing as a
reward we would get for being in that
state and taking that action similarly F
is just the transition function except
now it's sort of the accumulation of all
the transitions of starting at s and
ending up in s prime after K steps
then I took the particular actions that
are inside of the option and defined by
PI now there's a couple neat facts about
this or I will I will write them down on
the next slide but I just want to point
out what's particularly cool about this
is that it really is a bellman equation
it really does allow us to do all of the
things that the bellman equation Delta
operator allowed us to do in MVPs but it
allows us to analyze or to reason about
or to plan over this multiple variable
time mdp so in fact this kind of MVP has
a name which I probably should have
written down earlier and it's called
SMTP where the S stands for what do you
think Michael something yes and that
something is semi so this is called a
semi Markov decision process and the
difference between the markov decision
process and the semi markov decision
process is you get to make these jumps
in time and because we have this bellman
operator that takes into account all the
possible jumps in time that you might
take in the end it grounds out to an
underlying MTP and allows us to inherit
all the things that bellman allowed us
to inherit</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
