already and that is prior to p2 getting
its lock it is possible that maybe
another processor say p3 also use the
same lock and so when it executed it's
critical section may be in its critical
section it modified the page X again and
it created its own diff let's call it XD
prime because all of these locks are the
same when the DSM software knows that
now there are two diff associated with
this lock l1 diff is with the processor
p1 and another diff is residing with
processor p3 and therefore when
processor P two tries to access X the
DSM software has not only to get the dip
from p1 but it also needs to get the dip
from p2 and apply it to the original
pristine version of the page that is
with the owner of the page so that it
can create the current version of the
page and you can extend this to any
number of processors that may have made
modifications their own modifications to
this page under the provision of this
lock l all of those disks are going to
be applied in order for the processor p2
to access the page as the current page
if after accessing the page X in its
execution p2 touches let's say page z at
that point once again the DSM software
knows that oh I know that Z was modified
by the previous lock holder ZD is a diff
I know where to find it I'll bring the
original copy of Z from the owner of Z
and apply the diffs to it before letting
p to access Z so you can see that even
though the invalidation was done right
at the beginning we are procrastinating
getting the diffs till the point of
access so this is what lrc allows you to
do is just bring in what this guy needs
so for instance inside this critical
section maybe only X is accessed y and z
are not
accessed at all in which case we never
bring the dips from p1 to p2 for y and z
on the other hand it is possible that p2
as part of its execution of its critical
section modifies another page q
different from x y and z so now the DSM
software knows that this particular lock
is associated not just with XY and Z but
it is also associated with Q so future
lock request for L will result in
invalidating XYZ and Q because all of
those may have been modified and the
next critical section that wants to
access this lock l has to get the
current versions of all the pages that
were ever associated with l</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
