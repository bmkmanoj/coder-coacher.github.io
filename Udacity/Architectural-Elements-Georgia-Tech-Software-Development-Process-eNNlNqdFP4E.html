foundational aspects of software
architectures and we have looked at some
real-world examples that help us to
illustrate some of these points to
discuss some of these aspects I want to
introduce and define the different
elements the composer software
architecture and also talk about
architectural styles so let's start by
discussing as software architectures
elements a software systems architecture
typically is not and should not be a
uniform monolith on the contrary an
architecture should be a composition and
interplay of different elements in
particular as we quickly mention at the
beginning of the lesson there are three
main types of elements in an
architecture processing elements data
elements and interaction elements
processing elements are those elements
that implement the business logic and
perform transformations on data data
elements also called information or
state are those elements that contain
the information that is used and
transformed by the processing elements
and finally the interaction elements are
the glue that holds the different pieces
of the architecture together now the
processing elements and the data are
contained in to the system components
whereas the interaction elements are
maintained and controlled by the system
connectors and components and connectors
get all cooked together into a systems
configuration which models components
connectors and their relationships so
now let's look at components connectors
and configurations in a little more
detail</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
