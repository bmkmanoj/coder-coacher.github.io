courses is programming exercises here's
a simple programming exercise from AI
for robotics in these exercises you'll
have an IDE available right in the web
browser you'll be given some initial
code to work from like we see here
so after you've worked on the exercise
you can click test friend at the bottom
the output of your code will be
displayed below then when you're
satisfied with your code you can click
Submit on the right and you will see
your evaluation on the right we have
some courses that actually use this code
window for project submission you'll
develop the project on your local
machine but you can use this window to
test and make sure that your code
actually runs and maybe see some
preliminary output for those courses
when the TAS go to grade your project
they'll pull the last thing that you
submitted before the due date so make
sure your last submission is the one you
want to turn in but you don't need to
worry about that too much right now that
will be explained in more detail when
you get to those actual classes now over
here on the right you've probably
noticed that every screen suggests that
you take up this conversation on Piazza
Piazza is the forum tool that we use
right now in the OMS program so let's
talk about that next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
