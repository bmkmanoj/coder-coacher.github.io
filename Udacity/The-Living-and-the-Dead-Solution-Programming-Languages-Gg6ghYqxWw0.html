dead code that is code that could not
have any effect on the final return
result of the method we're interested in
so let's go ahead and just dive right in
this we take a fragment when if you
remember the fragments are of this shape
where the first part of the tuple is the
variable to be assigned to and then the
next part of the tuple is the expression
that is being assigned to it in this
case one is being assigned a or a
operation one is being assigned to be to
as being assigned to see etc now we're
not really concerned with what
specifically the operations are we don't
care what operations are being done we
just care that something is being done
to these variables is if there is
something being done even if it ends up
setting them to the exact same thing we
can't necessarily know that ahead of
time so if you have a fragment of this
shape then we store that as the old
fragment has the unoptimized fragment
and that's the first first argument to
this method and the return is the end
return value is the list of variables
returned at the end of the fragment and
if they're returned to the end of the
fragment they're automatically live as
we said up here now we want to create a
new optimized fragment of just the live
variables so we start off by initially
initializing that to an empty list and
we set a variable called live equal to
the returned live variables because we
know those are live now for every
statement in the fragment starting from
the back so we're working backwards from
the return statement back up to the top
we check if the first first element of
the tuple statement that is the
left-hand side of the statement is
already in live that is it is one of the
live variables currently if it is then
we add that statement to the new
optimized fact
otherwise we fall through and now we
take the list of live variables and we
remove the variables that we are now
assigning to so we take all those out
from there we update the live list with
all the variables that are currently on
the right hand side of statement we run
through the entire fragment doing that
over and over until we get back to the
top once we're done with that we check
if the new fragment is equal to the old
fragment it is then we return the new
fragment we didn't change anything so we
just returned and stopped and we're done
if it isn't well then we might have
further optimizations as we discussed
earlier then we return removing dead of
the new fragment in return so we
recursively call this until we don't get
any further changes because hopefully we
can optimize further now we're going to
check that remove dead gives us what we
would expect if we ran through all the
optimizations by hand and I'm not going
to bother going through all of these you
can read them fairly easily and when we
do that we see that we get true values
for each of these this is a fairly
involved a little bit of code takes a
little bit to think about and this is a
very useful optimization because we can
potentially get rid of a lot of code
doing this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
