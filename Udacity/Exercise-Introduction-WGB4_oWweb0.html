and exercise imagine you had to prepare
an analysis model of the external
behavior of this clock radio using state
charts what steps would you take to do
this because we are concerned here with
modeling behavior one natural wait to
get started is with usage scenarios also
called use cases a use case is a
sequence of steps each involving an
actor performing action possibly on an
object clearly any model of behavior of
the clock radio must indicate how each
of the use cases is realize see if you
can come up with three typical use cases
for the clock radio okay so the first
use case I can think of is that the user
is setting the time for one of the three
different modes so whether that's the
display time or the time we want the
alarm to go off and can't there's a
third time but each of those I guess is
a separate use case but we'll just say
setting the time is use case one okay so
jared is right that each one of those
would be a separate use case and now
we're picking the one about just setting
the time of day that's visible on the
display and then for use case number two
we could change the frequency of the
radio so we may be in a.m mode and
changing the frequency or an FM mode and
change in frequency so regardless of the
mode we're changing what station is
coming in right so we're going to be
twisting that that knob to change it's
on our side on the side okay and then
for a third use case let's say the user
presses the snooze button the alarms
going off and they won't sleep a little
bit longer okay clearly there are lots
of other ones like just listening to the
radio turning it on and just listening
to it or getting shocked out of bed by
the beeper going off lots of
possibilities here and ultimately our
state chart model needs to be able to
cover all the all the cases that might
might arise including including error
cases including situations where what
you had hoped to happen doesn't happen
and the radio has to respond in that
situation</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
