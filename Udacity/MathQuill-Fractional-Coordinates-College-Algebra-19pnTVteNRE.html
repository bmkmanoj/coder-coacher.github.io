may need to enter coordinate pairs using
of course typical coordinate notation
with parentheses around the outside of
them that contain fractions for the
coordinate values this is actually a
little bit tricky to do in math quill so
we're going to talk about how you do
this I'm going to tell you exactly how
to type this out so let's say that we
wanted to type so let's say that this is
the ordered pair that we want to type 3
/ 4 comma negative one and a half I'm
going to tell you exactly what keys to
press and then what will appear as you
type each one of them so the first thing
we have is is open parentheses when you
type that both parentheses appear the
next step is to type of forward slash
which point the space inside the tube
parentheses will turn into the input for
a fraction so there will be a line in a
space for you to enter the numerator in
the denominator your cursor at this
point will be in the numerator and as
unintuitive it might seem what we want
to do is to get the cursor to be right
here inside the first parentheses but
before we have the option to type inside
the fraction so you just need to type a
left arrow key to move the cursor over
here then you can type a comma which
will be the comma between our two
coordinates at this point your cursor
will be right here between the comma in
the fraction spot seem to type the left
arrow key to move it back here then we
just need to create the first coordinate
then need to type a forward slash again
which will create another spot for a
fraction to be input and then you can
use the arrow keys as you normally would
between fractions to go to each
numerator denominator and edge of the
values that you want to so you can see
that what's happening here in terms of
the order that things appeared in over
here depending on what I told you to
type that you have to actually create
the spot for the second coordinate as a
fraction before you create the first one
if you try to create one fraction and
then put a comma it's not going to work
another option would be for you to
create two separate fraction spots and
then move to the spot between the two of
them and then put a comma this is just a
way that works really easily for me but
of course as always you can experiment
and figure out what works best for you
so thinking about how you create two
coordinates that are each fractions I'd
like you to try out typing each of these
coordinate pairs first one we have is
three-fourths common negative one half
then we have 1 comma 2 / 7 and then we
have negative 1 8th comma 3 so just play
about these and see even get comfortable
with this format</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
