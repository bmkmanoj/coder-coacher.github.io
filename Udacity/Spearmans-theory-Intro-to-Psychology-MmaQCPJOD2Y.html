address the question how intelligent are
you and the evidence for this theory is
fairly strong Spearman found that the
correlations across the three domains
we're about positive point six and point
seven now this is on a correlation scale
between negative one and positive one
and because it's positive the two scores
will go in the same direction so as one
score increases so does the other score
still to this day modern tests of
intelligence show that the three primary
domains of intelligence are positively
correlated supporting the view that
intelligence is one general ability now
it's important to remember that theories
drive scientific research a theory
doesn't necessarily mean it's a law
regardless of how strong the
correlations are theories can change and
be adapted over time the theory that
intelligence is one basic set of related
skills is known as the G factor theory
of intelligence this is the foundation
for the idea that intelligence can be
represented by a single number
this theory organizes intelligence into
a hierarchy with general intelligence or
G at the top and from there extends
three specific domains your spatial
abilities your mathematical abilities
and your verbal abilities until recently
all of the major tests of intelligence
have been based on Spearman's theory</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
