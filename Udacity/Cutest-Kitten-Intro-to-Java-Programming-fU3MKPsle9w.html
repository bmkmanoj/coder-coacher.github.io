write the tester there are multiple ways
you could do this but there are also a
lot of ways that look similar and don't
work here's the way I came up with first
it checks to see if the kitten is more
than six months if so we know that we
want to return cute
now if the kitten is not more than six
months but is two or more months then
the kitten is super cute this condition
is only checked if this condition
already failed this whole piece of code
is under the else clause for the first
if now if both of these conditions are
false then we end up in the last else
clause this catches everything that
doesn't satisfy one of the first two
conditions so if the kittens not older
than six months and is not two months or
older then it's younger than two months
and so it's not cute yet
let's check that this works okay it
looks like these match they match match
match and match so we're good we could
change this code slightly by adding
another condition here the code will
still work modified this way but it's
considered bad form if you decide to
modify the two months threshold you now
have to change it in two places instead
of just one also if you don't understand
the condition right or just make a
little error there could be cases that
you miss and don't handle at all so
don't add an if condition here that
would be a bug what if we change the
order of these checks so I take months
greater than six and put it here months
greater than or equal to two here and
then change the return values to match
do you think this still works let's try
it
it looks like it's wrong for the first
case these cases are okay and this one
is but it looks like there aren't any
cute kittens anymore only super cute
ones and not so cute ones a kitten with
eight months will do the first check and
find that it's true and returned super
cute without ever testing to see if it's
more than six months as well no matter
what number months starts out as this
piece of code here will never run that's
a bug</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
