strings that we can't do with numbers is
we can extract sub sequences from the
strings so remember what a string is is
a sequence of characters if we have a
string we can use the square brackets to
extract parts of that string so if we
have the string Udacity and we use the
square bracket with the value 0 that
would select the 0 s character from the
string the characters of the string our
index starting from 0 so the result of
index 0 is the string with just a letter
U the expression inside the square
brackets can be anything that evaluates
to a number so we could have 1 plus 1 in
here
1 plus 1 evaluates to the number 2 and
at position 2 we find the letter A so
the value of this would be the string
containing the single letter a this
looks a little strange and we wouldn't
normally use indexing with a string
literal like this but it does work it
looks a lot more normal when we're doing
it with a variable we've initialized the
variable name to the string Dave then
when we do name index 0 whatever the
variable name is that will give us the
first letter of that string in this case
it's the uppercase D let's try that in
the Python interpreter so here i've
defined the variable name with the value
the string Dave and I'm printing named
index 0 I get the first letter if I try
instead to print named index 3 that will
give us the 4th letter the II suppose I
tried to do name index 4 well there's no
character at position 4 remember that
the indexes start at 0 so this is 0 1 2
3 when I run this what I get is an error
I get an error because I've asked for
position 4 of the string that's out of
range
so the error I gets is that that string
index is out of range what I can do is
use negative numbers when I use negative
numbers in my index it starts counting
from the back of the string so name
index negative 1 will give us the last
character in the string if I do name
index negative 2
that will give us the next-to-last
character which is the V</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
