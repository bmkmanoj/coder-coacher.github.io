number of variables we can write a
boolean formula that can be satisfied if
and only if exactly one of these
variables is set to true and we figure
out that we can do this for any number
of variables that we want so now let's
go back to the snapshots and see what
the boolean formula that I just showed
you has to do with these snapshots each
snapshot as we said basically consists
of three components so we have the
read-only memory here which is basically
the input we have the program and we
have the readwrite memory for
intermediate results and output so now
let's think back a moment of how we
defined the RAM when we define the RAM
in the last unit what we said was the
following we said that whenever we're
talking about memories so this part here
or this part here then every single cell
in the memory cannot hold arbitrarily
large variables which means for example
that this cell here could either be 0 it
could be 1 it could be 2 and so on but
there's a certain limit of how large
those values here can be just as with
your novel computer programs - they can
carry very very large numbers but
there's a limit and that limit is some
constant so I'll just write write C here
so if you have an 8-bit computer that
constant will be smaller of course than
if you have a 16-bit computer and so on
but in any case it will be some constant
determined by the machine and the same
thing is going to be true all along the
memory so for each single memory cell
that you have here you have a constant
number of possibilities for the values
that this memory cell can take so the
size here is constant and here it's
polynomial in n as we figured out before
now what about the program so for the
program we said that of course the size
of the program of the algorithm does not
change with the size of the input so if
you look at the program and you write it
as we said here we've written the code
from left to right but normally you'd
write it from top to bottom so if you
took this code and wrote it like this
then you would have a constant number of
lines in your program and there would be
a certain position
where you are so again here there's a
constant number of potential positions
where you can be in the code and of
course you just have have one code so so
there's no polynomial size here it's
just a constant number of code lines and
finally over here for the input well of
course this is read-only but what I'm
interested in is again the possible
number of states that you can have in
each of these memory cells and that
again is the same constant as over here
and here we have again a polynomial in n
so what does this have to do with the
boolean formula that I just showed you
well what we could do is turn this into
a boolean formula with a huge number of
variables but you will see that the
number of variables is still polynomial
so what are my variables going to be I'm
going to have one variable for each of
those black boxes here and also one
variable for each of these here and so
on and so on and so on
I'm going to have one variable for all
of the possibilities where I could be in
my program code and again here I'm going
to do the same thing as I did here on
the left side I will have one boolean
variable for each of those possibilities
and what one of those boolean variables
means is basically or what I wanted to
mean is if it's set to true it tells me
that a memory cell contains that value
so if this variable here is set to true
I want that memory cell up here to
contain the value 0 if it's set to 1 I
want this one here to contain the value
1 if it's set to 2 I want this one here
to have the value 2 and so on and now
you see why the boolean formula that I
just showed you why where you can force
just exactly one single variable to be
true is useful in this case because if I
put all of these variables here into
such a boolean formula I would have a
boolean formula that can be satisfied if
and only if exactly one of those
variables here is true so it tells me
uniquely what goes into this memory cell
here as
as it satisfied and the same thing over
here and over here and over here and now
if I write this boolean formula for this
memory cell here I write it for this
memory cell here here of course also and
so on and if I combine all of those
boolean formulas so I have a boolean
formula here have a boolean formula here
I have one here from this column from
this column from this column and so on
so I have a boolean formula and then I
do an end and I have the next boolean
formula and I have an end and I do the
next boolean formula and I'll continue
doing this and I will also do this here
for the program then of course I will
get a very very very large boolean
formula</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
