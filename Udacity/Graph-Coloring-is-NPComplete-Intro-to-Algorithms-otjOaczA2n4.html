a little magic trick having to do with
coloring in regions in a map this
problem is sometimes called map coloring
and just to remind you the idea there is
that each of the regions in the map
we're going to assign some color to it
with the constraint that there can't be
the same color in two adjacent regions
on the map because then it'll kind of
make it look like one big region we can
actually think of this as a problem on
graphs in particular we're going to make
each region on the map correspond to a
node in a graph and we're going to
connect two nodes of the graph if they
share a border and therefore can't have
the same color in the map a shares
borders with B and F F shares borders
with G B and a B shares borders with a
and F that we have already and G and C C
shares borders with D and H 8 shares
border with G and E and D G C D E G C D
E D and E share border did I get
everything H doesn't connect to B G
doesn't connect to C as it does G has
borders with FB C and H so given that
transformation the equivalent graph
coloring problem is going to be given a
graph G and some number K can we assign
each of the nodes in the graph a color
specifically some number between from 1
to K so that neighbors in the graph have
different colors have different numbers
assigned to them turns out this problem
comes up a lot not just in geography but
also in lots of computer science
applications for example in compilers
trying to figure out how to use the the
registers of the computer to solve or to
evaluate expressions and it also comes
up in social network problems you can
imagine saying ok I've got a group of
people here's their friend network what
I'd like to do is group them into K
different groups
so that within each group there's no no
pairwise friends so you can think of
this as as building a mixer right like a
party where you want to invite your
friends but you want them to interact
with people that they aren't already
friends with</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
