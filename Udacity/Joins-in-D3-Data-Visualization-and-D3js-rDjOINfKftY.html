joins in the case of two tables let's
think of table 1 as our data file in
this case data tsv where every row is a
row in our file and table 2 here for the
department are all the HTML and SVG
elements on our webpage and when we
perform that magical data join we simply
associate every row in our data file
with the corresponding element on our
webpage in the case of our scatterplot
we are adding circles based on some
common key that associates the two
elements the question naturally arises
what happens two rows in the tables they
either don't have a match or elements on
our webpage that don't have
corresponding data to bind to well that
is exactly what the special selection
enter that follows the data bindings for
and before moving on just to make this
example a tiny bit more concrete in d3
there's the idea of a key that maps data
to elements as long as the data has the
same key in this case department ID as
to an HTML element that has previously
been bound they'll map to the same let's
say for example on the first time
through our code we have an empty
selection for the circle elements before
the data bind when we bind our data to
the empty selection think of it as
creating something of an imaginary place
holder that has the value of our data so
in this case for every row in our data
table it will actually create an
adjacent second department table the dot
enter selection corresponds to all of
these elements in this new mirror table
that the data bind creates which then
get appended to whatever we first
selected in this case the SVG element so
on the first time through there's no
circles on the page we bind data select
all the bound data to placeholder circle
they are not yet on our page which there
won't be any and then for every one of
those we append a circle to our SVG
element now if we want to rerun this
code without changing data or without
changing our selections nothing will
happen the reason being is that since
the data never changed the key of the
bound data never changed so our enter
selection which corresponds to all the
new elements to draw on the page will
simply be empty so we don't append
anything new in theory we could run this
line of code a hundred times and our
chart won't change as long as our data
and our selections don't change and
again this is one of the strengths of
the declarative syntax and allows us to
build complex animations were only some
elements of our data or some elements of
our web page actually change from one
frame to the next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
