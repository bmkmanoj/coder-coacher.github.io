programming assignment and there's many
different ways to structure this but
that's what I've done I have a DT equals
zero point one I set my initial state
vector to be the initial X&amp;amp;Y coordinates
and for the two velocities are set them
both to zero
my u vector as a set in the statement of
the problem is zero everywhere so just
ignore it interesting is my P matrix
that measures the uncertainty and I set
the uncertainty initially for the
locations to be zero these are the two
main diagonal elements over here and the
uncertainty for the velocities to be
really high as a thousand so this is my
initial uncertainty matrix their
guarantees that I can really estimate
velocity based on data and I believe the
initial state estimates are correct our
F matrices for dimension generalization
of the F - wait before where we have one
along the main diagonal this one says
that the position is retained in
expectation and velocity is retained and
we have two DTS over here the X dot
which is my third state vector
influences the X by a factor of DT for
each timestamp and the same is true for
y dot so these are the places where our
velocities impact our position estimate
and then as I scroll down the H matrix
is a four by two projection matrix we
project out the X dimension and the Y
dimension without any velocities for the
measurement uncertainty assume that each
measurement has uncertainty covariance
of 0.1 and these are along the main
diagonal of this tuba - measurement
noise uncertainty matrix and this is
obviously how a four dimensional
identity matrix looks over here so if I
run this for my first example where the
measurements are 5 6 7 8 9 and 10 in the
second dimension 10 8 6 4 2 and you
can't see it but it's 0 over here in my
output I correctly get the estimate of
10 for my X and 0 for my Y and the
velocity is 10 and minus 20 and as we
had before because DT for 0.1 is step
from 5 to 6 within a tenth of a time
unit
velocity of 10 and from 10 to 8 1 of -20
these are numbers are correct we can
also look at the covariance matrix and
it's hard to read anything off it other
than be a fairly certain as to what our
location is and we have a very good
estimate of what velocities are our
covariance of velocity uncertainty is
0.1 this is down from a thousand which
was the initial value in these
uncertainties go to the second example
I know commented away first example and
put in place the second example if I run
it again here we see the first time
mention before minus 4 1 6 11 16 second
imagine 8 4 0 minus 4 minus 8 and these
are the exact same values over here 16
and minus 8 for velocity as I get 50 and
minus 40 which exactly the correct
velocities finally for a third example
with the first coordinate doesn't change
at all you get the correct one over here
and velocity of 0 second corner goes
from 1917 all the way to 11 get 11 over
here and velocity of minus 20 so this is
the implementation I wanted you to do if
you implemented this thing over here you
got it right and congratulations you
implement it a fairly non-trivial Kalman
filter in stages but through this class
you now have code that allows you to run
Kalman filters on complicated problems
and I hope you really got an
understanding of the common filter works</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
