which represent how much time I've
worked and how much money I make I want
to visualize these and the best way to
do that is with a graph and here is my
graph paper this line here is called the
x axis and this one's the y axis the
first thing I'm going to do is decide on
a scale and I'm going to choose the
scale on the x axis that goes up by 5s 5
10 15 20 and of course 0 here I'm going
to have my y-axis increment by 50 and
note that this point here has 0 for its
x value and for its y value this point
we call the origin but back to our
ordered pairs well how am I going to put
5 comma 50 on the graph I'm going to
look at five which means okay go over
here to where X is 5 which is this line
and then I'm going to go up to where Y
is 50 which is up to here and then I'm
going to put a dot likewise for 10 100
go over to 10 up to 100 and put a dot
and again 2,200 over 220 up to 200 and
put a dot once i have a few dots i can
start to connect them now using this
graph maybe you can answer a question
for me how much would i make if I work
for 15 hours enter unions are here and
I've already given you the dollar sign</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
