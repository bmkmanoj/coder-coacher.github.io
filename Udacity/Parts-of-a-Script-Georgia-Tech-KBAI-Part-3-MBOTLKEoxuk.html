representation called script has six
parts to it the first part is called
entry conditions these are the
conditions necessary to execute the
script so for a restaurant script as an
example the entry condition might be
that it is a customer who is hungry and
the customer has some money result
refers to the conditions that will
become true after this script has
occurred after that has taken place so
for a restaurant script the result might
be the owner of some restaurant has more
money the customer has less money the
customer is not pleased and is no longer
hungry so the third part of the script
is our props so the third part of script
are called props props are the kind of
objects that are involved in the
execution of the script so in case of
the restaurant script the props might
include tables and menus and food items
and so on so the fourth part of the
script is roles these are the agents
involved in the execution of the script
as an example in the restaurant script
it might be a customer who goes to a
restaurant the owner of the restaurant
the waiter the waitresses in the
restaurant and so on the fifth element
of a script is a track track are
variations of subclasses of a particular
script so for example in case of the
restaurant script we may have tracks
were going to a coffee house or going to
a fast food restaurant going to a fine
dining house and finally the sixth
element of a script refers two seasons
scenes are specific sequence of events
that occur during the execution of the
script so in case of the restaurant
script they might be a scene for
entering a restaurant under the scene
for ordering food as the third scene for
accepting the food and so on when you
put all of the six elements together
then you get a complete script in the
previous lesson we have taken the
metaphor of a molecule as a knowledge
representation that is knowledge
representations that are not small or
short or not atomic but our molecular
nature script is a big large molecule</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
