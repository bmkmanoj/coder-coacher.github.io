oversimplifying are there a few other
things so there are few other bits that
can go with this other information that
we're talking about in particular
there's an interesting thing called set
UID and maybe you know we want to talk
about this little bit so think about a
game program that needs to update a file
that stores the scores different people
who have played this game so when these
people are playing the game of course we
want to be able to update that file and
you score increases you want to update
your score that's in there so these
users while playing the game when they
play the game need to have write access
to that file when they're not playing
the game we don't want them to have
write access because then they can go
change the score without playing the
game so we don't want that so how can we
solve this problem these systems I'm
talking about this problem is solved by
having something called a set UID bit so
the way to understand this is that we
have Alice and Bob and Bob owns the game
file and Ellis wants to play the game so
the game file actually is owned by Bob
and Bob is gonna give permission to
Alice to execute be able to execute this
file by the way the score file is also
Bob is going to own the core and is not
going to grant write access to Alice
Alice should not be able to update that
file unless he's playing the game so you
can think about the score file Alice can
read it her score and somebody else's
score how people are doing but she can't
write it Bob and read write it because
Bob owns the aim file that we have here
his some special user or someone who's
running this program that we have people
want to play the game so set UID bit it
said on the game file the executable
file that we have and we said Alice
execute this file when she wants to play
the game so set UID bit when it's set on
an executable file actually does an
interesting thing when Alice execute
this file the user ID temporarily
changes from Alice to Bob okay so it
says when it set UID file is executed
the user ID the effective user ID at
that point is not the user who actually
executed the file but is
owner of this file in this case the
owner of the file is Bob so during the
execution of the game all the Alice is
playing the game during the execution of
the game the temporary or effective UID
is Bob and because of that even though
Alice is filling the game she is able to
update the file file is updated back
that is in this game file and while we
are executing the game file as we said
the effective user ID becomes Bob Alice
launched this program but the program is
owned by somebody else
this change in UID is possible when the
executable file that Alice executes the
game file here has a set UID bit set so
set UID bit is used to change the UID
temporarily during the execution of the
program on which this bit is set and I
hope I motivated why you may want to do
that in this case for example the game
file that we are talking about</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
