the counter will be incremented every
time we look at a word not only when we
find the long word because we want to
count how many short words come before
the long word let's try to hand trace a
little bit and see if this would work if
the first word is longer than nine
characters that would mean we would want
to return a position of zero so we would
go into the loop we would find the word
we would go into the if statement
because the word length would be longer
than nine we would mark the word as
found and then we would increment
position to one okay that's not quite
right so maybe this will need to start
at negative one so that'll fix it for
the case where the first word is long
what if the first word is short and the
second word is long we'll start with
position as negative one go into the
while loop there are more words and it's
not found yet we read the word the word
is short so we skip past the if
statement and increment the position to
zero now we go back into the loop there
are more words and we still haven't
found it we read the second word which
is long so we go into the if statement
set long word to be the word that we
just read and say that we've found it
then update the position which was
previously zero so now it'll be one and
then get back to the while loop but we
marked it as found so we break out this
should work but I forgot to print it
alright it looks like the first long
word in Alice in Wonderland is
Adventures and its position is one let's
compare this to the text it looks like
Adventures is in position one and it's
no wonder it would be related to the
book it's part of the title</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
