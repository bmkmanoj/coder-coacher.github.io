disease is the oldest data standard
dating back to the 1800s and in a sense
even to earlier centuries when
researchers first became interested in
the causes of human mortality
traditionally it's been a list or
classification of medical diagnosis it's
maintained by the World Health
Organization and is updated every 10
years with the latest version being
icd-10 which was adopted in 1994 here in
the US we're still using icd-9 even
though most other countries are using 10
icd-10 is a major expansion capable of
representing many more clinical details
we can see that here by comparing the
coding systems capabilities for breast
cancer in icd-9 we know what portion of
the breast is involved the central
portion here but we don't know which
breast in icd-10 we not only know which
portion of the breast is involved but we
know whether it's the right or the left
breast so in icd-10 laterality is
represented which greatly increases the
number of codes which is a big part of
the objection to using it here in the US
in fact icd-10 really becomes an
ontology capable of representing
clinical relationships here we can see
that the patient has gout affecting
their left shoulder but they have not
yet developed a uric acid deposit called
at ophis in that shoulder we can also
see that the etiology or the reason for
their gout is kidney failure the current
u.s. target date for icd-10 adoption is
October first 2015 but given how close
we are to icd-11 there are some
proposals to skip icd-10 entirely</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
