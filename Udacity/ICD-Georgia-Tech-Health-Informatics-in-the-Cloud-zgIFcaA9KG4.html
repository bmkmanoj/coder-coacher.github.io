disease is the oldest data standard
dating back to the 1800s and in a sense
even to earlier centuries when
researchers first became interested in
the causes of human mortality
traditionally it's been a list or
classification of medical diagnoses it's
maintained by the World Health
Organization and is updated every 10
years with the latest version being
icd-10 which was adopted in 1994 here in
the US we're still using icd-9 even
though most other countries are using 10
icd-10 is a major expansion capable of
representing many more clinical details
we can see that here by comparing the
coding systems capabilities for breast
cancer in icd-9 we know what portion of
the breast is involved the central
portion here but we don't know which
breast in icd-10 we not only know which
portion of the breast is involved but we
know whether it's the right or the left
breast
so in icd-10 laterality is represented
which greatly increases the number of
codes which is a big part of the
objection to using it here in the u.s.
in fact icd-10 really becomes an
ontology capable of representing
clinical relationships here we can see
that the patient has gout affecting
their left shoulder but they have not
yet developed a uric acid deposit called
at ofus in that shoulder we can also see
that the etiology or the reason for
their gout is kidney failure the current
u.s. target date for icd-10 adoption is
October 1st 2015 but given how close we
are to icd-11 there are some proposals
to skip icd-10 entirely</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
