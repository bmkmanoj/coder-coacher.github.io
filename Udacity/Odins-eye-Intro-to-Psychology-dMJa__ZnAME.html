at me but I am plagued with an
unfortunate circumstance you see I'm
nearsighted
which means the lenses in my eyes are a
little shall we say overzealous and they
bend light just slightly too much since
the light does not bend around my retina
my world is a blur but of course with
every problem there is a solution by
placing a diverging lens in front of my
eyes I could fix my faulty vision and to
think for years I was condemned to
wearing glasses me in glasses how passe
how cliche I thought I always as
appalled then as I am sure you are now
but I did find a solution with Odin's
eye monocles with Odin's eye monocles I
can fix my vision with style one eye at
a time
it works for farsighted people too so if
I have trouble reading as I age I can
simply by a converging lens to fix that
problem as well but I know what you
might be saying what about your depth
perception
how can you gauge distance if you only
have one eye working at a time
well I laugh at your child's notion of
binocular depth perception if I
discovered that monocular cues have
served me just fine by looking at the
relative size of objects or taken
advantage of linear perspective or
interposition I have been able to gauge
distance quite well quite well indeed
Odin's eye it worked for me will you let
it work for you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
