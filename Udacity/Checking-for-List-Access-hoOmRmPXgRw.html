rules besides checking if the user is
the owner of the list is to check
whether the user is shared on the list a
prime example of this is the read rule
for the shopping list items so using the
shared with table can you check if the
current user is shared on the shopping
list so if you're talking about a
shopping list and you go over to user
lists and you look at the details of
shopping list you can see the owners
here but because we've de normalized
some stuff there are kind of parts of a
shopping list which are located at
different parts of the database one
example being shopping list items and
also shared with both of these are
associated with a single shopping list
so let's say we are looking at the items
for this shopping list shopping list k 7
j 8 k and remember that shopping list
owner is kagura as shown here if I'm
over here in shopping list items I can
drill down and I don't really see who
the owner of the shopping list is that's
not stored here the owner of each of the
items is stored here but not the owner
of the entire shopping list which is
important for some checks and this leads
to kind of long and difficult to read
rules for shopping list items when I
want to say something like the owner of
the shopping list can read these items
so can you think of a better solution
for getting the owner of a shopping list
and using it in the rules for shopping
list items and shared with maybe you can
draw some inspiration from the uid
mapping note that you just created I'll
go ahead and send a respect right now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
