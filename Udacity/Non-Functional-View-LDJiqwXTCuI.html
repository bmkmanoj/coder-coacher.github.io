consider to be quite important and
that's the non-functional view in coming
up with a software architecture it's
your responsibility not only to describe
a system with its going to compute what
it needs to compute but also computed in
a way that satisfies those
non-functional requirements satisfying
non-functional requirements is hard it
often involves some kind of trade-off
okay so you need to be expressing what
the options are and how you've decided
to trade things off and I'm suggesting
here some tabular text here's an example
if you imagine a web browser and you say
what's its major computational
responsibilities
well it's displaying web pages quite
simple
but if you actually look at the code for
a web browser it's filled with code
having to do with managing caches their
page caches and connection caches and
image caches and so on okay why are
there caches
well caches are a technique for dealing
with performance constraints a
non-functional requirement okay so it's
important to relate that information
first of all that there is a performance
requirement and second of all what
technique is being used to address that
performance requirement the caches</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
