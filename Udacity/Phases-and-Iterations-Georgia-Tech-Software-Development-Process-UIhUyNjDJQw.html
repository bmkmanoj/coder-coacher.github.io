lesson by going back to our discussion
of rational unified process phases and
iterations so to do that I'm gonna bring
back the representation that I used
before the summary representation about
phases and traditional software
engineering activities and I want to use
this representation to stress and
discuss a couple of things mainly I want
to recap because I think it is very
important what is the relation between
the rational unified process and the
traditional software engineering phases
and software engineering activities and
I'd like to do it now that we have
discussed the phases in a little more
detail so I want to make sure that it's
clear by now how and when the
traditional software engineering
activities the ones listed here take
place in the context of the RUP phases
the four listed up here for instance it
should be clear why implementation takes
place mainly in the construction phase
why requirements engineering is
prominent in the elaboration phase and
why deployment activities occur mostly
in the transition phase and so on so it
should be clear now why the activities
are so distributed in the four phases it
should also be clear that although there
is normally one main phase for each
activity the activities really spend
multiple phases which is actually one of
the interesting aspects of RUP so the
fact that you are not really done with
an activity even in later phases why all
because that allows you in subsequent
iterations to address problems they came
up in previous iterations</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
