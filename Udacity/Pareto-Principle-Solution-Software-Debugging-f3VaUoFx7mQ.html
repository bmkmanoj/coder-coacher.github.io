correlates the more experience the
higher the bug density this may come as
a surprise to you but here's the story
behind it we mined the eclipse bug
database and checked for the experience
and contributions of the individual
developers it turned out that the
Eclipse project lead Erich gamma had the
second-highest defect density in his
code across all the developers now Erich
gamma is anything but nobody he gave the
world unit tests he gave the world
design patterns and he gave the
world.they cliffs programming
environment always with the team of
course but still so why would his body
density be the second-highest across all
Eclipse developers the reason is simple
suppose this is you you have been
assigned to fix a bug you look at the
problem and you find oh this is terribly
hard so what you do is you delegate the
problem to your boss who's way more
experienced than you now your boss is
looking at the code and says oh this is
something I can't handle and he
delegates this to his lead and this guy
says ah this looks really really really
hard only one person in the world can do
that and this is Erich gamma the team
leader who has no one else to delegate
to so being the team leader he gets the
toughest problems that is those problems
where the chances of screwing up are the
highest still he's the man because
anybody else dealing with this problem
would on average make a worse job than
Erich gamma this is how the more
experienced people get the tougher tasks
possibly introduce more defects
but still overall they are precisely the
right persons to do the job</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
