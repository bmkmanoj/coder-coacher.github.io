in analyzing social networks and
learning about what's going on inside of
them he has been a professor at Columbia
University and also a network scientist
at Yahoo research and most recently he's
moved to microsoft research in New York
City we weren't able to get video
footage of our conversation together but
I think you'll find it interesting
anyway what are some of the factors that
have contributed to the explosion of
interest in social network analysis so
what's changed recently I'm really just
in the last few years with when they
expire impossible alivet East in some
instances to see precisely how
information spreads from one individual
to another I wrote this book called six
degrees in almost ten years ago now is
published in 2003 one of the messages
that I tried to convey in in that purple
is that what we now call network science
is both inferior and also in practice a
multi-disciplinary endeavor you know the
origins of what we think of is network
science now really began in their social
sciences it was an enormous influx of
physicists into this app to this field
in the late 1990s and then as the web
continue to evolve and you see the
computer scientists get more and more
involved because they're you know
probably the best equipped to handle
very large data sets many people are
interested in this question of how did
you sort of replicate the success of
Facebook and the best of our scientific
understanding is that you sort of can't
really there's a lot of a very sort of
specific algorithms that Network
analysts use you know everything from
you know very simple breadth-first
search algorithms to community detection
algorithms thin where the state of the
art challenges lying least in the recent
years has been
implementation particularly scaling
issues pretty much everything these days
is done using MapReduce all right so I
think that if you want to work with very
large scale network data then some
familiarity with the MapReduce framework
and and you know whichever
implementation I guess loop is the most
common one these days is going to be
extremely valuable and there's been some
interesting theoretical work showing how
algorithms like predator first search
can be converted into am a producer
parallel framework and that's actually
generated a great deal of recent
progress can you tell us a little bit
about the idea of community detection
you want to assign everybody in the
network to a community such that the
communities you choose have the property
that most of the links are within the
communities not across the communities
one of the methods that was developed by
my colleague Jake Hoffman Microsoft but
when he was at Columbia it's close to
class stochastic walk model where you're
you are starting with a network and you
are assigning you start with some to
prior assumption about how many how many
communities there are network I mean
sort of make a guess about who goes into
which community and then you measure the
relative densities of internal versus
external links and then you shuffle back
and forth making various random changes
to try to optimize the this the
allocation of people to communities in
order to get this sort of maximization
of modularity</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
