studio we'll create a basic Android
application that has a single empty
activity I'm just going to call it
location 1 and it's in this location the
company domain you can put whatever you
like I'm just going to keep Android
example calm I'm going to make it a
jelly bean application for phone and
tablets
and like I said earlier it's going to be
a single blank activity I'll keep the
defaults and continue now once this has
been created I'm going to edit the
activity to add a single textview when
you run the app location services will
start getting updates and it will write
details about them to this textview to
edit the text view in the activity
editor just select the text tab and you
can see what your layout would look like
so here's the basic layout that has been
built for you in the default in Android
studio you can see it already has a
textview and the text for this is held
in a string referred to in strings that
XML called hello world
I'm just going to change that to
something hard-coded for now I'll just
say location goes here
and then I'm going to give this control
an ID so I'm gonna give it the ID like
this Android : ID equals @ + ID / txt
output so when I refer to this control
in code and in a few moments you'll see
that the control will be called txt
output so this control is where the
location is going to get written so when
we get details from location services in
this case the latitude of the phone will
write it into this control called txt
output and if I look at the design you
can see location goes here it's faint
but you can see it's there in this one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
