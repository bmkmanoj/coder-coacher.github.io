it's a lot like looking for any other
framework that you might bring into your
code you want to see if it's well
supported when was it last updated if
it's a github project you can see when
the last commit was if there's people
that are making pull request if is
actively used by other developers all
these things would be great signs that
this API outside of what is functionally
doing is a good call and then you want
to make sure of course that it can do
what you need it to do and testing
around with it playing with it you could
play with a couple different options and
find one that works and that's how I
choose web api is it's the same way that
I choose frameworks so for finding and
vetting libraries I tend to first go to
the Apple libraries they tend to be much
better documented and more highly
optimized for the hardware that you're
working on in iOS one of the libraries
that I first investigated for a video
player app was the MP movie player
controller which is a simple
implementation of a view controller for
playing a video it's very quick and easy
to get up and running but it doesn't
really provide anything else I wanted
more features that i could add i wanted
a new interface i wanted i wanted to be
able to play with the video even more so
i looked even further and apple provides
the AV foundation library which allows
audio video audio synthesizing video
effects all these different tools that
MP movie player controllers don't
provide and they allow you to create a
much more rich user experience for the
people using your app I use this on a
nap at a previous company and it allowed
us to create this user interface that
was unique to our app that you could you
can't find anywhere else</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
