table save space let's look at an
example of a simple and small two level
page table in this example we will use a
very small virtual address where we have
an offset and the page number and each
of this is 4 bits so using a flat page
table we would need 2 to the fourth
entries in it one for each possible page
number so the entries will be numbered 0
through 15 and we would index with our
page number here and get our frame
number with the two-level page table
let's say we split this 4-bit page
number into two two-bit pieces so the
same virtual address still has a 4-bit
page number that we split into two
two-bit pieces the outer part of the
page number is used to index into a four
entry outer page table and each entry in
this outer page table can point to a
four entry inner page table so in total
we have four inner page tables once we
find the pointer to the correct one we
can use the inner part of the page
number to tell us which entry to use and
that gives us our frame number so as
indicated previously the total size of
all the inner page tables here is the
same as the original size of the flat
page table here we had 16 entries here
we have four times four entries here
plus we added the space for the outer
page table so where are the savings the
savings are in that if there is an
unused large part of the address space
such that all of these entries do not
correspond to physical memory then we
don't need this and we can mark here in
the outer page table that the entry is
not necessary and then we can eliminate
this inner page table in a large address
space the outer page table will have
many pointers most of which will point
to inner page tables like this so we
eliminate them so we end up having one
reasonably large outer page table but
one that we can fit
memory and a small number of inner page
tables each of which is reasonably sized
and fits in memory but we don't have
most of the inner page tables so we save
a lot of space</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
