as a way to understand our users
attributes and their behaviors yeah and
remember we asked you to come up with a
three features for Pizza application for
Android and we have the situation where
you came up with a feature list and yeah
we each came up with a different one and
we had gone over two options which is to
combine the features or just pick one of
our feature sets but those are actually
both not the right thing to do the way
we really should have started was to
start with personas and use cases
because we could have debated and talked
about features all day everybody had
really great ideas of features but if we
had started with personas and use cases
we would have come up with very
different feature lists a persona is a
proxy for a group of actual users of a
product for whom the UX is going to be
optimized a use case is the scenario of
how when and where a persona will use
your product to accomplish a task</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
