it's actually secure and we're going to
focus first on secure against a passive
eavesdropper so this is an adversary
that can listen in on all the messages
but can't modify them so that means the
adversary will be able to get the public
values Q and G will also be able to hear
all the messages transmitted so be able
to learn why a and why B and our goal is
to be confident that the adversary would
not be able to learn kab so the question
is which of these would be most
convincing improving that the
diffie-hellman protocol is secure the
first is that showing that the number of
possible XA values to guess is too high
the second is showing that an attacker
who could solve a known hard problem
would be able to compute the key and the
third is showing that an attacker who
can compute the key would be able to
solve some known hard problem</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
