and we really haven't talked a lot about
track so far so let's talk a little bit
more about it so here are four tracks
with the restaurant script that really
refers to going to restaurant of four
kinds here is a coffee house fast food
casual dining formal dining you could
add more if you want to do now in
restaurants of all kinds some events are
common you have to go to a restaurant
you have to order some food you eat that
food you pay the bill and then you leave
that is common to all of them which is
why all of them are part of the
restaurant script on the other hand what
happens in the coffee house is quite
different for what happens in formal
dining which is we're quite different
for what happens in a fast-food
restaurant so you may have specific
tracks that correspond to coffee houses
and fast foods and so on in fact we are
building a semantic hierarchical script
it is this crate for going to your
restaurant it is a script for going to a
coffee house going to fast food and
these can be cracks in the overall
script of course we can build a semantic
hierarchy or something higher than this
we could think about going to for social
events and they are going to as
restaurant becomes part of a going to a
social event of a this kind okay now
that we know something about the
knowledge representation called script
the next question becomes how many air
agent actually used the scripts so
imagine an AI agent that is hungry and
has some money and decides to do
something about it so it may go into its
long-term memory and find out the script
that will be most useful for the current
situation this really becomes a
classification problem in long-term
memory are large number of scripts and
the agent is trying to classify the
current situation into one of those
scripts let us suppose the agent fix a
restaurant scripting decides to execute
it as it enters a restaurant the scene
it observes in the restaurant matches
the conditions of a fast-food script so
it decides to invoke your fast-food
script this way the robot I walked down
the semantic hierarchy first in working
the restaurant script then working the
fast-food script and so on now a robot
could have taken a different stance a
robot could have decided to planning
given some initial conditions and gold
conditions a robot may have used the
operators available to it to generate a
plant at runtime where the script is
doing it it is giving it a plan in a
compiled form the robot doesn't have to
generate this plan at runtime it is
already available in memory in a priest
or form
this is very useful because one of the
central conundrums that we have been
talking about is how is it possible that
air agents can address computationally
complex problems with limited resources
in near real time in a complex dynamic
world panic and take a lot of time but
if I already have this stored plans then
in working the script and executing it
is much faster</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
