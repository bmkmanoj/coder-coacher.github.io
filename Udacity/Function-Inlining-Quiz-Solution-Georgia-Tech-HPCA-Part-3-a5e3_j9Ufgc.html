quiz now let's talk about its solution
after scheduling how many cycles well
let's see first what the scheduling will
do we have a load we have to do it
before the call and after the call we
can do the store so really scheduling
can do nothing here here we need to do
the multiplication and then the a
depends on it and then we can only
return so really there is nothing
scheduling can do here so really we just
need to figure out for this sequence of
instructions how many cycles does it
take to do it one way of doing that
would be to say that the load begins in
the first cycle in the second cycle it's
still going on so we can use the result
in the third cycle in the second cycle
however we can do the call the call also
takes two cycles so we really can
execute this instruction in cycle four
at that time a zero is available the
multiplication takes three cycles so in
cycles four five and six the
multiplication is happening and only
cycles seven can we do this because it's
using the result of this instruction we
can do the return immediately afterwards
so return now is happening in cycles
eight and nine and finally in cycle 10
we are back here and then the store of
course takes only one cycle so really
after 10 cycles we are done now let us
see what the inlining will do what it
will do is it will simply take these two
instructions and replace the call with
them now let's see can we do some
scheduling around it we need to load a
zero then we're gonna use it in
multiplication then we're gonna use it
in the addition and then we're gonna use
the result of it in the store so again
scheduling is not going to help us here
however we have eliminated the call and
the return so now what happens is we
have the load begins in cycle one next
we will try to do the multiplication but
we can only do it in cycle three cause
the load needs to produce the value for
two cycles in cycles one and two before
we can use it next we have the
multiplication happening in cycles three
four and five so we can only do this in
cycle six the add only takes one cycle
and the store can then happen in cycle
seven and that's when it finishes so
after in lining
scheduling we have reduced this to seven
cycles mainly by eliminating the call
and the return</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
