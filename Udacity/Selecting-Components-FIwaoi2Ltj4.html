components is to say well what is it the
system is supposed to do or compute and
break that down into into pieces however
there are many other factors that might
go into deciding which components are
going to be part of your system of
course required functionality is most
important there but it may also be the
case that you already have some existing
reusable components from your libraries
that you want to build into your system
and that may have an important role in
deciding on the overall component
structure as with the physical machine
architecture that is the architecture
providing you multiple cores in which
case how can you take advantage of those
in in breaking down your computation
another element you might not have
thought of is your staff that is the
people who are going to do this Conway's
law says that the ultimate structure of
a system depends upon the structure of
the organization building it so it's
well to take into account that if you
have three people helping you lay out
the architecture you're likely to end up
with three major components another
important element is that for real
systems they're going to have long
lifetimes and the trajectory of that
lifetime the direction which is going to
move as we saw in the viraf definition
could and should strongly influenced the
components into which you divide it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
