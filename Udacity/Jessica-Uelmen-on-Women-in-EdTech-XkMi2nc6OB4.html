the program manager for mobile nano
degrees here at Udacity thank you so
much for talking to us today happy to be
here my pleasure so the first thing I
wanted to ask you was that there's this
trend in technology that the technology
industry tends to be very male-oriented
and there's this perception that
therefore any educational technology
that comes out of the technology
industry will also be oriented towards
more male style always learning so what
can we do when we're designing
educational technology to make sure that
we're not preserving this trend of it
being by men for men yeah it's it's a
really tough question and a tough thing
to to address but I think it really
starts with awareness which is great to
be here and talking about it already but
really scrutinizing and looking at
what's being designed looking at things
through a neutral lens or then even
getting you know feedback from from
women or from other you know teachers
education as a field is primarily
dominated by women so it's kind of
interesting that ed tech then becomes
more male skewed so I think if there's a
way to sort of start blending those
those worlds well we'll get to a little
more diverse pool yeah thanks a lot
since I actually hadn't thought about
that before but you're right that we
have technology that's very
male-oriented with teaching tends to be
very female oriented and so there's a
lot of great overlap there in la chance
for collaboration as long as we actually
go out and do it absolutely and talking
to teachers i think is something that
anyone designing educational technology
needs to do more of anyway and so now it
kind of kill two birds with one stone
yeah so but given that we're probably
not going to change the entire industry
in the next four months office students
currently in the class what are some
considerations they should make when
you're developing their tools besides
possibly going on talking to teachers
are there any things they can keep in
mind um I think maybe just even
surveying the landscape I mean there's
also people do a lot of efforts for
putting educational technology solutions
towards women and a lot of times
unfortunately that's like making it pink
so let's let's not make it pink okay but
looking at those solutions may be seeing
seeing what they're doing and seeing how
it might be able to adapt to to what
they're building and so I think that the
other thing that comes up comes up here
is that if our ultimate goal is
you make the technology industry itself
a little bit less male-dominated the
people in this class will go on to
careers technology what can they do when
they're in their future workplaces or
the current work places they can kind of
try and combat this trained a little bit
yeah I mean I think the main thing and
and something that I always push for is
not necessarily making the woman a
commodity you know it's not hire because
you know she's a woman or it's not
collaborating because she's a woman and
it's a very difficult thing to do
because if you look at you know the
percentages and it's like wow there's
not a whole lot of women here we need to
hire women but that's that's not always
the best solution and then when there
are you know women in the workplace and
maybe in leadership roles making their
impact more visible externally and
internally will sort of help fill that
role model role that we're always
talking about we need more women in you
know tech role models but doing so will
then hopefully inspire more people to
pursue that as a field yeah I think
there's a very interesting alignment
there between what we deal with an
industry and what we actually deal with
here in the LMS program that as i'm
recording this hopefully it will change
in future semesters the u.s. program is
ninety percent male and there's a
tendency to think if it's ninety percent
male we just need to admit more women
but that's kind of treating the symptom
as the thing to be treated as opposed to
it's a symptom of some underlying issue
on here the issue is appeal to women or
if there any obstacles that we're not
really considering they apply more to
women than men resolving those obstacles
as opposed to just you know changing
admission criteria or something like
that so and I think then also making
things a little bit more welcoming or
breaking down those like like a girl
stereotypes one of the things that
always pops into my head is I majored in
electrical engineering and so we had to
take physics classes and it was my
sophomore year and we were in a physics
study group it was me and a bunch of
guys cuz that's the way it goes and I
was helping them solve each of the
problems and I was doing a lot of the
the teaching and you know one of the
guys piped up and said hey are we gonna
let the girl teach us how it's done and
you know comments like that doesn't
really make for a welcoming you know
invite
and and it's a very benign comment right
it's not it's not meant to be hurtful
but it is uncomfortable so just try to
be aware of those types of comments yeah
it plays on some kind of assumption that
the assumptions really would need to be
addressed that comment might be harmless
but what it's you know perpetuating is
not yes absolutely oh great well thank
you so much for talking to us today yeah
my pleasure always happy to talk</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
