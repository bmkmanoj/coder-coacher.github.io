AI as we have discussed it in CS 70 637
is that AI agents use heuristics to find
solutions at a good enough they're not
necessarily optimal some schools of a I
put a lot of emphasis in finding the
optimal solution to every problem and
knowledge-based AI we consider agents
that find solutions at a good end of
Herbert Simon called is satisficing the
reason for finding solutions are the
only good NF is because of a trade-off
between computational efficiency on one
hand and optimality of solutions on the
other we can find optimal solutions but
that comes at the cost of computational
efficiency recall one of the conundrums
of AI AI agents have only limited
resources bounded rationality limited
processing power limited memory size yet
most interesting air products a
computationally intractable how can we
get AI agents to solve intractable
problems with limited rationality and
yet give near real-time performance we
can get AI agents to do that if we focus
on finding solutions that are good
enough do not necessarily optimal most
of the time you and I as human agents do
not find optimal solutions the plan you
may have to make dinner for yourself
tonight it's not necessarily optimal
it's just good enough the plan that you
have to go from your house to your
office is not necessarily optimal it's
just good enough the plan that you have
to walk from your car to your office is
not necessarily optimal it's just good
enough further AI agents use heuristics
to find solutions at a good end of they
do not do an exhaustive search even the
exhaustive search might yield more
optimal solutions because exhaustive
search is computationally costume we
came across this notion of heuristic
search several times in this course one
place where we discussed this in some
detail was an incremental concept
learning given a current concept
definition and a negative example we are
irate a new concept definition by using
heuristics like the required link
heuristic the required link heuristic
adds the must clause to the support link
between these two bricks means-ends
analysis was a heuristic method it said
that given the current position and a
gold position find the differences
and then select an operator that would
reduce a difference because main sensor
analysis was the heuristic method
sometimes it ran into problems and did
not provide guarantees of optimality but
when it worked it was very efficient
under the pace way we explicitly made
use of heuristic was indeed generate and
test method here we had a heuristic with
said do not donated a state that
duplicates a previously generated state
which made the earth method more
efficient does the focus of
knowledge-based air agents is a near
real-time performance in addressing
conditionally intractable problems with
bounded resources and yet being able to
solve a very large class of problems and
robust intelligence and flexible
intelligence and that happens not by
finding optimal solutions to a narrow
class of problems but by using
heuristics to find solutions at a good
end of two very large classes of
problems this principle comes very much
from theories of human cognition as I
mentioned earlier you must do not
normally find optimal solutions for
every problem you face however we do
manage to find solutions that a good
enough and we do so in near real time
and that's where the power lies</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
