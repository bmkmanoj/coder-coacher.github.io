algorithm and the brute force algorithm
basically considered 2 to the power of n
assignments now let's look at our smart
search tree or intelligent search tree
and see how that is structured and we're
going to do a worst-case analysis here
we start out with the graph where we
don't have any assignments and then we
branch into three different
possibilities up here we don't know
anything so we have zero vertices
assigned now since we know that we can
constructed so that in the next level we
will have at least two more vertices
assigned here we know that we have at
least two vertices assigned now we can
go one level deeper and again we will
branch into three possibilities all of
the time because we're doing your worst
case analysis of course we could already
be done or let's say we just continued
so in the next level we have again at
least two more so we have at least four
vertices assigned and so on so let's say
we continue the search tree in this
matter so we'll always get wider and
wider and wider then we know two things
one is that the number of levels that we
have can be at most n half because every
time we assign at least two vertices so
n and a half levels is the maximum
number of levels that we can have
because after that all vertices have
been assigned and another thing that we
know is that while we start out with one
possibility and each time we go one
level deeper again doing a burst case
analysis here the number of
possibilities that we consider triples
the tree basically gets wider by a
factor of three the width is x three at
each level now my question for you is if
you look at the lowest level of the
search tree each of these one down here
is an assignment of 0 and 1 to the
vertices what I would like you to think
about is how many different assignments
do we have at this level down here level
n and a half and you can assume for
simplicity that n is an even number so
and half will be some integer so I'll
give you a number of choices is it two
to the power of n assignments that we
have done here is it 3 to the power of
and a half assignments that we have down
here is it 3 to the power of n is it 22
the power of three times n or is it two
to the power of n half times three and
you might have to think about this for a
little bit but just keep in mind the
facts the number of assignments that we
are considering triples at each level
and we have n and a half levels</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
