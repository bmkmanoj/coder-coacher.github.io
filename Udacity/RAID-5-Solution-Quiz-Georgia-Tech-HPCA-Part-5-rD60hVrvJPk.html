quiz where we had a five disk array with
disks similar to what we've seen in
quizzes before and the replacement is 24
hours once a disk fails the data
capacity for 85 is just like 48 48
hundred gigabytes effectively we still
sacrifice one disk worth of capacity to
parity it's just that this parity no is
distributed among the five disks the
throughput for the five disk array
however is much better than for a rate
for for reads all of the disks now have
equal amounts of data so we can use all
five of them when we want to read for
rights now we distribute the parity axis
is among all of the disks so all of them
can now support rights but we need for
accesses so we could be doing what needs
to be done for rights at 50 megabytes
per second throughput but what needs to
be done for rights is for accesses we
need to read the data and the parity and
then update the data and the parity so
we do for accesses for every right which
means that our write throughput is going
to be one-fourth of what we can do just
like before that means that for one
fifth of a second we will be doing what
reads need to do and for the four fifths
of a second we will be doing what rights
need to do in order to achieve the same
number of reads and writes because reads
take a quarter of the time that writes
do that means that in our one fifth of a
second we will do 10 megabytes of reeds
and then in the remaining four fifth of
that second we will do 10 megabytes of
Rights that way we achieve the same
amount of reads and writes and the
overall throughput is 20 megabytes per
second this is much better than in rate
for finally our MTTF here 485 is exactly
the same as it was for 84 it is the MTTF
of one disk / 5 this is how long we have
until one of the disks fails
times how many times can we attempt a
repair until we finally experience a
failure of one of the remaining four
disks in this array so this part here is
really the expected lifetime of the four
disks left to their own devices and this
is the MTT are and what we get is the
same number here as we did for 84 which
is 20 million eight hundred thirty three
thousand three three three hours which
is more than 2,000 years again so r85
has the same data capacity and the nttf
as rate for but has significantly better
throughput for reads it has slightly
better throughput because we can use all
five disks instead of just 44 writes it
has a lot better throughput so that
means that we never really want to use a
rate for array because we can move to a
raid5 array without sacrificing data
capacity without sacrificing the MTTF
but with improving the throughput</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
