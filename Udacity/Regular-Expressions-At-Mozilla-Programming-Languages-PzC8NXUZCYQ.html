Steve Fink who has worked on regular
expressions and languages and parsing
just-in-time transformation and
optimizations for Mozilla and other open
source projects I was wondering are
there any times where you've used
regular expressions in the real world um
yeah just yesterday I was at the grocery
store and I could not find the sugar
shelf I just couldn't sorry w cream
let's cancel that so we have been having
a problem recently on the on the Firefox
browser where we get periodic stalls and
often this is some event that happened
you know keypress a timer tires off
something like that and you know we take
hundred milliseconds or something to
service it I pulled out my standard
tools which are pearl regular
expressions and I you know wrote a
little script so it's like one rate
expression to identify that this class
declaration another one to you know find
what inherits from another one to find a
run method which has to exist on all of
these which just gives me a good place
to stick my code in and it kind of
worked and that's one example of where
I've done this I tend to do this fairly
often excellent</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
