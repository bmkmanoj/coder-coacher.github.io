the world there are several root servers
which direct requests to top-level
domain servers like 4.com which in turn
direct requests to the servers for
particular domains this means that no
one DNS server needs to know all the
records for all the names and domains in
the world the records for a particular
domain like an a record for WWE and
Space Ghost comm will be found in the
authoritative nameservers for that
domain like the name server for green
space ghost comm which are listed in NS
records for the higher level zone so the
NS record for green space ghost comm
will reside in the name servers for comb
or comm either way
Calma organ edu and net and a few others
are global top-level domains or gTLDs
and their NS records are stored in the
root servers to make it faster and more
complicated the DNS server that the
client a resolver talks to isn't some
sort of global master server resolvers
normally talked to a nearby caching dns
server for a home user that might be the
local home router or it might be run by
their ISP or it could be a well-known
DNS service like Google Public DNS when
that caching server receives a query
from a client
first it consults its local cache if the
cache doesn't know what the record is
the caching server recursively resolves
the query forwarding to the appropriate
name servers possibly first at the root
and then at the top-level domain and
then at the lower level domain until
eventually it gets back an answer then
it stores that result in its cache so it
doesn't have to run the same query over
and over again
every time you look up udacity.com or
google.com or whatever and finally it's
able to return that result to the client
but caching can cause problems if you
want to move your site from one IP
address to another like if you're moving
your website from Google to Amazon and
some DNS cache has the old address then
clients who use that cache will see the
old address instead of the new one to
cut down on this kind of thing DNS
records have a time to live or TTL which
tells caches how long to cache them for
for instance these records that I just
used dig to get for udacity.com
have a time to live of 60 seconds I look
them up from the cache later the time
livers reduced now it's down to 22
seconds and 14 and after the TTL expires
Cashin servers have to go back to the
authoritative server again look the
record up to make sure that their
information is fresh</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
