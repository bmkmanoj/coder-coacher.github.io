like the original state there could be
five moves to come out of this two of
the moves we can already say are illegal
moving two guards would have more
prisoners than guards on the left and
moving one guard and one prisoner would
end up with too many prisoners on the
right so we don't include those states
then our three legal moves are to move
one prisoner two prisoners or one guard
but now I notice that this state is
actually identical to this state like we
said before once we're in a state we
don't really care how we got there so
going back to an earlier state is not a
productive move so we can rule this out
as an unproductive move
similarly this state is the same as this
state so we can rule this out as an
unproductive move as well that leaves us
with only one legal productive move that
can follow from the previous state that
is a very good point David so this
representation is a good representation
for this problem because it is making
all the constraints of the
problem-solving explicit so that we can
quickly compare states and say which
moves are productive and move moves are
not productive I can tell you that when
I tried to solve this problem on my own
it took me a while because I didn't
recognize the fact that I kept going
around in a circle because I didn't
realize I kept coming back to the exact
same state in fact David most of us have
the same difficulty so the power of the
semantic network as a representation is
arising because it allows us to
systematically solve this problem
because it makes all the constraints all
the objects or the relationships all the
moves very explicit</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
