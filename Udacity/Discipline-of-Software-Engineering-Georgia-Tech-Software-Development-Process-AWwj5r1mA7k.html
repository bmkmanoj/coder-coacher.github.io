examples I'm sure that you have all
experienced software problems typically
manifested in what we call a crash and
that crash might happen while you are
finishing your homework or that
three-page long email that you were
preparing for the last two hours but why
is it so difficult to build the software
or better why is it so difficult to
build good software and how can we do it
this is exactly the topic of this class
and the reason why software engineering
is a fundamental discipline in computer
science to motivate that in this class
we will study a set of methodologies
techniques and tools that will help us
build the high quality software that
does what it's supposed to do and
therefore makes our customers happy and
that does it within the given time and
money constraints so within the budget
that it's allocated for the software
before jumping into today's often
engineering techniques though let me
take a step back and look at how we got
here as I believe it is very important
to have some historical perspective on
how this discipline was born and how it
was develop over the years</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
