here one is in general the fake data
pulls everything towards 0.5 so as we go
to extremes over here we are less
extreme in this case 0.33 is further
away from 0.5 than 0.4 so all these
numbers get move towards 0.5 so this is
somewhat smoother
we also see that these two outcomes the
first in the last on the divisional
model give us the same extreme estimate
but the more data we get in our new
estimator the more we are willing to
move away from 0.5 one observation of
heads give us 0.667
two of them 0.75 now I can promise you
in the limit as the only C heads for
infinitely many will finally approach 1
now this is really cool
we added fake data and I will tell you
that I generally think these are better
estimates in practice and the reason why
is it's really reckless after seeing a
coin flip to assume that all coins come
up positive I think it's much more
moderate to so well we already have some
evidence that heads may be more likely
but we night not quite convinced yet the
not quite convinced is the same as
having a prior there's an entire
literature that talks about these priors
they have a very cryptic name they
called dervish LED priors but more
importantly the method of adding fake
data is called a laplacian estimator
when there's plenty data that a + an
estimator gives about the same results
as the Maximizer estimator but when data
is scarce this works usually much much
much better than the maximum X estimator
it's a really important lesson in
statistics</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
