this concept so let's evaluate tit for
tat versus tit for tat spy versus spy
and ask whether or not they are sub-game
perfect or in a sub-game perfect
equilibrium with each other and your
choices are yes and no mm-hmm but if you
say no I'd like you to give me a
sequence to show that it is not sub-game
perfect in other words that if they were
to take this sequence of actions and
this one was to take this sequence of
actions it would leave the machines in a
position where they would not be willing
to follow through on their threat that
it would be better for them to do
something else in the long run assuming
that they're still playing against the
other tit-for-tat machine from that
point on yep just imagine that someone
could go in and change one thing would
you still want to follow tit for tat the
next time step or not yeah I don't know
that it has to be just one thing but
yeah that's right they've changed change
the sequence leading up to this point
and then say okay do you still want to
do what tit for tat is telling you to do
or would you rather do something else
right okay I think I got it cool all
right go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
