project we should be able to see our
intelligent environment which is the
split screen on the left we have our
project layout that shows our main
project folder named hello world so
let's expand this folder SRC is short
for source and that refers to the source
code or main code of our program so
let's expand this inside here you might
recognize our base package name and
inside that is something called main
main is something called a class and
you'll learn more about classes when we
talk about objects later but for now
know that all the code and functions you
right we'll be inside classes so main is
what we want to pay attention to and in
fact on the right side of our screen is
all the code contained in our main class
and there's this main function that I
mentioned before whenever you write a
program your computer needs to know
where to start running your code and by
default it will always start at this
main function so inside this function is
where you'll place all the lines of code
you want to execute like if you want to
print out a line of text you'll have to
call the print line function inside this
main function so for this program we
want to execute a line of code that
prints out hello world and we can do
that just by writing a simple print line
statement here we'll start by saying
system and you can see that just when I
type in the starting letters for system
IntelliJ helps me by suggesting the code
that I'm writing then i can write dot
out dot print line with IntelliJ helping
me every step of the way then inside
these parentheses I'll write the string
that I want to print out and that's just
hello world and let's save this by
pressing command s or save all and we
have one more thing to check before we
run this program let's click on this run
tab and go down to edit configurations
then this window pops up and you should
see for filled in fields the first is
our main class that we want to run which
is calm duck company main so this is
correct next is our working directory
which is just where our project has been
saved then we have the class path of our
module
and this just specifies the project
folder that our main class is in and
that's our project hello world intellij
should automatically select this for you
but if it doesn't just use this
drop-down menu to find it then it has
our Java Runtime environment and this
should say that we're using version 1.8
which is the version of Java that I
downloaded so this all looks good and
usually this information is filled in
automatically but it's always a good
idea to double check so we don't have to
change anything here I'll just click OK
and this will exit back to our program
we can run this in two ways by clicking
run main or by clicking this Run button
at the top right of our program and I'll
use this after we press run we can see
that a third window pops up at the
bottom of our screen this is called our
console and this is where all of our
print statements will print out so
running this program we see the expected
print output and whenever we write
system dot out dot print line in our
main method the lines will print out in
our console and the order that they're
called in our main function and you may
have noticed that we only had to run our
code and that's because IntelliJ
automatically compiles our code before
we run it and this makes it easier to
change code too so I can go into my code
and change this to hello Java and then
I'll save this again and press run and
in our console window we see our updated
text hello Java so IntelliJ is really
useful it does text highlighting
automatic code completion and lets you
change and run code really quickly and
easily so congrats on completing your
first hello world program in IntelliJ
I'd recommend adding on to this program
with a few lines of code of your own
maybe try adding two numbers and
printing out that value or displaying
any message of your own that's the best
way to get familiar with IntelliJ and
comfortable writing programs on your own
computer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
