the number of clicks for a URL for a
given keyword so when the URL is chosen
for that keyword and user clicks on it
now this is so that we have a measure of
the popularity of the URL and so the
search results can be ordered on that so
in order to do this we're going to have
to change the structure of our index so
that we have the count associated with
each URL and in order to do that we're
going to replace the URL with a list
which is URL count that means every time
we have the URL we need to replace it
with a list URL 0 because the count
initially will be 0 and so that changes
the structure what we haven't yet done
is taken into consideration the
duplicate elements and so we're going to
do something similar to the previous
question where you were asked to remove
duplicates from the index but this time
is going to be slightly different
because of this structure of URL count
so we're going to check we have the
keyword as before then when we have the
keyword we're going to loop through this
list here and we're going to check
whether each element in the list here
whether the first position in that is
our URL if it is then we're done we
don't want to add it again to the index
if it isn't there after we've looped
through all of the URLs then we'll add
it to the index as before so that takes
care of duplicates and the change in the
structure of the index what we need to
now do is to sort out the clicks so to
do this we're going to look up in the
index to find our keyword and that's
going to give us all the associated URLs
if we've got some URLs well if we
haven't got any URLs and there's nothing
to do we're not going to be able to
click on anything so if we have got some
URLs if the first position is our
URL but we're looking for remember that
look at one now return this whole list
of URL camp pairs so we're going to have
to just look at the URL the first entry
to see if it matches rather than the
whole list and if it does match then
we're going to increment the count which
is the second position by one and that's
it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
