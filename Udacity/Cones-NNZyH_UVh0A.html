high magnification probably elect Ron
micrograph than pseudo color of your
retina and you can see that retina is
made up of two kinds of receptors called
rods and cones and we'll talk more about
the differences between them when we do
the human anatomy conversation but today
all we're going to do is we're going to
talk about cones and in particular there
several million cones in the retina they
tend to be focused more or group more in
the near the fovea the middle they're
responsible for the high-resolution
imagery that is your ability to see very
sort of a good resolution at the center
of your visual field and most
importantly for today's conversation
it's your cones that discriminate color
that is that they're sensitive to
different wavelengths and your your
visual system uses the outputs of the
cones process through a variety of
channels to see color in particular
there are three types of cones that are
called red green and blue that's not
really quite correct you'll see why in a
minute they really should be called long
medium and short and you also see as is
written here that the vast majority of
them are red and green and a very small
percentage of them are blue all right so
this is a graph of the sensitivity of
each of these three types of cones
roughly red green and blue in terms of
how responsive they are as a function of
a single band of wavelengths of light so
here you see the wavelength of the light
expressed in nanometers and you can see
that there's one channel right here that
starts at the longer range and Peaks
somewhere around there and then there's
another one that's called green even
though it's really just offset a little
bit from that and then finally what's
called the blue which is really the
short wavelength cone if you were to
make a picture of sort of the retinal
mosaic and you colored the cones what
you see would be a picture that looks
kind of like this you'll notice that in
the middle there's hardly any blue cones
at all and there's some more of them out
here all right but basically almost all
of the
cones that are used are in the red and
green and the blue is really just there
for a little bit of coverage and yet we
see color very very well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
