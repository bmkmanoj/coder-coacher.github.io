internet routing that is what hops a
packet will take to get from one end
points to the other let's say a Georgia
Tech student is curious about what is
going on at the MIT Media Lab of course
there is no direct link so data is going
to have to take several intermediate
hops the essential data structure here
is a routing table that translates the
IP address to the next top ie the
address the packet should be sent to
next every node and the internet should
have a different routing table there is
much that is interesting and the
shortest path like algorithms used to
figure out what the next hop should be
and also in the implementation of the
routing table should it be a hash table
a try etc here however I want to address
the question of the size of the table in
a very uh naive approach the routing
table would require almost 2 to the 32
entries one for each IP address on the
internet fortunately this isn't
necessary because IPS are largely
allocated based on region similar IPS
will often take similar routes for
instance consider traffic between
Georgia Tech and MIT as mentioned
earlier MIT owes the 1800 slash eight
address space meaning that every IP that
starts with 18 needs to go to Boston and
the MIT campus all the traffic from
Georgia Tech to MIT will likely follow
the same first hop or two and only later
split in Boston there for Georgia Tech
routers don't need 16 million entries
for MIT one entry that matches anything
starting with 18 suffices all the
traffic will be collected up towards
Boston this principle can be applied
more broadly to keep the size of routing
tables manageable to see the routing
table on your machine run in net stat -
