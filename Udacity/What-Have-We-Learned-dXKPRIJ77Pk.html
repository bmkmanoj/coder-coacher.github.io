kind of done with this lesson those are
the three things that I wanted to
mention and I think we can now go back
to where you left off and talk about
what we have learned except I have the
pin and so if you have to tell me what
we've learned I don't have to tell you
this is true so now when you say the
three things what were the three things
that you talked about oh you're trying
to trick me into telling ya a little bit
alright so so alright so when I was when
I had the pen we talked about well two
main things well the overall topic is
this CCC which is a Comedy Central
Committee's no closed caption clowns no
so coordinating communicating and
coaching right ha I think what we learn
is that alliteration can be fun yeah
well sure and in particular i wanted i
talked about two particular models one
was the deck palm DP model mm-hmm which
at least let us define or ask questions
about what it means to coordinate and
communicate optimally when we've got
agents that don't share a brain but they
do share the reward function so it's
what's good for each one of them is good
for the community right shared are
distinct brains mm-hmm I like that then
we talked about the inverse
reinforcement learning idea which was
that we could actually use examples of
behavior demonstrations of behavior to
infer reward functions and then once we
have those reward functions we could try
to optimize them in other settings yep
we go from behaviors to rewards instead
of going from rewards to behavior and
that is what makes it in verse and
having those rewards means that it
generalizes to other settings as well
right and I think that a point that I
made on that when I started taking over
the pen was that this actually is a kind
of reward shaping by getting human
beings to give us hints about what we
ought to be doing okay but in the form
of behavior demonstrations but in the
form of behavior demonstration oh and
that is a nice little point where it's
pointing towards making which is
demonstration or one way to do coaching
were the other ways we did some coaching
so yeah demonstrations is when we do 20
and then there was this kind of policy
feedback or policy I guess you called it
policy shaping right but it was this
sort of idea that you can give feedback
on the actions being taken by the agent
and that can be incorporated
combined with other suggestions as well
as what the learner is picking up on its
own and so between reward shaping
demonstrations and policy shaping we got
a nice little set of ways that human
beings can communicate to agents so
let's see I know I did more than this
there was some examples that I use what
kind of examples did I use well the I
mean in the policy shaping setting we
talked about pac-man yeah so we learned
that pac-man is like the one example you
should use for everything sure except
for what we did at the end end which was
drama management right right we talked
about drama management and in particular
yeah in particular we introduced EDD
MVPs where TTD mdp has something to do
with trajectories and drama targets and
stuff that's exactly right and I think
we we had a nice little conversation or
tying some of these things back to the
things we did before we actually
returned and brought up again
constraints or as an options as a way of
doing coaching and communication and try
to really drive home the point that you
know there's some human beings and they
think a particular way and then there
are machines and they think a particular
way and we should try to move the
machines closer to the humans rather
than forcing the humans to come all the
way over to the machines yeah I like
that as a philosophy that's really what
i think is important yeah that's a good
philosophy well I think that covers
everything Michael nice may I feel
pretty good right there nice so does
this mean we're done I think this means
we're done with the class kind of oh
really so maybe we should do some kind
of wrap up to see how everything ties
together yeah let's do that that way I
don't have to say goodbye why don't you
come down to Atlanta and maybe we can
record some stuff together great i will
have done that perfect you or is that
perfect or is that the past perfect
pluperfect too perfect yeah it's the
pluperfect good pluperfect okay Michael
well I will see you in Atlanta soon bye
Charles bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
