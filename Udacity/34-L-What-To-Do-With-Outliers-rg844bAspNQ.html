outliers the thing we need to do as
stated earlier is check out the outlier
values to see if it's likely that the
data are incorrect for example in our
last sample data if the age and one of
the observations was 299 then we would
be justified in deciding that this was
some sort of reporting or entry error
possibly the correct age was 29 and an
extra nine was added or maybe the way
really was a 99 year old student
attending Community College and someone
mistakenly put a two in front of the
correct value the best course of action
in this case is to try to go back to the
original source to determine the correct
data but if that's not possible then the
best thing to do is to delete the record
from the data set so what if we don't
have an obvious error and we aren't
certain whether the data is accurate or
not if we have a situation such as the
two instances above where it could be
correct but it's just abnormal then the
analysis and modeling process should
include that data that said it is
legitimate to create models without the
data as well to compare results but it
should be noted which models do and
don't contain the outliers since we're
talking about business analysis someone
within the business will need to make a
decision as to which model to work with
but what shouldn't happen is to just
drop the outlying observations just
because it'll be easier to work with on
the other hand if like in our first
example the outlier didn't really change
the results we're in our example the
regression line retained its original
slope then it can be legitimate to
remove that observation another way that
analysts can work with outliers is
called truncation this is an instance
for example where we know that a certain
value can only be below a given maximum
and yet a value is reported above that
it might make sense to keep the
observation and just truncate the value
down to the maximum
an example of this might be if we were
analyzing training effective s for a
classroom and we knew that the class
could hold only a certain number of
students say 20 and yet an observation
reported 40 here it might make sense to
change the value to 20 rather than
eliminate the observation entirely but
keep in mind anytime those types of
decisions are made we should make sure
it is noted in the report of the process</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
