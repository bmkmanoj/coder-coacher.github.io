we're going to look back now through
lesson 17 through 26 and the material
we've covered during that time let's get
started we began by developing an
understanding of functions we asked the
question what is a function as you
learned a function pairs each input
value with exactly one output value
which means we can figure out if a graph
represents a function by using the
vertical line test we then looked at
domain and range as well as explored
what it means for a function to be
either even or odd from there we
investigated the overall shape of a
function going all the way from minus
infinity to infinity in the domain
looking at whether it's increasing or
decreasing and whether it has maximum
and minimum points this led to a
discussion about finding real zeros
which as you remember are the x
coordinates of a graphs x-intercepts and
we used a polynomial long division to
help us along the way to help us narrow
down the list of possible rational zeros
for a polynomial function we use the
rational zero theorem when we couldn't
find the exact values of zeros that we
could see on graphs the intermediate
value theorem helped us approximate
their locations with piecewise functions
we got to put together some really
interesting graphs and start thinking
more about domain and range this
prepared us to work with rational
functions whose vertical horizontal and
slant asymptotes restrict their domains
and ranges in particular ways lastly we
explored transformations of functions
rigid transformations include vertical
and horizontal shifts as well as
reflections in the X and Y axis
non-rigid transformations on the other
hand distort the shape of functions by
stretching or shrinking them we
encourage you to review the practice
problems at the end of each lesson the
problem sets and the summary review
videos best of luck to you we know
you'll do well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
