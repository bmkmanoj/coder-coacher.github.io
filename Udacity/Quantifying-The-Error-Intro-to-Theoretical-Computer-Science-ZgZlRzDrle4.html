solution contains at most n objects
simply because there's no more than n
objects in the input itself so it's
almost a very coarse estimate but it'll
do for us so due to the rounding we may
introduce some errors so the algorithm
when working with the rounded objects
might tell you that it's best thing to
take this object here this object here
this object here and the subject here
for example but instead it could have
been better to actually take this one
here instead of that one here or this
object here instead of this object and
so on well some some might also be the
same but sometimes we might make
mistakes by just taking the wrong
objects so we know that these kind of
mistakes can only be made if the value
of a divided by X round it down is the
same as the value of B divided by X
rounded down some mistakes of this kind
taking the wrong object can only be made
if to the algorithm object a value wise
looks the same to the algorithm as
object B value wise which means that the
value of a so the original value divided
by X round it down is the same as the
value of B divided by X rounded down but
that actually allows us to quantify a
mistake
so mistakes can only be made of this
condition here is fulfilled now the
amount of value lost in each mistake
that we make is of course the value of
the object B which is the more valuable
object we should have taken minus the
value of object a and now my question to
you and this is of course a bit
challenging is what is the maximum
difference in value that actually
objects B and a can have and the way to
figure this out is to look at this
condition because the mistake is only
made of this year is fulfilled so what I
would like you to figure out is what is
the maximum difference in value between
the objects B and a and please enter
your answer here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
