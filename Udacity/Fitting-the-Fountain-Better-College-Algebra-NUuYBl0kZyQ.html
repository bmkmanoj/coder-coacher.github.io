from our work earlier on in the lesson
we got complex numbers as our roots now
looking at where the vertex of our
parabola is below the x-axis and the
fact that the parabola is pointing
downward this curve doesn't really fit
the situation that we're interested in
remember that why here in this equation
and in this graph is the vertical
displacement from the ground of the
water and X is the horizontal
displacement of the water right now the
waters underground and that's not really
what's grants looking for in terms of
decorations so what do you think is
wrong with grants equation and his graph
right now there's one single thing that
we can do to this graph that would fix
the entire problem that we're having the
Miss location of the horizontal and
vertical coordinates of the water in
grants fountain so what one step should
we do to this graph to make it better
describe that fountains shape should we
flip this parabola upside down should we
translate it up translate it down make
it wider make it skinnier translate it
to the right translate it to the left or
just leave it alone altogether</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
