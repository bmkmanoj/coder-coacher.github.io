it turns out that there is no tweak that
you could do to these algorithms to make
the trifecta to have all three of these
properties and in fact there is no
clustering algorithm it is impossible to
derive a clustering algorithm that has
these three properties so this was
proven by by Kleinberg and what he
showed is that once you define these
three different properties richness
scale invariance and consistency they
are mutually contradictory in a sense so
just like we saw in the example that we
went through in the quiz where we
tweaked the algorithm and it gets us one
but it loses us another that's a
necessary property you just can't have
all these three hold at once that's
really surprising coming from Kleinberg
because John is one of the nicest people
I know in machine learning in theory and
you would think that he would have tried
to find a possibility theorem added
impossibility there I'm very
disappointed he's got a dark side is
what I'm saying
this is a striking and maybe even
upsetting result right it's saying that
you know if you actually sit down and
say well here's what I would like my
clustering algorithm to be which people
hadn't really done very often once
you've bothered to go do all that hard
work of saying what matters to you and
what doesn't matter to you it turns out
you can't have what you want you can't
always have what you want
but can you get what you need in this
particular case maybe it depends if you
only feed too well so how bad is this
also so I agree it is it is a least to
me surprising result that you can't have
all three of them and it's a little
disappointing because you would love to
have an algorithm that does because I
think we agree all three of these
properties make sense at least certainly
and apparently to do but just how bad is
it I mean when you can't have all three
can you come close to having all three
can you have like 2.9 of them you can
have two of them because that's what we
did in the quiz hmm well it kind of
depends on what you can reinterpret some
of these properties and get and nearly
satisfy them and I can point you to
climb Burke's paper to look into that
but I think I need to be done with this
for now I just wanted to give you a
flavor of the idea that one of the
reasons that clustering is kind of hard
to pin down is because when you pin it
down it plays dead mmm it's like it's
like an opossum when you pin it down it
actually it turns out that it still
doesn't really want to do what you want
it to do but in practice what happens is
people do clustering for lots of
different reasons and they're willing
to change their clustering like look at
what actually comes out of it and
changing that change their notion of
clustering so that it's more consistent
with what they're trying to achieve it's
not great to use in this purely
automated fashion where you just hand it
over to the computer and be done with it
but it's still a really powerful thing
to do to get to know your data better
okay I accept that I feel better now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
