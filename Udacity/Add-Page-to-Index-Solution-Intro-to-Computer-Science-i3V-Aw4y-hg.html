index we're defining a procedure it
takes in three inputs to index the URL
and the content at that location we use
the split method to divide the content
into its component words we store that
in the words variable then what we want
to do is go through all the words adding
each word to the index we can do that
using a for loop so we're going through
the words we'll use word as our variable
and for each word we call add to index
passing in the index the word and the
URL note that if a word occurs more than
once on the same page we're gonna keep
adding it to the index each time so
there might be more than one occurrence
of the same URL in the list of URLs
associated with the word depending on
what we want our searching to do and how
we're gonna decide how to respond to
queries this might be a good thing or a
bad thing we'll talk more about that in
a later class so let's try this in the
Python interpreter so let's recap the
code we already wrote we have the add to
index procedure that takes in the index
a keyword in a URL it goes through the
entries in index and it appends the URL
to the entry that matches the keyword if
it's not found it adds a new entry to
the index that's the list of the keyword
and the single URL we define the lookup
procedure that takes the index in the
keyword finds the entry in the next that
corresponds to that keyword and returns
the URLs associated with that keyword so
now we're going to define the add page
to index procedure so here it is we're
splitting the content into its component
words we're looping through the words
and we're adding each word to the index
note that we don't need to return
anything the point of this procedure is
to modify the index so let's try add
page the index with a few simple
examples so here we have the test we
tried before let's see that we get the
expected result so after adding the
first quote to the index we see that
there are the four words in the quote
each has the list of pages associated
with it the list of URLs contains fake
tests then we added the second page the
second print we see now we have for most
of the words we have both fake tests and
not the test except for not which only
has not test so to be
this works let's try a few more
interesting examples so now we're gonna
add the page to index that might be on
the Dilbert comm page this quote from
Scott Adams about time management
another strategy is to nor the fact that
you're slowly killing yourself by not
sleeping and exercising enough that
frees up several hours a day the only
downside is that you get fat and die
hopefully that's not happening to anyone
in this class I know that's a lot of
work but you need to manage your time so
you're still getting enough sleep and
exercise the second quote we'll add to
the page index and we'll give the URL
Randy Pausch for that and it's a quote
that says good judgment comes from
experience experience comes from bad
judgment if things aren't going well it
probably means you're learning a lot and
things will go better later so hopefully
things are going well in this class but
if they're not that means you're
learning a lot and hopefully things will
go better later let's see what the index
looks like after adding these two pages
so we see it's pretty big there are a
lot of words in those two quotes we can
see that some of them only appear at
Dilbert calm in the quote from Scott
Adams on time management others appear
at both pages we'll see more if we try a
query let's try a query we'll look up in
our index to see where the word u
appears and when we run that we see it
appears in both documents it was there
in the Dilbert quote twice so it is
listed two times at the URL dear bro
calm and once at the Randy Pausch URL
just to confirm the two occurrences in
this quote there's one here and there's
one here and there's one in the second
quote right here if we look up another
word we see that good did not occur in
any of the quotes but bad occurred in
the second one so it looks like all the
code that we have seems to be working we
can look up words in our index and get
the list of URLs where they were found
we can add pages to our index and we can
record all the words in that page at the
location they occur we're really close
to having a search engine the one thing
that we have left to do is to connect
the code we wrote for crawling the web
to the code that we have for indexing
documents and looking up the keywords so
it's been a while since we looked at the
code for crawling the web so
let's look at that again and see if we
can think how to connect the two</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
