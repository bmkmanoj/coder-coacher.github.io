fragments except for the third one
except for this one
leave the value of P unchanged so let's
work through why that is we're not going
to assume anything about P it's some
list with at least two elements so I'll
draw P we can't make any assumptions
about what the elements are we'll call
them alpha beta and gamma actually it
looks like alpha beta and alpha that's
okay
so now let's look at the first option
here's what happens we append a 3 to P
that adds a new element at the end of P
and then we pop that removes it we don't
do anything with the result returned by
pop but that's okay the value of P is
unchanged for this choice we start by
popping that will remove an element from
P so now X will refer to whatever this
element was so X refers to alpha in this
case and P is mutated by mod removing
that element so at this stage the value
of P has changed but we're not done we
still have the pen to do the pen appends
to P adding on to the end of P the value
that X refers to which is the alpha
value that was in that position to begin
with so at the end of these two steps
the value of P is also unchanged let's
look at the third option and see why
that does affect the value of P so the
first statement we assigned to X the
result of P dot pop that will remove the
last element from P and make X refer
tips value so now whatever value was at
the end of P the name X for first two
then we do another pop so now after this
patan Y will refer to the value here
which is beta we remove that value from
P so at this stage P has lost two
elements but we've stored them in the
variables x and y then we do that pen
and we're doing the pens in the same
order we did the Pops so we're appending
X first the value of x is alpha so this
will add the alpha to P note that that's
not what we started with we started with
the beta there then we do the next
append
that will add the value of y which is
beta to P if we pop elements of P and we
add them in the same order that we pop
them this will actually reverse the
order of the elements since each time we
append we add to the end of the list so
for the final choice we're again popping
two elements this time we're appending
in the opposite order that means when we
do that pen so the value when we popped
X that got the value alpha when we pop Y
why was the value beta P lost these two
elements as the result of the two pops
now we're here we do the pendants and
this time we're appending Y first well
that's the beta that's the last one we
popped the first one we append this gets
the elements in the order they were
before
and finally we append X which is the
Alpha this restores the value of P to
what we started with</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
