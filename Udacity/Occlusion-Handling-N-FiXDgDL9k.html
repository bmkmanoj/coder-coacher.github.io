group and others pushed on a little bit
more recent of handling occlusion so the
question is you know if a thing gets
partially occluded we have this problem
because remember the eigen face stuff is
it's capturing the entire image as a
vector and all the pixels all the
components in that vector are created
equal so if some of them are sort of
being blocked or obscured it's not gonna
be able to explain that data it's 9 bit
of track give you a very high
probability at that area but it turns
out you can you can address that if you
think about the following right that by
the way that's Greg Dudek a while back
hi Greg
picture there when I reproduce an image
so let's suppose I've tracked this thing
I've computed my again basis and now I'm
I'm trying to find my best one and I do
I can now say of all those pixels which
ones am i reconstructing well the ones
that I'm reconstructing well those are
the ones that I have a lot more
confidence on so let me create a weight
mask that says you know those pixels are
fine but anywhere that I find something
that I can't reconstruct well I'm gonna
highlight those pixels as ones that I'm
not gonna pay attention to by the way
the reason I'm saying highlighted is on
the video I'm about to show you for
whatever reason they have sort of bad
pixels as being bright so you can think
of them as being highlighted for not
counting as much in the current or the
next iteration so what you're gonna see
here in this video again is so here's
the Greg's face that's gonna be tracked
and this is the sort of the location of
what they're doing but what you'll see
here is there'll be this black image and
then all of a sudden you'll see his
hands swipe up across his face now of
course his hand is not easily reproduced
with the face I can basis so you're
gonna see that light up and that's it's
saying ok the weight of those pixels
should be reduced so let's see if this
works
ah there it goes it's playing ok same
thing we see before you see his
eigenvectors changing on the bottom as
he rotates in and out of plane whoops
there was his hand did you miss that
let's go back again now
ready in a minute he's gonna swipe his
hand over and say is there there it goes
did you see that you can play it
backwards as his hand came up the
weights got brighter where the hand was
saying ignore this this place and now it
tracks him for a while he's smiling he's
getting a large moving around and you
can see it's doing good job tracking you
can see the difference between how well
it can be reconstructed and the the
reason it can handle things like this is
remember the state that it's tracking is
position translation rotation scale so
you can normalize it back to the
original sort of canonical view and
explain that view from the eigen basis
alright so that's some pretty cool
tracking work</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
