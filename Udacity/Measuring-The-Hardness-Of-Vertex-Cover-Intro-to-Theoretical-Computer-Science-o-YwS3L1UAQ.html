solve vertex cover using a search tree
so we start out with the original graph
and I'm now going to use again the
search tree where we branched into only
three different possibilities we know
it's not the best possible one but it
will be easier to understand the rest
this way but it also works for the more
complicated search trees so then on the
next level we again branched into three
different possibilities on each level
and so on and we said that the search
tree had a size of n half and the total
number of solutions that we looked at in
the search tree was three to the power
of in half which as you remember was
about 1.7 3 4 to the power of n now I
would like you to quickly think about
the following so as you remember at each
level of the search tree we're looking
at an edge where the two endpoints have
not yet had an assignment and we're
branching into three cases this one this
one and this one so now it's a very easy
quiz actually so how many words is is
are added each time we go one level
deeper into the tree at least one at
least to exactly one exactly two or is
this something that actually depends on
the structure of the input graph</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
