simply by just replacing this equation
with something that says for all state
and action the value of the state is
bigger than or equal to this expression
this is essentially the q value the you
know for each essay this is the Q value
essay so that's good now and now what we
have to add that min thing so what do we
minimize here be so we can't just
minimize fee like that because that's a
vector right and we can't just minimize
V sub s because s is unbound here right
it's like which s which has to we want
to minimize so we kind of want to
minimize all of them somehow so the way
we're going to write that and it turns
out to work is minimize the sum so
that's going to put pressure on all the
individual v's to be as small as they
can be so that it actually equals the
max isn't just an upper bound on the max
right because if any one of them isn't
then you don't have the minimum so right
then you can always move it down a
little bit right so this actually is a
linear program that is the solution to
which is equivalent to the solution to
the MDP so we can just write down this
linear program give it to a linear
program solver that runs in polynomial
time and boom we get our values V sub s
how do we get our policy from that we
just choose the action that always an
expectation gives you the best value
just sort of one step lookit yeah we
choose the greedy policy with respect to
that optimal value function so this is
cool this is sometimes called the primal
you know I guess because it's lives out
in the woods representation of the
linear program for solving MVPs and this
is perfectly reasonable this is very
actually very useful from a theoretical
perspective I haven't seen too many
people really use linear programming to
solve mdps it's got some overhead
associated with it that seems to make it
a little bit difficult to get it to run
competitively with the other algorithms
but it's it's okay especially if you
have a really good linear programming
package and if you happen to have other
kinds of linear constraints that you
need to throw in this is a very
convenient way of solving slightly more
difficult problems MVP's plus a little
bit of extra constraint so does that
make sense to you good with that yeah
I'm good with the all right I want to
say one more thing about linear
programming by switching away from the
primal to what's called the dual so
linear programming has this nice
property
that you can actually any linear program
you can change the constraints in two
variables and the variables into
constraints and you get a new linear
program that's equivalent to the old one
so this is just true in general for
linear programming is that it's linear
programming duality and sometimes it's a
really useful way of actually solving
them and for putting putting bounds and
constraints on the solutions but in the
context of MVPs it actually does
something kind of cool so I want to show
you that okay is it going to be as cool
as what what happened when we did
support vector machines I don't remember
that we did the same thing we wrote down
a series of equations and we solved for
the dual nice so yes it'll be the same
amount of cool as that excellent
excellent I look forward to it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
