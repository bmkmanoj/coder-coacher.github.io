be studying in school so that they could
be prepared to contribute to this area
so I think getting ground is a computer
science and including the necessary
medical technologies treatment in my
tics and programming and so one is
important and also now they knowing
systems as important because there are
more sand lots of hidden power over a
modern computer systems such as final as
currency various levels of memory
hierarchy and so on which is something
that clearly doesn't capture very well
but you can get several orders of
magnitude improvement in the other is by
taking advantage of this I highly
recommend the easily Kleinberg book
called networks crowds and markets I
have the book jacket here you see it but
it was published by cambridge university
press in 2010 a free version of it is
available on the internet so you don't
have to buy it and again it's called
networks crowds and markets and it's a
great read um they went to great pains
to have very few Greek letters so
they're just trying to get the concept
to you it also at the end of every
chapter has like an advanced materials
so if you want to delve more into it and
have beautiful citations and lots and
lots of references but it's a great big
book knowledge of algorithms is good
looking at social networks in a
different way agent not just as a social
network but actually starting to look at
how the network the social networks
actually work there are papers that come
out very regularly and not you don't
need to go like Google Scholar you can
follow there's different industry
websites that keep track of social
networks like Mashable that you can
actually look at and they sometimes send
out very nice analysis posts on what's
actually going on and just keeping
yourself abreast of this will make it
more advantageous if you are
interviewing because you will be able to
actually speak like you know use the
right
and also will also get you to actually
appreciate the math and the science
behind the networks I think just
spending a certain amount of time
wasting time on the Internet is actually
really useful that's your time thank you
yeah this case it's wasting its good
waste yes good wasting</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
