class called movie now this class had
the following attributes the movie's
title its storyline a link to the movies
poster image and a link to its YouTube
trailer now in addition to these things
the class movie also had a function
called show trailer after we had defined
this class movie we created several
instances of this class instances like
Toy Story and avatar now further imagine
that we wanted to create another class
called
TV show I would think that this class
would have details like the title of the
show its season and episode number and
also the TV station that the show is
aired on additionally this class could
also have a function called get local
listings once we have created a class
called TV show we can create multiple
instances of this class instances like
season 1 episode 1 of Breaking Bad and
the final episode of Seinfeld all right
so if we continue our thought experiment
here we can further imagine that there
can be several items that both of these
classes can share amongst each other
things like title for sure
also things like duration of the movie
and duration of the TV show in minutes
so the best way to structure this code
would be to create another class called
video which would have two attributes
the videos title and the videos duration
and the class movie could inherit from
this class video to do this we would
have to add the class name video inside
these parentheses now this would mean
that class movie would inherit title and
duration from class video additionally
the class TV show could also inherit
from class video to do this we would
also have to add the class name video
inside these parentheses now this would
mean that class TV show would inherit
title and duration from class video now
you can clearly see how we can write a
piece of code in this case class video
and continue to reuse it in multiple
different places another big benefit of
writing code this way in addition to
just reusing code is
that it allows us to follow an intuitive
model of how things exist in our brain
so intuitively speaking we know what
videos are we also know what TV shows
and movies are so writing code in this
way allows programmers to map how things
exist in our brain onto code</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
