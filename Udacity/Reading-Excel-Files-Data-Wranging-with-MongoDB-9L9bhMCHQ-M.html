course let's take a look at the solution
to this Excel Rd exercise so here's our
parse file function and you can see that
what we've done here is use this column
slicing trick we've used the call values
method on sheet to pull out all of the
values in column 1 column 1 being the
coasts column within that data set then
we're simply using Max and min here on
this list that we've pulled out in order
to get the max Val and min Val in that
entire column we're using the index
method on lists to figure out where that
Max val is in the cv list now because
the data that we have actually begins on
row 1 of the spreadsheet rather than on
row 0 we've got to add a 1 here so that
within our spreadsheet we end up with
the right position for that value that
is to say the right row number okay
then what we're going to do here is for
the position or the row on which the max
value appears we're going to take the
value in column 0 that will give us the
max of time
okay and then what we're going to do is
turn that time which we'll get as a
floating point number into an actual
time tuple we'll do that same process
with the min value in generating our
data dictionary that we'll end up
returning from this function we can
simply plug in the real time Max Val
real min time and min Val and then to
get the average we're simply going to
calculate it right here and make it the
value of this key average Coast okay
let's run this I just want to point out
that I'm using the P print module here
so that we get our data printed out in a
nicely structured way and we can see
that we get good values here and if you
take a look in the spreadsheet itself
and do something like sort the
spreadsheet you'll see that the maximum
in x and the maximum in values are
calculated correctly one thing I want to
note is that in our assertion here we're
doing a rounding so that we don't have
any issues with floating point values
being slightly off as we get further and
further to the right of the decimal
point</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
