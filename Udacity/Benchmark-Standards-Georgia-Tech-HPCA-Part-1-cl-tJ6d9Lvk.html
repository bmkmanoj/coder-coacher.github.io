computer manufacturers so usually there
are standards organizations that put
together benchmark Suites for use in
comparing performance between machines
so usually there is a benchmarking
organization that takes input from
manufacturers of systems from user
groups from experts in academia and so
on and produces a standard benchmark
suite along with instructions on how to
produce representative measurements so
this is how we got TPC benchmarks which
are used for databases web servers data
mining and other transaction processing
so-called embassy benchmarks which are
used in embedded processing such as cars
video players printers phones etc so if
we're testing a processor for for
example potential using a car we would
use the embassy benchmarks not a TPC
and the spec benchmarks which are
typically used to evaluate engineering
workstations and also raw processors
because these benchmarks unlike the
other two are not very i/o intensive
they're mostly processor oriented so the
spec benchmark suite includes a number
of applications such as GCC which
represents software development were
close like a compiler several
applications like B waves and LBM
that a representative of fluid dynamics
workloads Perl which is representative
of string processing applications
catus ADM this is a physics simulation
related to relativity this is a person
for XML several service of differential
equations
be it a compression application to game
AI applications and so on as you can see
the spec benchmarks are really try to
cover a variety of potential uses for
processors and high-performance systems</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
