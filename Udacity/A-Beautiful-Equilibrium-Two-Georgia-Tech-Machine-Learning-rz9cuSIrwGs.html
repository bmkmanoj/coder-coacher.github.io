that come out of all of this work on
Nash equilibrium they're all on the
screen in front of you I'll read them
for you just in case you can't read my
handwriting or if there's some typos
that you discover there forces me to
erase some words and then write some new
ones okay are you ready all right the
first one is in the end player pure
strategy game if elimination of all the
strictly dominated strategies eliminates
all but one combination of strategies
then that combination is in fact the
unique Nash equilibrium so that's that's
what happened in prisoner's dilemma we
got rid of all but one option and that
option had to be the unique Nash
equilibrium you say eliminate all of
them do we is it possible that things
that we couldn't eliminate and one round
we could eliminate in the next round
yeah it's possible so in fact this is
done in an iterated fashion you get rid
of whatever you can eliminate and
pretend they were never there because
the truth is no one would ever choose
them and then what you have left you
just do it again so it is possible
although not any examples that we did
okay the second one is and this both of
these I think are kind of obvious they
sort of make sense anyway at least to me
that any Nash equilibrium will survive
the iterated elimination of strictly
dominated strategies in other words if
you get rid of things that are strictly
dominated you will not accidentally get
rid of Nash equilibria in the process
and that makes sense because if they're
strictly dominated then if you ever end
up there you would want to leave and
therefore it can't be a Nash and
therefore can't be a Nash equilibrium
that's right so those two things sort of
make sense I think the last one is true
but isn't at least painfully obvious at
least not to me and that is if n is
finite that is you have a finite number
of players and for each of the set of
strategies that set of strategies is
also finite in other words you're still
in a finite game then there exists at
least one Nash equilibrium which might
involve two mixed strategies so you're
saying there's always a Nash equilibrium
yes possibly mixed for any finite game
so when you said I relaxed everything I
didn't actually relax the requirement
that it be a finite game fair enough but
you stopped writing finite so it's sort
of the same thing yeah I agree because
why would you play an infinite game
I don't maybe you got a lot of time on
your hands mm-hmm that would be like an
infinite dressed
okay so those are the the main results
here so what do we learn what we've
learned is that with interesting games
we end up in these weird situations
where we have to figure out how to solve
the game and one really nice concept is
this notion of an equilibrium and in
particular the notion of a Nash
equilibrium cool there you go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
