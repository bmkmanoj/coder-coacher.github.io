not someone for a specific task I didn't
do any programming skills tests or any
other things like that that you can
really quantify the result I gave a few
companies the same exact project that I
had the ability to to evaluate myself it
was a reporting project I wanted them to
connect all kinds of data sources one
dashboard and I told them that's what I
need that's the brief go out and execute
it you have one hundred dollars to do it
do whatever you need because one of the
things that was important to me is to
have also product abilities and not just
following orders it's also to envision
what you want what what I need them to
do and execute on that because I didn't
want to micromanage them I can't
micromanage so that was a test that he
passed in flying colors it was way
better than what I would do and then I
know okay we're going to walk together
for a long time because this is exactly
what I would expect an employee of mine
to do better than what i would do to be
better at things than i did this that's
why I need you I don't need you just
follow orders need you to think i need
you two to innovate and that was the
test</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
