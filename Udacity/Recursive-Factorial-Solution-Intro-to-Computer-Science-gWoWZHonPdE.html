and we should go back to our
mathematical definition that's what we
want to turn into code we had our base
case where factorial is 0 the result
should be 1 and we had a recursive case
where there was the input is greater
than 0 we want to have the result the
end times factorial of n minus 1 so we
can turn that fairly straightforwardly
into code so here's the code we're going
to define a procedure just like the
previous definition we have 1 input it's
a number we'll call it n now we need to
have the code so we need to first check
if we've reached the base case so we'll
use an if for that and we're going to
check if if n is equal to 0 remember we
need the double equals for the
comparison that means we've reached the
base case and we defined the value of
factorial of 0 is defined as 1 so that
means when N equals 0 what we should do
is return the value 1 when n is not
equal to 0 we'll use else for the case
where n is not equal to 0 well then we
have the recursive case and that was
given by the definition that the
factorial of n for numbers greater than
0 is equal to n times factorial of n
minus 1 so that's exactly what we want
to do in the Python code we'll return
the new result which is n times the
result we get calling factorial passing
in n minus 1 and this may seem strange
that we're defining factorial using
factorial it seems like that's kind of
circular but the reason that it's not
circular is because we have this base
case that we have a case where we do
stop we stop once we reach the case
where n is equal to 0 and because every
time we call factorial instead of
passing in the same value of n that we
started with we're passing in n minus 1
it's getting smaller eventually we're
going to get to 0 assuming that we
started with n as some positive whole
number so we eventually stop return 1
and on the way there we're going to be
multiplying in all these values so let's
step through
what happens when we run this code so
let's look at an example suppose we
called factorial passing in 3 so that
means we're going to enter the procedure
here the value that n refers to is going
to be 3 inside the body of factorial
we're gonna try the comparison and is
not equal to 0 so we don't return one so
we're going to go to the else and that
means we're going to return the value of
n times factorial of n minus 1 so that
means we're computing the value of n
times factorial then and n minus 1 will
Animus 3 so n minus 1 is 2 that's what
happened as a result of the first call
but we're not done right we still need
to evaluate this so now we're evaluating
factorial of 2 that means we're entering
factorial again this time of the value
of n will refer to 2 we do the
comparison and is not equal to 0 so we
go to the else clause now we're going to
return the result of n times factorial n
minus 1 in this case the value of n is 2
so the value of factorial of 2 will be 2
times the result we get by calling
factorial passing in the value of n
minus 1 so calling factorial passing in
1 and remember that was part of the
return where we had 3 times factorial 2
so we still have the 3 times but now
we're getting the result of factorial 2
it's 2 times something we're calling
factorial again we still don't know what
factorial of 1 is so that means we're
going to re-enter factorial we finished
here we're doing the call we're going to
re-enter factorial but this time the
value of n now refers to 1 and now again
this test is false so we go to the else
clause and now we're going to return n
which is 1 times the result of factorial
0 so now we're calling factorial 0 we're
going back into the procedure now the
value of N refers to is 0 and now this
test is actually true N equals 0 so
we'll go to the return here we return 1
that means the result of factorial 0 is
1 so to get the result of factorial 1 we
had
times factorial 0 that's 1 times 1 which
is 1 and now to get the result back from
factorial 2 we had 2 times factorial 1
which we now know as 1 so we're going to
have the result here as 2 and to get the
result from factorial 3 we have 3 times
factorial 2 which we now has the value 2
we'll get the result is 6 and note the
way we've defined it well if we tried
instead factorial 4 if we started with
factorial 4 what would have happened is
the first time we go through we get 4
times factorial 3 so factorial 4 would
be 4 times factorial 3 well we had fact
well 3 is 6 4 times 6 would give us 24
which the result of factorial 4</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
