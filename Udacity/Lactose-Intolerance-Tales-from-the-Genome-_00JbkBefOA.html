transcribing or translating her gene as
an adult even though she could as a
child this would result in a decrease
lactase activity but increase lactose
intolerant symptoms exactly the reason
it's not likely that she actually has a
mutation or an allele of the lactase
gene that doesn't work or is
non-functional it's because we know she
could digest lactose products as a baby
if she had a lactase gene that didn't
work at all then she would also not have
been able to drink milk as a baby which
would have been problematic in general
so the fact that she could drink milk as
a baby means that it's most likely that
she has a functioning lactase gene but
it's just turned off as an adult</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
