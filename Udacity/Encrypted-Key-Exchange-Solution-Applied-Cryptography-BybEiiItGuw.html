true so the first answer is not true in
fact the UK protocol is designed
primarily with this goal of not being
vulnerable to offline dictionary attacks
and the reason for that is if you look
at the two messages that are sent the
value that's encrypted with the password
is the result of a diffie-hellman
exchange if we believe the
diffie-hellman assumption that's
indistinguishable from random an
attacker who intercepts these messages
could try all possible passwords in the
dictionary even if one of those is
correct
the attacker couldn't tell which the
attacker obtains the encrypted messages
which are these diffie-hellman
Exponential's from those there's no way
to obtain the key so there's no way to
know if the guess was correct and it
should be indistinguishable from any
other guests so that's a good property
it also satisfies this other property
that it is actually not vulnerable to
the medon and they'll attack that
diffie-hellman was vulnerable too
because in this case if the attacker
tries to relay something without knowing
the password that will lead to some
other key being computed not known to
the attacker and the attacker won't be
able to set up the middle attack the
main drawback of this protocol is it
does require this server to keep the
password in order to decrypt this
message encrypted with the password the
server needs to use the password to do
decryption so this means the server
would need to store all the passwords in
clear-text this is highly undesirable if
the server was compromised all the
passwords would be lost</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
