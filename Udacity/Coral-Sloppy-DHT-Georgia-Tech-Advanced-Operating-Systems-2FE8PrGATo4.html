are available in their coral for
manipulating the sloppy DHT in
particular the put and get operation the
primitives are exactly the same it is
just that the semantics of the put and
get a very different in terms of how it
is actually implemented so put takes on
two parameters key and value key is the
content hash and value is a node ID of
the proxy with the content for the
particular key essentially this put is
announcing the willingness of the proxy
to serve the content whose signature is
key the put can be initiated by the
origin server with new content or it
could also be initiated by a node that
just downloaded the content and wants to
serve as a proxy to reduce the load of
the origin server in both cases they
will want to do a put operation and the
result of doing the put operation is to
store this key value in some metadata
server that is some known that is going
to serve as a name server that can
answer queries coming in saying I am
looking for this key in that case that
metadata server can return the value
associated with that key so what we need
to do when we do a put operation is to
place this key value in an appropriate
node now what do we mean by an
appropriate node ideally what we want to
do is given a key we want to store it in
a node ID whose ID is n equal to ki
that's the desired node where we want to
place it but we want to do this without
really causing a metadata server
overload now how do we determine if a
particular node is overloaded well what
we're going to do is define two states
one state is called a full state and
what that is saying is a particular node
let's say no Dan
is already storing values for a key
remember what I said earlier this key
value pair can be placed by either the
origin server that is creating the
content or it could be placed by proxy
who's saying I'm willing to serve as a
proxy for the content so there could be
lots of nodes that have the content and
are willing to serve the content all of
them would have done put operation so
the lord that matches exactly the key
that is being put may already have quite
a few candidates that are willing to
serve as the content providers for that
particular key that's this parameter
full that's saying I'm willing to host
up to l entries for this key value pair
anything more than that I'm not going to
do that I'll get overloaded so the full
is a condition you can say it's a
spatial condition that's saying I'm
willing to to entertain up to L content
providers for a particular key K the
second way a particular node may get
overloaded is if it actually starts
getting a large number of requests for a
particular key so this is a time metric
that says a node has a beta parameter
and the beta parameter is the number of
requests per unit time that a node is
entertaining so if it says that I'm
already entertaining beta requests for
this particular key and therefore if you
want me to store the same key I'm going
to say no I cannot do it because I'll
get overloaded so this is a space metric
that's saying how many values I'm
willing to store for a particular key
loaded is stating how many requests per
unit time I am willing to entertain for
a particular key those are the two
matrix we're going to use in determining
whether to place a key value pair at a
particular destination node</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
