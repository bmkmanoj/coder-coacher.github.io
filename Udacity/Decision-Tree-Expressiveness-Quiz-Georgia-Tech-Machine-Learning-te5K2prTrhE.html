exercise showed is that X or in X or
parity is hard it's exponential but that
kind of provides us a little bit of a
hint right we know that X or is hard and
we know that or is easy at least in
terms of the number of nodes you need
right but we don't know going in what a
particular function is so we never know
whether the decision tree that we're
going to have to build is going to be
easy one that is something linear say or
a hard one something that's exponential
so this brings me to a key question that
I want to ask which is exactly how
expressive is a decision tree and this
is what I really mean by this not just
what kind of functions can it represent
but if we're going to be searching over
all possible decision trees in order to
find the right one how many decision
trees do we have to worry about to look
at so let's go back and look at take the
X or case again and just speak more
generally let's imagine that we once
again have n attributes here's my
question to you Michael
how many decision trees are there and
look I'm going to make it easy for you
Michael
they're not just attributes they're
boolean attributes Thanks okay and
they're not just boolean attributes but
the output is also boolean got it sure
but how many trees so it's I'm gonna go
with a lot okay a lot to find a lot
define a lot so all right well there's n
choices for which no to split on first
yeah
and then for each of those there's n
minus 1 to split on next so I feel like
that could be an N factorial kind of
thing maybe I like that and then even
after we've done all that then we have
an exponential number of leaves and for
each of those leaves we could fill in
either true or false
so it's going to be exponential in that
- hmm so let me see if I got that right
so you said we have to pick each
attribute at every level and so you see
something that you think is probably
going to be you know some kind of
combinatorial question here so let's say
in factorial and that's going to just
build the nodes that's just the nodes
but once you have the nodes you still
have to figure out the answers and so
this is exponential because factorial is
exponential and this is also exponential
huh so let's see if we can write that
down so let me propose a way to think
about this Michael you're exactly right
the way you're thinking so let's see if
we can be a little bit more concrete
about it so we have boolean inputs and
we have boolean outputs so this is just
like and it's just like words just like
XOR so whenever we're dealing with
boolean functions we can write down a
truth table so let's think about what
the truth table looks like in this case
so let's look at the truth table so what
a truth table will give me is for the
way a truth table normally works is you
write out each of the attributes so have
to be one attribute to attribute three
and dot dot dot and there's n of those
right we did this a little earlier when
we did our decision tree when we were
trying to figure out whether I was on a
hot date or not and then you have some
kind of output or answer so each of
these attributes could take on true or
false so one kind of input that we might
get would be say all trues right but we
also might get all truths except for one
false at the end or maybe the first
one's false and all the rest of them are
true and so on and so forth and each one
of those possibilities is another row in
our table and that just can go on for we
don't know how long so we have any
number of rows here and my question to
you is how many rows go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
