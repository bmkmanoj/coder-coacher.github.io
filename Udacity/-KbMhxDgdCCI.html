automatically create a view controller
and wire it up for you you even added a
code to this view controller at this
point you might be wondering what is the
view controller and how do I know what
methods to overwrite in it as we're
going to see the documentation will be
our guide the view controller is a
special kind of class that as the name
implies controls a view it handles all
of the actions required by that view in
iOS development this means that this
class is usually a subclass of UI view
controller inherited from the UI kit
framework the view controller is called
by iOS when certain events happen to it
or your app overall in the beginning
your app is not running as soon as the
icon is pressed it moves through the
inactive state and immediately into the
active state when an event happens maybe
a phone call or the user decides to go
to another app your app will transition
to the inactive state and then to the
background from the background state
after a few seconds it will go to the
suspended state what happens when the
user wants to go back to your app if
your app is in the background it will go
through the inactive state to being
active last but not least if iOS needs
more memory and your app is in a
suspended state it may be moved off
memory entirely and we're back to the
beginning of this diagram to the not
running state how do I know what
functions UI view controller has that I
should have arrived how do I know which
functions get called and under what
events in the state diagram it's all in
the documentation and it's always the
first place you should look now it's a
good time to learn how to open up
documentation in Xcode let's open up the
view controller dot Swift file and
navigate to the top here you can see the
line that shows that the view controller
class inherits from UI view controller
if you hold down the option key you can
see that the cursor changes to a
question mark when we go over a class in
this example uiviewcontroller if we
click once we can see a contextual
manual come up showing us all the
information about the UI view controller
class clicking anywhere else dismisses
this contextual menu if you click
anywhere you can dismiss the
documentation pop up another way to see
the full
imitation is to hold down the option key
but this time double click on the UI
view controller class this will show you
the documentation window and open it in
full screen showing us your view
controller another way to view the
documentation window is to go under help
and choose documentation and API
reference you can also get this window
to come up by using the key combination
shift command + 0 anywhere with an Xcode
take a moment now to look for
viewdidload under the UI view controller
documentation</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
