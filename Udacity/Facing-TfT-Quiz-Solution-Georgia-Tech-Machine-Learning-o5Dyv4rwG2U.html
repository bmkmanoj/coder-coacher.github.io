the answer how do we have it how do we
figure it out it's 1/6 I guess that's
what which we don't I don't know if the
it will accept that is whatever 1/6 is
expressed as a decimal but yeah 1/6 how
did you get that I saw the number 6 and
figured it had to be 1/6 because you
said it was low but here's what I
actually did what I was thinking about
it is you said well when are they
equally good well if you always defect
you get minus 6 K over 1 minus gamma and
if you always cooperate you get minus 1
over minus 1 minus gamma so they're
equally good when those two values are
the same good all right and the
dominators are the same as long as gamma
is not one that's fine if we divide by
the negative six we get gamma equals 1/6
exactly excellent so so that's
interesting right so that's it's saying
that for gamma values that are less than
1/6 we should be do it we should just
defect because there's no well the games
not gonna last long enough for us to
form any kind of coalition but for
things higher than 1/6 1/2 3/4 0.999
it's gonna be better to cooperate then
to defect against tit for tat or 1/6
plus epsilon indeed yeah I liked it
that's actually very cool</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
