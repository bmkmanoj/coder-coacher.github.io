could define bigger here's the one
possibility we're gonna make a procedure
we'll give it the name bigger it takes
two inputs we can give them any name we
want since there's no real meaning to
the inputs we'll just use a and B and
now we want to use a test to figure out
which one is bigger we're gonna use a
comparison so we're gonna see if a is
greater than B then we want the result
to be the value of a that's the bigger
one so we'll return a if that's not the
case well if it was the case we returned
a if it's not the case then we're gonna
get here and we can return B so this way
of defining bigger is a little bit
asymmetrical given what you've seen so
far this is probably the best way to do
it there's another way to do that that
uses an extra contract that allows us to
have two directions that we can use the
F in so instead of just having what we
had before where we have an if and we
have a test expression and we have a
block that executes when the test
expression is true what we want to do is
have something that executes when the
test expression is false and we can do
that by using an else we can have after
the if instead of the next statement we
can have an else that's part of the if
this means if the test expression was
true we're going to execute this block
if it's not true we're going to execute
the other block which is inside the else
as before the indentation tells us when
we're done with the block so after the
else whatever code is here will execute
whether the test expression is true or
false the test expression determines
whether we execute the block inside the
if or the block inside the else so let's
see how to rewrite bigger using else
we'll use a and B as the names over
parameters as before and we'll start the
same we're going to have our if and our
test is still a is greater than B and if
that's the case then we return a instead
of having the next statement return B
we're going to think about having an
else clause that says well if a was not
greater than B what should we do if a is
not greater than B then B is either the
same size or bigger and what we want to
do is return B so this means the same
thing
in this case neither one's particularly
better I think this one's a little more
symmetrical there are lots of cases
where it makes things work a lot better
by using else and I'll show you one way
that this could be different if we
didn't want to have two returns maybe we
won't want to do something else with the
result instead of just return it well
with if-else we can do that so we can
have inside the first if we'll assign to
the variable R the result a that's going
to be the one that's bigger inside the
else we'll assign to the variable R the
result B that's the one that's bigger
when the if test fails and now the next
statement here could return our usually
we like our programs to be shorter
rather than bigger in this case when
we're defining bigger maybe the bigger
version is better because that's a
little easier to understand and follow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
