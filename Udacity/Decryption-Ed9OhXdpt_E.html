five style structure that is encryption
and decryption differ only in key
schedule that is in the cushion we apply
the same operations as in encryption but
only with the key sequence in reverse
that is round one of the crip shin uses
the key of the last round of encryption
and so on so forth we can take a closer
look to verify that the Christian radio
works by applying the same operations as
in encryption and only the key sequence
in Reverse in particular we only need to
look at the decryption operations in a
desk round the input to each round for
example the input to the first round of
decryption is actually are an N in the
reverse order meaning the right half is
on the left and the left half is on the
right this is due to the swap operation
at the end of the encryption process for
example the input to the first round of
the cushion would be all 16 and l16
because encryption has 16 rounds and
here because we are using the key
sequence in Reverse in the cushion then
the key using the first run of
decryption is the key using the 16th
round of encryption recall that we can
use algebra to represent the desk
operations if you use those algebra
expressions you will be able to verify
that given this input in the decryption
process you should be able to produce
this output I leave these as an exercise
for you to do at home therefore after 16
round of decryption process the output
would be R and L in plain text and the
final swap operation at the end of the
process would produce the correct
plaintext result aronow in a correct
order and this is how the cushion in Des
works</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
