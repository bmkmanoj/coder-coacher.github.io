of optimization problems versus decision
problems we are ready to dive in so how
can we show that a problem is
intractable we already know how to show
that a problem is tractable we just have
to find a polynomial time algorithm for
it but how do we find out if a problem
is intractable and there's actually two
different ways we could go about this
the first way we could try to show
intractability is by gathering evidence
and what I mean by gathering evidence is
this we have already found out that
Alice Bob and Carol were working on
problems for which they weren't able to
find a polynomial time algorithm but all
of their problems were connected so if
one of them managed to find a solution
then all of their problems will be
tractable so one way we could be
gathering evidence is if we just find
more people working on more hard
problems and of course all of them are
very smart people if we could find more
and more people who are also very smart
working on very tough problems but also
know one of them finds a polynomial time
algorithm so we could basically be
saying look there are so many people who
have looked at this problem none of them
has found out that the problem is
tractable so we think it must be
intractable another way to go about this
would be a mathematical proof and what a
mathematical proof would have to show is
that no matter what kind of intricate
ingenious sophisticated complex
algorithm we use for a problem that
algorithm will still need exponential
time to solve the problem so what I
would like you to think about for our
next quiz is the advantages and
disadvantages of each of these
approaches here and I would like you to
think about two things first of all
which of these approaches is probably
easier to accomplish and secondly which
of these two approaches here would you
find more convincing to show that a
problem is intractable so please give me
you two answers in these bubbles</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
