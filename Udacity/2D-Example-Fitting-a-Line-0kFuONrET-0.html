strike a little bit of recognition in
your mind about the notion of fitting a
line remember we did line fitting okay
in fact we came up with this equation of
saying we're going to measure the error
that's essentially just the
perpendicular error of the points to
this line and in the equation of the
line that we had there was ax plus B Y
minus D equals 0 or it could be plus T
it doesn't matter the idea is that a and
B was the normal with respect to the
line and in fact that's what that says
right there and when I take the dot
product of x and y on that it's supposed
to be a distance D away and that's what
this equation says all right so that was
when we were trying to do at least
squares fit so then we we did this quick
operation we took the derivative with
respect to the D came up with this
formula for D in terms of the average X
the average why we plug that in
substitute deagle ax barbie y bar we get
this new error function e just having
substituted and we wrote it it this way
okay and this is where B is this matrix
here and you can see it's just the X's
and Y's in a rose with the mean
subtracted okay so what we want to do is
we want to minimize that quantity the
magnitude of B times n where n is going
to be the normal a be that we're going
to solve for and we said last time that
what we want to do is we want to
minimize be N squared but remember since
the normal has to be a unit normal we
say subject to n equal 1 now what might
be not so obvious because we even
mentioned exactly last time is that this
distance these squared distances this is
going to be the axis of least let's call
the axis of least inertia right mind you
from your physics I've got an axis then
the inertia of the whole thing is
proportional to the sum of all the
points the squared distance from those
points to the axes so the line fitting
here in 2d is an axis of least nirsa and
like I said this should sound familiar
to you and we remember we did this we
looked at several ways of doing this we
had those
fact back when we did calibration we
said well we have this am we're doing m
matrix for the calibration we said make
let the norm of that well we want to
make it as small as possible subject to
m equal to 1 and remember we were doing
this thing with eigenvalues and
eigenvectors so it shouldn't surprise
you that we're going to be revisiting I
ghen values and eigenvectors</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
