errors is the big thing that static
typing gives you let me explain what
that means so when we run a Python
program while we write the program we
feed others input into the Python
interpreter and the Python interpreter
runs the program jumps around our code
and if at some point we get a type error
the program will crash with a statically
typed language like Java things are
quite different you write a Java program
instead of running that right away you
feed that into what's called a compiler
this is the program that takes the Java
program produces a compiled program in
the case of Java that's called java
bytecodes
it's called different things for
different languages but the other thing
the compiler does is it looks at the
entire program so it's reading the
entire program in if there's anywhere in
the code for that program there's a type
error it's going to give a compile time
type error that means it'll stop it'll
warn the programmer
something's wrong with their program go
fix it you can't even run the program
even if maybe that type of error
somewhere in the code that on all the
executions that you actually do you
would never actually encounter if there
aren't any type errors if the program is
okay the compiler outputs a compiled
program which then is input into the
Java interpreter and that's what runs
the code at the point where the code is
running though we know there are not any
type errors in it because the compiler
would have caught them and stopped the
program from even producing a compiled
program and even being able to run in
the first place so that means with a
statically typed language like Java
we're getting them before we even run
the program with a dynamically typed
language like Python we're getting our
errors later we're not getting them
until we encounter that part of the
program in an execution</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
