diversify his product base he's created
a new kind of wiper set to add to his
glasses family this is the a deluxe duo
a set of glasses wipers unlike any other
ever created they have superior wiping
power and non-functional curlicues for
decoration on the ends of them now as
silly as these glasses wipers might seem
to you or me grant has a reason for
creating them he can charge a lot of
money in fact for just one set of deluxe
duo glasses wipers he can charge $75
this is big money in the glasses wiper
business if we let the number of deluxe
glasses wipers sold equal m and grants
total profit in dollars from them equal
P then I've created an equation for you
that describes his profit based on the
number of deluxe glasses wipers Isolde
you know $75 is how much he charges per
pair of deluxe glasses wipers and five
thousand dollars is the amount of money
that had to put down to invest in the
materials and everything he needed to
start building these so we have an
equation and we have a wonderful product</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
