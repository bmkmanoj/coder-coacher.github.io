so we divided the cipher into the
message part the key part and the part
from this wheel's and now we've
concluded that if we can so we're going
to try 1271 possible settings so for one
of those possible settings we're going
to know all the key bits and that means
if we guess the right setting the key
will go to zero so now all that's left
is the other two parts so this is what
we had before we knew that the
probability of Delta M being 0 was
greater than 1/2 and it was actually
about 0.614 German because of the
likelihood of message letters being
repeated and we knew that the
probability of Delta s being 0 was about
0.7 3 and that's because of the
structure of the machine that the s
wheels don't advance every step only
when the M wheels are on a1 to the s
wheels advance and so now we've said if
we guess right that means the
probability that the key bits are 0 goes
to 1 and it'll be 1 1 we guess right
when we don't guess right
it'll be 1/2 so in order to tell if we
guess right well we need to know that
the probability of the ciphertext bits
when we guess right the probability of
the Delta Z is being 0 will be different
from 1/2 the question is what is the
probability Delta Z is 0 when we guess
right and remember that what Delta Z is
is the XOR of Delta M Delta K and Delta
s so to solve this you need to think
about all the different things that
would make Delta Z equal to 0 and
compute their probability</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
