but others want to handle the problems
of reliability and flow control in their
own way for this they often use the user
Datagram protocol or UDP which is much
simpler the header that gets attached to
the payload includes only the source and
destination ports the length of the data
and a checksum to help detect data
corruption there is no initial handshake
or enforced mechanism for the order of
packets that just fired across the
network lyndah's UDP used well if you
have a very reliable local network then
there's no need for the reliability or
out of order protections of TCP all of
those acknowledgments would just be
wasted bandwidth you would rather have
the lower overhead of the smaller UDP
header and protocol streaming
applications red is more important to be
on time than to be right prefer UDP
think of voice over IP a user would much
prefer a temporary degradation in the
quality of sound - incurring a delay
which makes conversation difficult if a
packet is dropped we might want to
simply say that it is too late and not
bothered trying to incorporate its data
similarly for video a user would much
prefer an occasional low-quality frame
to having the video intermittently start
and stop but with a perfect picture UDP
tends to be more popular for these types
of applications</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
