there are some problems one problem is
remember I told you that the way you do
the dot product since these are images
the vectors you're going to line them up
and multiply them that was the dot
product that's how you take the dot
product of these two ten thousand
dimensional vectors that should have
made you wonder well what happens if
it's misaligned right the eyes aren't
exactly in the right place okay the
scale is a little bit different the
answer is it doesn't work very well
right it really requires good alignment
scaling also the background has to be
not too too terrible that can be done
but it is a sensitivity of the method
another cute little story at the time
they had these eight thousand faces and
they wanted to put them in a scale in a
scaled lined up way and so you could
imagine trying to write a computer
program that would sort of find where
the eyes were and then line them up or
you could pay an undergraduate so they
paid an undergrad just to click on the
pupils of the eyes of each picture of
the eight thousand pictures I think his
first name was wasi I can't remember if
you're out there up my apologies and
what was great as sandy will tell you is
as the student was working on these
eight thousand pictures he came back and
said I have a new or new appreciation
for what order of magnitude means
because the difference between doing 80
pictures and eight thousand pictures as
you can imagine took a long time but you
basically have to line this up now you
can use methods to automatically align
the eyes scale etc and then that kind of
thing will work another limitation that
is sort of a more theoretical basis for
PCA and general principle pone analysis
typically the way you do it is you take
your entire population you find the
direction of variance over the whole
population you project down along those
dimensions and then you try to
discriminate between the different
classes in this data here we have blue
points and we have red points but if the
first thing you did was find the axis of
elongation okay the axis along which
there's the most variation all right and
you projected these points down well
clearly you will confuse the blue point
and the red points right so as it
happens to be that the way of separating
the classes right so the direction along
which you want to separate the classes
is not the direction along which the all
the points are distributed there is
methods in pattern recognition Fisher
analysis linear discriminant analysis
for using not just the structure of the
population but the structure of the
classes to determine which way to
separate we won't talk about them here
because kind of an old method but it
actually talks more about the
discriminative methods that will talk
about not next time at the time after
the idea is saying that well I don't
need so much to model the points
themselves because the points are
elongated this way I need to model the
separation between the points so a
limitation of PCA is that sometimes the
direction of maximum variance is not
always the best direction to project on
for doing classification</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
