that I like to give a little bit of
history when I talk about a specific
topic so I'm gonna do the same also in
this case for refactoring I'm gonna
start by mentioning the fact that
refactoring is something that
programmers have always done I give you
a trivial example just a minute ago of
what refactoring is so even more
complicated refactorings are something
that are commonplace for developers
somehow refactoring is especially
important in the context of
object-oriented languages and probably
it's because the object-oriented
features are well suited to make designs
flexible and reusable because of the
fact that help encapsulation information
hiding and so they make it easier to
modify something without changing the
functionality that it provides to the
outside world however you should keep in
mind that refactoring is really not
specific to object-oriented languages
you can also reflector other languages
it's just more common to sit in that
context so one of the first examples of
a specific discussion of what
refactorings are is objects PhD thesis
in 1990 which discusses refactorings for
small talk and some of you might be
familiar with small talk which is a
specific object-oriented language any
more recent times refactoring is
becoming increasingly popular due to
lightweight development methodologies
due to agile development which is
something that we just discussed in this
class for example when we talked about
extreme programming we mentioned
refactoring a few times and the reason
why it's so popular is because
refactoring is one of the practices that
help making changes less expensive and
therefore adapt to changing requirements
and to change an environment more
quickly and continuing with this
historical perspective one of the
milestones in the history of
refactorings is the book by Martin
fuller this is a book entitled improving
the design of existing code and it
contains the catalog of refactorings a
list of bad smells in code and we're
gonna see what that means exactly
nothing to do with other kinds of bad
smells it talks about guidelines on when
to apply refactoring and finally which
is very useful it provides example of
code before and after applying a
refactoring and we're gonna use more or
less the same style when discussing
refactoring in the rest of this lesson
more specifically what we're discussing
next are some examples of refactorings
and also some examples of code bad
smells</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
