have all these X's floating around so
let's just take it easy let's write a
super simple inequality maybe one is
less than two those are two numbers that
I think I can handle right now let's
check this on a number line to make sure
that I'm not crazy well here's one and
here's two we're going to look at just
the range of values that is less than
two and that is all of these values to
the left of 2 1 is definitely in this
interval when I was looking at our
earlier inequality I ran it into a
problem when I divided both sides of the
inequality by negative 1 i'll make some
room here and now let's see what happens
if i divide both sides of the inequality
by negative 1 so what number do we get
on either side of our inequality if we
divide both sides by negative 1 make
sure you keep the numbers on the sides
of their on right now for the purposes
of this answer after that I'd like you
to consider your answer and tell me
whether or not this makes sense</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
