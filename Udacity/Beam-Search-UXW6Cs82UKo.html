things imagine that you have a model
that predicts the next step of your
sequence for example you can use that to
generate sequences for example texts
either one word at a time or one
character at a time for that you take
your sequence at time T you generate the
predictions from your RNN and then you
sample from the predicted distribution
meaning you pick one elements based on
its probability and feed that sample to
the next step and go on do this
repeatedly predict sample predict sample
and you can generate a pretty good
sequence of whatever your RNN models
there's a more sophisticated way to do
this that gives better results because
just sampling the next prediction every
time is very greedy instead of just
sampling once at each step you could
imagine sampling multiple times here you
pick oh but also a for example then you
have multiple sequences often called
hypotheses that you could continue
predicting from at every step you can
choose the best sequence out of those by
computing the total probability over all
the characters that you've generated so
far by looking at the total probability
of a multiple time steps at a time you
prevent the sampling from accidentally
making one byte choice and being stuck
with that one bad decision forever for
example we could have just picked a by
chance here and never explored the
hypothesis that all could lead to a very
sensible next word of course if you do
this Navy the number of sequences that
you need to consider grows exponentially
there is a smarter way to do that which
is to do what's called a beam search you
only keep say the most likely few
candidate sequences at every time step
and then simply prune the rest in
practice this works very well for
generating very good sequences from your
model</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
