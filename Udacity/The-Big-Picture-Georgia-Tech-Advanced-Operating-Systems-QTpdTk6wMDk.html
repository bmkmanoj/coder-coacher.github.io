practice together in the design cycle
theory is good for expressing abstract
specifications of the system at the
level of individual components for this
part of the design cycle namely
specification of what we want to build a
theoretical framework called IO automata
is used and its syntax is very similar
to C like syntax and so in terms of
writing the specification it's very
intuitive in how we go about using IOR
Tomita to develop the system
requirements and specify them using the
syntax provided by our automata and more
importantly the composition operator
that's available in IO our Tomita allows
expressing specification of an entire
subsystem that we want to build example
if you want to build a tcp/ip protocol
stack then all of the functional
relationship between the components of
the subsystem can be expressed using the
powerful specification language
primitives available in iOS ometer the
second part of the design cycle is
converting the specification in ieee
automata to code that can be actually
executed and for this purpose the
programming language that is used is a
high-level programming language called
Oh camel stands for object-oriented
categorical abstract machine language
and it has several properties that make
a camel a very good candidate for doing
component based design as we are
proposing to do in this lesson number
one the formal semantics that is
available in a camel is a nice
complement to the specification that we
have done using IO at emitter that's
number one reason why Oh camel is a good
vehicle for converting the specification
into code the second nice property that
it has is its object-oriented being an
object-oriented language it has some
very nice properties such as no
side-effects for things that you do in
the program and in fact this comes from
the fact that Oh camel is
functional programming language so some
of the properties of the functional
programming language including no side
effects and so on make this an
appropriate vehicle to convert the
specification in the code and third
perhaps the most important
characteristic from an operating system
designers point of view is that the code
that you can generate with a camel is as
efficient as C code this is super
important when you're developing
operating systems because you care about
performance object-oriented is good
formal semantics is good but you also
want to know to know that you get good
performance out of it and yes you can
get pretty good performance out of camel
because the object code that we can
generate from the o camel compiler is
very efficient similar to C all of these
make Oh camel a good vehicle for going
from specification to actual code at
this point what we have is an an
optimized code that faithfully
implements the specification that we
started out with and remember that we're
doing component based design so it's
going to be highly unoptimized because
there's a lot of cruft that goes between
these components that you put together
like Lego blocks so we have to optimize
it before it is ready for primetime now
how do we do that well once again we
turn to theory new Perl is a theoretical
framework for optimization of Oh camel
code the input to this framework is the
Oh camel code and the output that you
get is an optimized version of a
functionally equivalent Oh camel code so
that's what this optimization framework
gives you takes as input an optimized Oh
camel code and produces optimized or
camel corps and the optimized Oh camel
code can be theoretically verified to be
functionally equivalent to the
unoptimized input Oh camel code that's
the beauty of the theoretical framework
and the way it does that is a little bit
beyond the scope of this course it uses
a theorem proving framework in order to
do this and verify through theorem
proving that the resulting code that is
generated is equivalent to the input
code which was unoptimized
I have given you the big picture of the
design cycle now it is time to go into
the weeds</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
