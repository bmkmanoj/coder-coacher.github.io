the playground file entitled lesson 1
underscore strings and then of course
you'll want to check in your editors
menu that down here at the second of the
last item says show raw markup if you
see a bunch of green comments you're
going to want to click show rendered
markup there's a lot of fun to be had
playing with strings and Swift strings
are no exception earlier you saw strings
defined as string literals and you also
saw Swift style string concatenation
because Swift string class is built from
Unicode scalar values one can type emoji
directly into string literals like this
oh yeah to bring up the emoji keyboard
like that I do control command spacebar
and then I can choose the heart another
time-saving feature of Swift strings is
support for string interpolation in
other words inserting values of
variables and expressions directly into
string literals let's say we have a
statement about how much a particular
dog eats per month and remember you can
always see the result of the executed
code over here in the sidebar now let's
say instead of Lulu we want to know how
much Ferris the spring or do deletes per
month here I've declared dog named as a
variable and then I've inserted it into
my string and over here on the right you
can see that the string evaluates to
Ferris eats 25 pounds of dog food per
month we can add expressions to our
string as well let's say we're really
only paying attention to how much Ferris
eats per day this monthly consumption
rate can actually be evaluated as the
string is built and of course I do that
by typing backslash and then parentheses
and then between the parenthesis I put
the expression I want to evaluate so
pounds per day times days per month
and again you can see the output hasn't
changed much now our doggy diet string
is much more customizable for example if
we want to calculate the pounds per
month eaten by lil Frankie here all we
have to do is change the value of pounds
per day reassign the dog name variable
and then reevaluate our doggy diet
string and then over here we can see
that lil Frankie it's a eat 7.5 pounds
of dog food per month</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
