a chapter named The Devil's guide to
debugging which was written by a guy
named Steve McConnell new book the book
is being called code complete in 1993
and it encompassed all the wisdom about
programming that Steve McConnell had at
the time what we've seen so far is just
three of these rules the first one is to
scatter out print statements everywhere
in the code output whatever you want
where he wanted just put it in there
such that you will always be able to
figure out what was going on or not the
second one is to debug the program into
existence just keep on adding statements
and removing statements until it works
never ever back up earlier versions of
your code I mean who can't remember what
he or she has done just seven minutes
ago rule number four don't bother
understanding what the program should do
I mean it's obvious isn't it if it's not
obvious make it obvious my all-time
favorite though is number five use the
most obvious fix that means fix the
symptom instead of the problem</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
