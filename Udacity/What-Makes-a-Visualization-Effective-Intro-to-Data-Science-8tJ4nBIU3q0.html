important ingredients to any information
visualization visual cues coordinate
systems scale and data types and context
let's use this line chart which shows
total home runs by year in Major League
Baseball to showcase each of these
ingredients so the first ingredient was
visual cues or visual encoding this is
encoding data with shapes colors and
sizes for example if we look at this
chart we can show that each point shows
the number of home runs in a given year
and we can also see that the lines
connecting the points give us some sense
of the rate of change of number of home
runs hit from year to year there are
also coordinate systems so we need to
place our data points somewhere on the
chart a coordinate system gives us a
structured space that dictates where the
shapes and colors should go this gives
meaning to an XY coordinate on this
chart for example in this particular
graphic the x-axis represents time and
the y-axis represents total number of
home runs hit whereas the coordinate
system tells us what various dimensions
of our visualization may correspond to
the scale or data type will tell you
where exactly your data needs to go
there are three types of skills that we
could use numeric categorical and time
series in this example we're using
numerical data on the y-axis the total
number of home runs and we have time on
the x-axis the year note that both of
them are a linear scale so numbers are
evenly spaced out there are other types
of scales which we'll discuss later and
the final important ingredient of an
information visualization is context so
if your audience is unfamiliar with the
data it's your job to clarify what
values in your graphic are present and
explain the people how they should read
your chart so in this particular
visualization I have provided some
context by giving the chart a title
number of MLB home runs by year labeling
the axes year and total home runs and I
could do a little bit more by annotating
the chart potentially so there are a
variety of things that might inform the
total number of home runs hit in a
particular year maybe the beginning of
the live-ball era which we might put
somewhere over here the crack
down on steroid use which happens
somewhere around the year 2000 etc these
annotations might help people interpret
this data and understand the story of
why the number of home runs hit by year
is changing over time it's important to
emphasize that data is the driving force
behind all four of these ingredients</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
