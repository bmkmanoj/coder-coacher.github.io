different words to mean almost the same
thing you can say cats or you can say
kitty they're not the same but they mean
similar things remember that when we
have things that are similar we really
really would like to share parameters
between them but Kitty is completely
different from cats so if we want to
share anything between them we're going
to have to learn that they are related
so that's a very big problem for deep
learning we'd like to see those
important words often enough to be able
to learn their meanings automatically
and we'd also like to learn how words
relate to each other so that we can
share parameters between them but that
would mean collecting a lot of label
data in fact it would require way too
much label data for any task that really
matters</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
