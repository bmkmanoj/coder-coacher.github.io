controller in the objective-c project
you'll notice that there's a property
for a gif image view go ahead and add
this property in your gift editor view
controller dot Swift file and connect it
to the gif image view in storyboard
we're also going to add a property to
hold the gift URL and that property will
be an optional of type nsurl we'll set
it to nil for now once you've got the
gift URL set up we're going to want to
add some code to the method view will
appear this code will render the gif URL
as a gift kind of like we did in the
Welcome view controller will make a gift
from the recording by calling the method
gift with URL and notice that gift with
URL takes a string as a parameter so
we'll need to use the absolute string
property of our nsurl and then we'll
load that image into the gif image view
and of course let's not forget to call
super dot view will appear with these
lifecycle methods we always have to
remember to call super back in our UI
view controller plus record extension
will instantiate an instance of the gift
editor at our gift URL and then push
that onto the navigation stack we're
going to do all that in the method
called display gif so first we
instantiate our gift editor view
controller pass it the gift URL and then
push it onto the navigation stack and of
course we'll want to call the method
display gif from the method convert
video to gif so that we can pass it the
gif URL we just got from regift and we
won't forget to unwrap it we're also
going to need to call this convert video
to gif method somewhere we can do that
up and did finish picking media with
info remember we were just saving the
video to the photo album instead we'll
just call convert video to gif and now
we'll run it so let's see how it looks
here comes the camera there's my video
producer seeing how many malt balls he
can stuff in his mouth
the camera dismisses and there's our
gift</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
