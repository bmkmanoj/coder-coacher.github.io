a good thing let's hear for more about
why we look at correlation in the first
place and what it can tell us about two
variables so in addition to doing
scatter plots where you can visually see
how related two variables are typically
I will actually measure their
correlation coefficient to really
quantify how correlated they are this is
really important because a lot of the
data that I work with is correlated with
each other so for example looking at
Facebook data
how many status updates someone posts in
a month is really highly correlated
usually with how many days in the last
month they logged in or how many friends
they have or how many photos they
uploaded in the last month all of these
variables are typically very highly
related and it's usually because they
all kind of measure the same thing it's
how engaged someone is and so typically
when I'm working on a problem and I'm
going to be doing some kind of
regression or I'm modeling something I'm
going to be throwing some of these
variables into the regression and one of
the assumptions of regression is that
these variables are independent of each
other
and so if any two are too highly
correlated with each other
it'll be really difficult to tell which
ones are actually driving the phenomenon
and so it's important to measure the
correlation between your variables first
often because it'll help you determine
which ones you don't actually want to
throw in together and it might help you
decide which ones you actually want to
keep</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
