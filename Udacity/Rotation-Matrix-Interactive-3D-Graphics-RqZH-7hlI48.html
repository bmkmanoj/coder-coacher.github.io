form rotation matrices here's what one
of them looks like a rotation around the
z axis the Greek letter theta is the
angle of rotation the cosine and sine of
this angle are used to form a somewhat
symmetric piece of the matrix here the
rest of the matrix is left alone by
leaving these values in the third row
zero and this value here being one this
has the effect of leaving the Z
coordinate untouched this makes sense
since when you rotate around the z axis
the Z values shouldn't change here's a
real rotation matrix around the z axis
for a rotation angle of 50 3.1 degrees
as an example the coordinate 1 0 0
transforms to the coordinate zero point
six zero point eight zero the coordinate
is rotated counterclockwise around the
origin one way to look at things is that
you're rotating a point from one
location to another another way to look
at it is that you're changing the frame
of reference the rotation transform can
also be thought of taking our original
point and looking it up to see what
value it has on these two new axes for
example on our new x axis the points
coordinate is zero point six on our new
y axis the points coordinate is zero
point eight on the left we're rotating
the coordinate with respect to the axes
on the right we're rotating the axes and
then seeing where the coordinate lies
with respect to these axes either
interpretation is correct and both have
their strengths if we rotate the first
interpretation so that the x and y axes
are aligned with the second we see that
the transformed point is in the same
orientation to the axes in both cases
this second interpretation is the one
that helped me understand how a dot
product is rotating a point in an
earlier lesson we talked about how the
dot product between two normalized
vectors gives us the cosine of the angle
between them rotation is a similar use
of the dot product we use the cosine of
the rotation angle to give us two new
axes both of which are normalized that
is their lengths are both 1 the dot
product between our test points
coordinates and each rotation axis gives
us the coordinate of a new location for
example zero point six is here and zero
point eight goes over here a dot product
projects one vector onto another which
is what gives us these coordinates that
was a simple test case where the vector
to our test
point was of length one if we do the
same analysis for another point we get
the same result with both ways of
thinking here's a new point which has
the same location on both of our graphs
on the Left we rotate the point to its
new position then read the coordinates
off of its axes on the right we rotate
the axes and read the points coordinates
with respect to these axes for example
here's X's and Y's the way we read off
these coordinates is to take a dot
product between each axis and the vector
to the point so here's our x-axis and
here's our vector and we take a dot
product between the two to get this
value here this is what a matrix does
computes a dot product when we've used
the dot product for materials both
vectors were normalized here our axis is
normalized but the vector to the point
is not the vector here can be of any
length</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
