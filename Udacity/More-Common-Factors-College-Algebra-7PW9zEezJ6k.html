plus 10 we got really lucky in how we
got to factor because there is a common
factor of 2 between all three of these
terms but you can imagine that for some
polynomials whose coefficients in front
of the x squared term aren't one this
won't be the case let's say for example
that we had an 11 here instead of a 12
then we can no longer begin the problem
by dividing all the terms by this too so
we're not going to end up with a
quadratic expression with a 1 front that
we know how to factor right away we need
to figure out another method for
factoring I think we should backtrack to
the thing that we first started
factoring with let's look at the general
case of a quadratic polynomial that's
been factored and whose leading
coefficient will be 1 we have x + a + X
+ B as our linear factors let's go
through multiplying this out again I
know we've done it many times before
okay so multiplying this out we get x
squared plus the quantity a plus B times
X plus a be one of a set of a and B we
want to play with real numbers but maybe
in playing with those real numbers I
want to keep the equation for the
quadratic in this form let's say we
start out with a polynomial x squared
plus 5x plus 6 we know that we can
rewrite this recognizing that two and
three are factors of six and also add
equal five as x squared plus the
quantity 2 plus 3 times X plus 6 which
pretty simply becomes x squared plus 2x
plus 3x plus 6 great now this probably
all seems simple leading up until now
but now I'm going to ask you to do
something a little bit different the
thing that I'd like you to do that
probably will feel a little bit strange
is to look first at just the first two
terms here and find a factor between the
two of them that's in common pull it out
and then write the rest of the
expression in here and then do the same
thing for the second pair of factors
find a common factor and factor it out
then write the expression that you have
after that right here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
