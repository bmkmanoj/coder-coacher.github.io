hours we had a lot of great questions on
twiddle and parameter optimization so
let's get started so first question
comes from George brindar oh and he
wants to know first is Twitter really
all that good does it really give better
results than other methods you might use
for selecting parameters where George is
a great question it's good in only one
dimension which is it's really easy to
implement and sometimes people overlook
this there's an entire literature on
parameter search proposition and a lot
of cases where twiddle would favor other
method will succeed you can write a PhD
thesis about this but the nice thing is
twiddle takes you no time to implement
and I've never seen a piece of code that
couldn't be made better with a little
tool around it that's why I explain it I
think it's just an easy method I use it
I literally use it all the time okay
another question from George about
twiddle is local minimum are they a
problem with twiddle it seems like it's
pretty easy to get caught in one it
would be a fantastic final exam question
sorry for taking out of the final exam
and of course it's susceptible to local
minima it's essentially a good climbing
technique it many might occasion jump
over because of the step size but by and
large we're going down the hill it's
also going to get stuck on ridges and
other phenomena that might occur or
insert an optimization spaces so it's
really good if you have a good guess for
the initial parameters it's pretty
horrible you want to search
systematically the nave to things like
great search or sending a kin of
particle filters as a randomized methods
for searching as well okay Matt Bradley
wants to know how you can smooth the
vehicles path and still guarantee that
it's going to be collision-free it seems
like sometimes that new path may run
into an obstacle you had previously
avoided men do you absolutely right and
that's regrettable for the obstacle and
the car it turns out in practice the
smoothing techniques that we use a
little bit more sophisticated that is
it's not just points in XY space but
it's successive state vectors for cars
and the parameters from one to the next
other steering commands for the car and
then you can actually often much better
guarantee that you stay away from
obstacles as soon as this issue of how
to ostagar
talent and you have to put into your
optimization terms a constraint that
expels you away from these obstacles and
to be honest this becomes a bit of a
black art of the tune these parameters I
had a PhD student work on very narrow
openings with smoothing where we use the
the distance between obstacles as one
way to scale the pressure that obstacle
would assert on the path to put away
from themselves so the opposite the
carpet would be able to go through very
narrow passages but in very wide peso
just wouldn't go straight to the middle
of it it's a bit of a black art and
media trying to scratch the service here
all right as Lauren Oh wants to know so
in the unit we had this PID exercise
where we were driving the car and trying
to get it to align with this straight
line and y equal zero he found that when
halfway through his run he switched the
new to their target to y equals two
instead after the car had already gotten
going on y equals zero pretty well
things went sort of haywire give any
idea what may have happened and it seems
like in reality moving target is a
pretty common thing to have in a car so
how do we accommodate that don't do that
don't do the video on car okay your car
will go haywire so it turns out in all
of controls there's something called the
basin of attraction and that says a
controller when you look at it
mathematically is only guaranteed to
succeed which means we call the stable
if its initial set point the distance
save from and then the angle and so on
from the reference trajectory is
confined in a specific area and if you
were to analyze our controller which
happens to be a nice Daniel controller
so you can actually do this you'd
probably find that the set point to off
is outside the basin of Attraction
specifically you have an integral term
that are we particularly bad there's
other ways to to to derail it so you
could have the car and my face the wrong
direction and I believe the car will
produce anything that you wouldn't
expect and so when you can do that
control or practically and theoretically
it's useful to guarantee to yourself or
convince yourself they dividend this
basin of attraction where the controller
actually works I love the fact that
you're running this experiment because
that's the kind of stuff that's really
interesting to run I mean I think it's
much more interesting to break things
then have things work because we can we
can understand where the boundaries are
and you found one and that's really
really great I didn't even talk about
this in class thank you next question
comes from Omar chahata he's a high
school student he's taking this course
and he's going to be applying to
colleges soon so mom okay no go on any
advice go oh well I'm your fan that's it
no go okay so you must know if you have
any advice for projects he could tackle
um hopefully that would show college
admissions committees how much he's
learning so my I'm your fan keep doing
what you're doing do you have your life
ahead of you which is wonderful and you
ask no education you're taking my class
like anxious to take this class is
fantastic and all the high school
students out there you guys rock in the
darpa grand challenge one of the tough
competitors was a team from Southern
California a high school thick person
named a pile of orders i believe and it
was mostly girls turns out and it all
under the age of 17 and they actually
beat MIT out of the prelims in the grand
challenge I was insanely impress and
these students to the present day
actually my yours what can you do
there's a us first my friend Dean came
and started this competition it's a
great way to be creative there is legal
mindstorms that you can play with and
have a lot of fun with and be creative
about it there's all kinds of
interesting mathematics / robotics our
Olympians where people do hard problems
have programming problems and so on the
only thing I take issue with is I think
we pay way too much attention to the
admissions process and way too little
attention which is having fun and learn
something I've never worried about
admission I end up at Stanford because I
couldn't decide and one so I get older
and older and eventually he became
professor I think I think the the focus
on having fun explosion anyone else any
new to me is one that I wish she could
you could maybe remember when you
because that's really the most important
thing in life in my opinion it's good
advice I think thank you mjl talked
about his own experience is driving a
car and how his decisions on the road
don't just depend on where his car is
and where he wants to go but also on how
fast he's going and that's something we
haven't talked about much how to
incorporate speed into robot decisions
you're coming from Germany we don't
believe more you won't help out just
kidding absolutely correct and there's
multiple aspects to speed you bring up
one that is if you take the team same
turning videos at a higher speed your
lateral acceleration goes up the
sideways acceleration and eventually
your car will all spin flip slide or
similar but it won't work anymore so in
our work on the Google car on the
Sanford car we put actually a limit on
the lateral acceleration and make that
the thing so it means on highways our
turning Vegas is significantly larger
than see an apartment and that's true
for any human driver as well the second
part we didn't talk much about this
selection of speed and I didn't because
the control methods are not as quite as
interesting as the steering control but
basically you can imagine that you cross
sector speed that you can always come to
a safe stop so every obstacle in your
way of a pedestrian on the side every
car in front of you puts a limit on the
speed as does of course the legal speed
limit and in the controller is one that
uses the throttle and the gas to
gradually pull back in a PRD by actually
to the set speed that's a maximum legal
speed or advisable speed given all these
other constraints the lateral
acceleration does impose on the maximum
speed so when we know they have to drive
a turn we can compute what will be the
acceleration base for different speeds
and and then Dec propagators into the
equation for speed and it gives us a
limit on speed as well so our car
naturally slows down before turning and
is that maximum lateral acceleration
does it depend on things like road
condition which I imagine would oops
slippery road would of course have it
should it's good good I think it doesn't
that presently doesn't it will in the
future we have a bit of a
time are knotted 24 the exact word
conditions are partially because we
don't have access to the stability
management systems on cars themselves
but it s you should I agree okay Laurent
oh and another question about twiddle
this one's about correlated parameters
so it seems like twiddle we're adjusting
one parameter at a time what if we have
a situation where we need to change both
of these parameters or two or of to the
three or three parameters to really get
a better minima so that's a fantastic
question that's a case of it'll just
fear you if you have a small diagonal
Ridge and two permits have to pull
evolve it will just fail this fixes and
again as an entire literature the most
easy fixes if we happen to know that
direction you can twiddle in that
direction okay there's only called
adaptive samplers that actually learn
about this direction dynamically and
build gradients to follow there's all
kinds of other methods that look at
these the surface shape and model the
surface shape and define the optimal
direction to go again twiddle was only
given because it's so simple and I hope
you found it to be very effective it was
partially given because I couldn't
figure out what the right control
parameters are so I just implement this
little thing but yes there's many many
ways to improve our fiddle all right um
Philip says points out that there's
going to have to be some sort of time
lag between when you make your commands
and win the car she responds to it so
how do you account for that time lag so
Philip it's a it's a great question this
is what a lot of our time goes into this
is a really really really hard question
the time lag basically kills everything
so if we had a if you take your current
control software say and you make the
controller and then you add say a tenth
of a unit of time and delay in there
just just try it out and pretend that
the always acting on the previous sensor
measurement you'll be amazed how bad the
carpet life because it would constantly
oversteer and understeer the best method
we have are now is to use a predictive
controller which is we have a model of
the car we know at what time the control
command was issued when the sensor
measurement was taken how much time the
processing took and we kind of predict
what the measurement would be at the
time the processing is finished
then use this as an input and if you
know about a time delays in the vehicle
itself to execute commands we made this
on the second thing we do is we actually
more than the car more detail tonight
then I pretend it so in the way I oiled
it felt like we could set the steering
wheel to any set point instantaneously
but a physical struggle is an ocean so
instead of modeling the the set point we
have a secondary controller that
understands how much torque it takes to
turn a steering wheel and use this as an
information so the better your model the
more accurate the control and and take
some road to get it right okay thank you
and the last question comes from Martin
and he wants to know weapons on the
physical model that we're facing all of
our decisions on changes so if the car
gets a flat tire or something along
those lines what happens whatever still
be able people actually quite amazing so
you can do the test yourself pick up a
box you have no clue if it is someone
puts a break-in inside or not you lift
it you can completely adjust the names
of your body the posture of your body to
be able to walk with it I find this
unbelievably amazing we have this kind
of intuition how to handle things and we
really reconfigure our body cars can do
this to some extent they can do it
specifically if they have a model of the
change so if they understand which way
to say a blown tire effexor dynamics and
there's been a lot of work on this you
can run multiple predictive models one
with a blown tire and one without a low
tire and then when the man with the
broad hair comes along then this model
of a sudden becomes a more plausible to
explain what's happening it's kind of
what people also do in a very very fast
way they understand well I tried
something it didn't quite work and then
they correct for it PID control the
somewhat robust to it like when we'd be
me to put the drift in the tire there
was a change like this but yes a blown
tire will very quickly leverage the pd
controller out of the basin of
attraction for stable control and as a
result it could really happen that the
same flips in reality the number of
things you can happen to a car at red
numbers from the mattress on the highway
all the way to the ground fire to the
defect computer which also affects the
and I wouldn't claim we've solved this
problem be really water that's at Google
right now through these different
situations make the system as robust as
possible and it's for me it's still open
problem how to control the car wells and
also notice that at tires blown so
thanks for asking this question all
right so thanks a lot for the good
questions thank you for helping incident
next week we're doing slam me think yeah
we're Muslim means whatever Swiss being
slammed I don't know i think slam slam
slam slam alright simultaneous ring slam
come see the slam lecture i want to say
a word that I mean we started with many
tens of thousands of students as the
huge number of students left but when
you at this point and ask this level of
question you are a serious person and I
totally appreciate this this isn't an
easy course in fact this course is
really hard thanks for asking such
insightful questions I'm going to go
back to the discussion forum and answer
some more questions there and it gets a
CEO in class see you next week</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
