click the mouse on your computer let's
say you're running the Google Earth
application and you select the points
that you want to visit on the globe by
clicking the mouse when you click the
mouse first the hardware controller that
is interfacing the mouse which is a
hardware device to the system using the
conduit of the bus is going to raise an
interrupt on the interrupt line which is
one of the dedicated lines on the bus
this conduit which I call the bus
contains as you know data lines and
address lines and one of the things it
also contains is an interrupt line or
multiple interrupt lines and the
controller asserts this interrupt line
to indicate to the CPU that it wants
attention it's sort of like if I'm
teaching a class and you all but a live
audience
if you have a question you may raise
your hand and that's exactly what
happens when you click the mosque the
equivalent of raising your hand in a
classroom is what the controller is
doing by asserting the interrupt line on
the bus asserting the interrupt line on
the bus results in an interrupt to the
CPU now the processor at this point of
time is running some program perhaps
your Google Earth application is being
run on the CPU at this point of time an
interrupt is a hardware mechanism for
alerting the processor that something
external in this case the mouse click
requires the attention of the processor
it's sort of like a doorbell in a house
someone is ringing the doorbell someone
has got to pay attention to who is at
the door remember that the CPU is a dumb
animal all it can do is execute
instructions right now it's executing
some application now an interrupt comes
in some other program has to run on it
in order to feel that interrupt answer
the doorbell who's the entity that is
the operating system the operating
system which is also a collection of
programs schedules itself to run on the
processor
that it can answer the doorbell so the
operating system is the one that feels
this interrupt finds out who it is
intended for and passes it to the
program for appropriate action for this
particular interrupt this example of a
mouse-click and what happens between the
hardware and the software is a good way
to segue into the abstractions provided
by an operating system for managing the
hardware resources</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
