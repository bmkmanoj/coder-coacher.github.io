testing topic which is random testing
and random testing just means the test
cases are created at least in part using
input from a random number generator
this became my favorite testing method a
few years ago when I noticed that
without even realizing it I'd written a
random tester for every piece of
software I ever wrote were actually
cared about as Trek --mess so I've
written at least a dozen random testers
let's look at how this works we have a
random test case generator test case
generator takes as input pseudo-random
numbers so PRNG here stands for
pseudo-random number generator of course
on computers we almost never get real
random number generators we rather get
our pseudo-random numbers which are
algorithmically generated but for
purposes of creating test cases they're
good enough the nice thing about
pseudo-random numbers is they're
repeatable so when we start using a
pseudo-random number generator we give
it a seed which completely determines
the sequence of random numbers it's
going to generate so if we ever want to
generate the same random numbers all we
have to do is remember the seed and this
is actually really nice because we don't
have to save off lots of voluminous
random tests we can rather just remember
what seed we started with if we everyone
want to get back a particular set of
random tests the other thing that goes
into a random test case generator
usually to make a good one you need a
significant amount of domain knowledge
but domain knowledge that just means
that you have to understand some
properties of the software under test
we'll talking quite a bit of detail
about what form this domain knowledge
might take and how you encode this as
part of the random test case generator
so generated test cases come out of the
random test case generator and they go
into the software under test software
under test execute produces some output
the output is inspected by a test Oracle
in the Oracle as we've already learned
makes a determination whether the output
of the software under test was either
good or bad if the output is good that
is to say if it passes whatever checks
we have we just go back and do it again
on the other hand if the outputs not
okay we save the test case somewhere for
later inspection and we go back and do
more random testing and so the key to
making this all work is we wrap the
entire random testing tool chain in some
sort of a driver script which runs it
automatically what we do is we start the
random tester on some on some otherwise
done use machine we go into other things
or we go home and while we're doing
other things the random testing loop
executes hundreds or thousands or
millions of times
next time we feel like seeing what's
going on maybe we come to work in the
morning and we basically just see what
kind of test cases have been saved if
anything interesting turned up we have
some follow-up work to do like creating
a reportable test case and debugging if
nothing interesting happened then that's
good we didn't introduce any new bugs
and we can rebuild the latest version of
the software under test
and start the testing loop again
generally the way random testing works
is it's not necessarily part of the test
suite for the software under test but
rather it's a separate testing loop that
gets run independently acts as a
separate or an external Quality
Assurance mechanism if the random test
case generator is well done and if we
give us a sufficient amount of CPU
resources to the testing loop and if
it's not finding any problems random
testing can significantly increase our
confidence that the software under test
is working as intended and it turns out
that in general they're only a couple
things that are hard about making this
work first of all it can be tricky to
come up with a good random test case
generator and second it can be tricky to
come up with good Oracles and of course
we've already said that these are the
hard things about testing in general
making test cases and determining if
outputs are correct basically the same
thing is the case here but the character
of the problems that we run into while
doing random testing are a little bit
different and and that's what we're
gonna spend the next several units of
this course looking at what I like to do
now is go over a couple of real examples
one of them involves a very large random
tester testing quite complicated pieces
of software the other one is almost
trivial it's a tiny almost one-line
random tester that's testing a small
function that I wrote so let's take a
look at those</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
