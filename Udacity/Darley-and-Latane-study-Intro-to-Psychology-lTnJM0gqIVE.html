85% of those who thought they were alone
in her choking tried to help next 62%
who thought they were in a group with
others when they heard the person
choking tried to help now Darlene latane
did many different variations of this
study and one of the main take-home
findings that they found was that in all
cases as group size increased the number
of people trying to help decreased in
this experiment then when the
participants perceived that there were
more people who heard the person choking
they were less likely to help however
when the participant thought that they
were the only one who heard the person
choking they were more likely to help
this demonstrates the basic principle
that as group size increased the number
of people trying to help decreased</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
