for gravitational potential energy but
in the previous video I discussed how
this formula is actually more accurate
but it's strange because these formulas
actually look quite different for
example the distance away from the
ground H here is in the numerator
whereas in this equation the distance
away from the center of the earth are
down here is in the numerator that seems
awfully strange and this one is positive
and this one's negative there are quite
a few differences so the question is can
these values really be similar so we're
going to use do a problem where we're
going to have to use both these formulas
and we're going to see if we get similar
results over small distances and then
we're going to calculate the percent
error by using this equation instead of
this one so let's imagine we have a
person here who's dropping a
one-kilogram ball off a 50 meter tall
building now it turns out that this one
kilogram mass doesn't actually matter to
the final calculation but we'll just
throw it in there just to make our lives
easier I want you to solve for the
kinetic energy of the ball at the bottom
of this building using both of these
forms of gravitational potential energy
then once you've calculated the final
kinetic energy using both of these
formulas I want you to tell me what's
the percent error using mgh instead of
this more general formula you should put
your answer in this box and in order to
solve this problem you may need a few of
these constants down below here's the
value of G here's the radius of the
earth in kilometers and here's the mass
of the Earth in kilograms and just as a
hint to get you started in the right
direction when you're using this formula
this R should be the radius of the earth
when the ball is at the bottom of the
building and should be equal to the
radius of the earth plus 50 meters when
the ball is at the top of the building
remember that this formula is from the
ball to the center of the earth so we
have to include the radius of the earth
in our calculations also when you're
solving this problem be sure to use g
equals 9.8 meters per second squared
rather than 10 meters per second squared
just to make our answer a bit more
accurate all right good luck finding
that percent error</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
