what's going on here so going back to
the formula for a second remember all
the the clauses end up being in these
these groups so there's one clause for
each node that says that that node has
to have one of the K colors so that's
going to total up to n clauses in the
formula then for each pair of colors we
have to exclude that they're both true
for every node so this is for every node
for every pair of colors in the node
there's a clause so for every node for
every pair of colors there's a clause
alright and that covers making sure that
there's a color assignment that makes
sense then for each color for each edge
in the graph we have a clause that
excludes that that color is shared on
both ends of that graph so that's for
each color for each edge we have a
clause so that ends up being the total
there's no other no other clauses that
we need to consider here that captures
the notion of K color ability so we can
just plunk these numbers in 8 plus 8
times 3 times 2 divided by 2 is 3 3
times 20 is 60 92 that's what I get but
the important thing that I wanted you to
get at is this this formula here which
most importantly is polynomial in the
size of the graph so we have a graph of
a given size that from that we generate
a formula and the formula has a given
size and that size is polynomial so
that's that's good because then when we
run it imagine that we have some kind of
satisfiability algorithm that runs in
polynomial time it's running on a
polynomial sized input so it's not like
we're running a polynomial time
algorithm on an exponential sized input
which will take exponential time to run
this way it really does run in
polynomial time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
