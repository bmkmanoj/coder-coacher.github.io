assigning some variables that I already
knew so the height being 8 is just kind
of a default value for the height of a
basement it could have been seven it
could have been nine anything that's
tell enough that we can fit it it is
fine for the total width and the total
length we were actually given those over
here in the requirements the length is
44 in the width is 30 those are set by
the other floors of the house and the
basement just kind of mimics their
footprint so what I did next was then I
just went ahead and took the
requirements for the utility closet and
the stairwell and went ahead and applied
them I just said that they've see tility
closet and stairwell must each be a
hundred square feet let's just keep
things simple and go ahead and assign
those to ten by ten for each similarly
for the bathroom at the bath there must
be at least 200 square feet and no
length or width can be under 10 feet
let's just make it 10 by 20 that's
pretty easy after assigning those three
rooms we had 920 square feet left so I
decided to keep things simple here as
well split it into two rooms that are
each 460 square feet and one way to do
that would be to make them each 20 x 23
so some of you might notice that these
rooms don't actually map to the 44 x 30
basement because while the areas of
these rooms add up to the same number of
square feet they aren't configurable
into the right arrangement for the
purposes of this example we'll leave it
at the numbers but a real configuration
exercise for this would also involve
arranging the rooms such that not only
do they add to the same number square
feet but they can physically fit inside
the same rectangle thank you David
there's several things to note from
David's analysis one is that in
configuration finally we want an
arrangement of all the components of all
the parts so in this case finally we
want an arrangement of all the rooms and
stables in the utility closet and so on
not just the size of each one of them
where the actual spatial layout second
David began by assigning values to some
variables here because he thought that
these variables were more restricted one
can use a number of different heuristics
for ordering the variables but as we can
choose those variables which are most
restricted first or we can choose those
variables that restrict others the most
first we can choose the most important
variables first the point is that they
can be a large number of variables and
we can impose an ordering on them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
