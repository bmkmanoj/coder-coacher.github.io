mechanism here and in the specification
file and the generators for generating
variants can you give me an idea of the
kind of variants that might apply in
this forecasting situation sure so we we
already showed an example of the most
common case which is what we call a
batch forecaster one that generates
forecasts for all the locations and
products that pertain to a given
retailer some other variants on that are
we might want to generate forecasts not
in batch right not down in the database
where they're materialized and kept we
might want to generate them on demand is
we may just want to say all right well
rather than having to wait for the
weekly or the nightly reef or cast of
everything I might want to quickly
regenerate a forecast for some
particular product or some particular
set of products and I don't want to I
don't want to store that result in the
database I just want to get a get an
answer we call that on demand
forecasting is this is this something
that somebody at one of your clients
might formulate as a query yes yes in
fact in in several of our clients who
use this service they have existing
systems where they need to be able to
get an on demand forecast because they
had traditionally integrated with other
systems that did on demand forecasting
so we have to package up a service for
just that and that service has to
involve all the same algorithms that we
use to do a batch forecast but it's
deployed slightly differently so that's
an example batch versus on demand
another example is as that may have
alluded to previously users forecasters
that is the actual employees at one of
our retail clients will often want to
make adjustments or or do some what-if
analysis by tweaking the inputs to our
forecasting algorithms to try to see if
they can get forecasts that look more in
line with what they've seen historically
that's not used a lot but it is
something that is is needed and so the
ability to do variants that will allow
for user adjust
and for tweaking of inputs is another
common class of variants I think in this
particular day in the first application
we build the first forecast manager
application we built at least eight
different variants of the of the
forecaster and I may be missing a few we
may have made even some some different
ones that we used in order to test that
capability and do the accuracy
assessment so clearly you get a lot of
different variants I mean 888 a lot
right if you would want to implement
eight of these from scratch you need to
do something to manage that variation
and can you show us what an assembly
spec for one of these variants might
look like so if you look at the slide
that's that's being depicted now this is
the hello world assembly spec that we
were looking at a moment ago and this is
a new one a variant that I'm calling
gutentag veldt it's a variant of hello
world that allows for forecast
adjustment and if you look at this
assembly spec you'll notice a couple of
things so first it's it's not exactly
the same as hello world it's got some
new components a new interface and a new
refinement in particular there's the the
mods component that implements a new
interface called overrides that
represent some of the adjustment
overrides that uh that a user of the
system might want to make if they're
tweaking the inputs to the forecasts and
in order to see the effects there's also
a new refinement called dampener which
allows multipliers to be dampened by
these overrides so typically in these
applications one common adjustment
scenario is to go in and allow the users
to change by some percentage the
multipliers that our forecasts are
calculated to compute uplift so that
they can see its impact on the on the
final forecasts and so what that
dampener refinement there is doing is
it's applying those those overrides by
virtue of being parameterised by that
mods component two multipliers to give
us another implementation another
component that implements the
multipliers interface and we can then
use that in the same two refinements
that we saw previously in hello world in
current forecast and the the output of
this thing is the last line the the you
have a batch but it's an adjusted badge
that's right our application that you
built exactly exactly and it's a
different component so we could actually
put both of these in the install both of
these into our database if we wanted to
and then we would have a batch
forecaster and a batch adjusted
forecaster if we so desire</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
