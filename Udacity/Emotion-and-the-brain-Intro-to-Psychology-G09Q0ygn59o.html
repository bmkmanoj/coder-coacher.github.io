the brain as well as in the body there
are particular brain regions that are
involved in the experience and
expression of emotion more than any
other brain structure the amygdala is
active in controlling emotional
experience especially fear it's been
shown that people who have damage to the
amygdala don't actually show fear
relatedly psychopaths people who are
cold and remorseless individuals who
deceive and lie their way through life
often have abnormally small
malfunctioning amygdala in addition some
violent criminals have been shown to
have tumors on their amygdala the
amygdala is also involved in recognizing
fear in other people based on their
facial expressions but not other
emotions in addition it's important to
note the left prefrontal cortex is most
active when experiencing positive
emotions such as joy or happiness
however on the other hand the right
prefrontal cortex is most active when we
experience negative emotions such as
fear sadness and when we experience
pleasure the hypothalamus is active</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
