quickly with the help of a little
program like before I've got this
mailing function and I'm gonna make an
empty graph with 256 nodes which is
gonna be arranged as a grid a number of
nodes per row and column on a side here
is the square root of n or 16 and then
we're gonna do is we're gonna run
through all the pairs of nodes in the
graph I and J and for each one if it's
not on the very edge we're gonna make a
link well if it's not on the bottom edge
then we're gonna make the link downward
and if it's not on the right edge we're
gonna make a link to the right that's
gonna build our grid so we print out the
number of edges in this graph that we
created and we get 480 we could do that
kind of by reasoning as well that just
like in this great example before the
sequence the little chain that we have
going across is the number of nodes in a
column minus 1 and there are five of
them because there's five rows so in
this case there'll be 16 of them it'll
be 16 chains at length 15 across the
downward ones are going to be the same
so we'll just double that and we also
get 4 td that way so if you're nice to
be able to answer this question in a
little bit more generality so how many
edges do we have in a good graph and
we're assuming that there are n nodes
and the nodes are arranged in a square
so the picture of that looks like this
where you have nodes arranged in a
square but this to make sense we're
assuming that N is a perfect square so
that we can actually arrange the nodes
and form a square as so so there's route
and nodes on each of the sides and if we
fill in the edges these green edges
what's the total amount that we get well
the same basic idea as we use last time
applies that is the number of edges that
go across in a chain here is going to be
root n minus 1 and that's going to be
repeated for each of these rows and
gonna get the same kind of analysis for
the edges that are going down so what is
that that's 2 n minus 2 root N and does
that give us the right answer when n is
256
yes well that's good</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
