slope-intercept form now which is great
but it's kind of yucky looking at least
if you're me and fractions aren't
necessarily your favorite thing there is
however yet another form of a linear
equation that we can use to rewrite this
and maybe make it look a little bit more
pleasing and that is called the general
form of a linear equation we can write a
general form of the general form for
linear equations as ax plus B Y equals C
where a B and C are all constants in
addition to this we have one more little
requirement one thing that's not allowed
is for a and B to both be equal to zero
if that was the case of course this term
would be 0 and this term would be 0 as
well so we would just end up with the
equation 0 plus 0 equals 0 which may be
true but isn't a linear equation because
there are no variables in it what the
general form does then is basically show
up everything of the variable to one
side of the equation and shove all of
the constant terms to the other side of
the equation and then of course combine
whatever constants you have into one
number so let's play around with this
since the coefficient in front of Y
doesn't have to be one it can be some
other constant in general form let's get
rid of these fractions what I'd like you
to do then is to multiply both sides of
this equation by some number so that
there are no more fractional
coefficients or constant terms
try however to make this number you
multiply both sides by the smallest
number that you could use to get rid of
the fractions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
