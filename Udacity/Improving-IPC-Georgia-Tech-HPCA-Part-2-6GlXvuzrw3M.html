at how to improve the IPC without a
further execution and how to design
actual hardware that does that for
improving the IPC we have seen that the
ILP can be good it can be significantly
larger than one usually it's way over
four but to achieve something close to
the tile P we need to handle the control
dependences and we have seen how branch
prediction can help eliminate control
dependencies if branch prediction is
correct so if your branch friction is
very good which on today's processors it
is then as far as control dependencies
are concerned our IP C will be very
close to the ILP then we have to
consider the write after write and write
after read data dependencies also known
as false dependencies and we have seen
that a technique called register
renaming can completely eliminate these
dependencies so that you simply don't
have them anymore in your program at
which point they are not going to be a
problem for our IPC and then we have
seen that there are these write after
read also known as true data
dependencies and we have seen that it
helps a lot when you can execute
instructions out of order
meaning you don't strictly follow the
program order you simply find
instructions whose inputs are ready and
you execute them then that is how I'll
be mostly was good and finally there are
these structural dependencies which is
when you cannot execute things simply
because you don't have enough resources
in the processor but that can be solved
simply by investing the number into a
wider issue processor meaning we need a
processor that can handle a bunch of
instructions in each cycle and not have
to delay instructions just because it
doesn't have resources for it so among
these we really need to figure out how
to do these three and first we will
focus on this so how do we actually do
register renaming and out of order
execution in a way that can be amenable
to hardware implementation so we know
how to do it kind of manually on paper
but how does the processor actually do
it so this lesson will really focus on
how to do this for real</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
