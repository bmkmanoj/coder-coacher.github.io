we did row plays what does roleplay
return well it's a set of plays where
each play is a I word pair where I is
the index into the row where the word
starts eventually want to get all plays
before we can get there I'm going to
introduce another function called
horizontal plays which does wrote plays
across all the possible rose but only
going in the across direction not in the
down direction and that'll take a hand
and a board as input a board is just a
list of rows and will return a set of
plays where a play like in a row play is
a position and a word except now the
position is not going to just be I the
position is an IJ pair so it's going to
be at this column in this row along with
the word so it's a set of tuples that
look like that so let's define
horizontal plays well you know the drill
by now familiar structure we start out
with an empty set of results we're going
to build them up somehow and then get
the results and now how are we going to
do that let's enumerate over all the
rose in the board and we just want the
good ones the one from won 2-1 we don't
want the rose at the top and the bottom
which are off the board are the border
squares so for each good row I'm going
to write a function called set anchors
which takes the row and modifies that
row mutates the road to have all the
anchors in it remember before when I
called row plays I passed in manually
all the anchors here I'm going to have
the program do it for me and now for
each word I want to find all the plays
with in that row and properly add them
in to results I want to do something
with row plays of hand with in that row
and I want you to tell me what code
should go here could be a single line or
it could be a loop over the results to
come back from row plays figure out what
goes here so that we can return the
proper results</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
