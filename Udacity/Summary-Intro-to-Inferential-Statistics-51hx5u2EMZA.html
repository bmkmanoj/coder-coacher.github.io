what you learned in Lesson seven so he
started with a population in this case
Klout scores the number in this
population was 1048 the mean Klout score
was thirty seven point seven two and the
population standard deviation was about
sixteen point oh four then we know from
the central limit theorem that if we
took all possible samples all of the
same size and then found the mean of
each sample and then graphed the
distribution of those sample means we
would get a normal curve with a mean
equal to the population mean and a
standard deviation equal to the
population standard deviation divided by
the square root of the sample size
remember that this is called the
sampling distribution in lesson seven we
specifically looked at the sampling
distribution created from all samples of
size 35 so if we take all samples of
size 35 from this population we find the
mean of each sample and then we plot the
distribution of sample means the mean of
the means will be the same as the
population mean and the standard
deviation of this distribution is the
population standard deviation divided by
the square root of 35 which came out to
about 2.7 1 remember also that the
standard deviation of the sampling
distribution is called the standard
error now if we plot this sampling
distribution it'll look something like
this one standard deviation away from
the mean would be thirty seven point
seven two plus two point seven one and
minus two point seven one so we know
what the distribution should look like
of all sample means of size 35 so then
we said what if we get this sample of
size 35 and the mean is 40 and everyone
in this sample uses the app the Bieber
tweeter the first part of this lesson is
all about estimating what the mean Klout
score would be if everyone started to
use the Bieber tweeter</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
