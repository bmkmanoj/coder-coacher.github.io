structures for technical interviewing my
name is Brynn and I'll be your guide in
mentor my job is to teach you how to
invent efficient solutions to unsolved
problems using algorithms and data
structures a skill you need both in a
job and to get a job algorithm is a
fancy word for something straightforward
a program that solves a problem at the
start of this course algorithms might
seem a bit like a magic trick
you see the input to the trick and you
see the output from the trick but
everything that happens in the middle
seems pretty mystical my goal is to
teach you the steps involved with the
trick and to explain what resources
you'll need to pull off the trick in
this analogy the resources are often
data structures or a common pattern in
the problem after I've given you all the
tools you'll need we'll do a little
practice to make sure you're ready to
pull off the tricks and technical
interviews however it's not my intention
to discuss every little detail like the
laws of physics or what each tool is
made out of at the molecular level
you'll be able to apply algorithms to
problems you'll face at work or in an
interview but not use them at the level
of a mathematician in a real technical
interview you just need to show that you
can successfully perform the trick and
that you understand the concepts behind
it I'm also not trying to explain every
concept that could potentially show up
in an interview I've designed this
course to explain topics that show up
most often but you should definitely use
this course as a starting place and
continue to explore on your own I should
also note that I'm not expecting any
prior exposure to algorithms or data
structures just having the will to learn
you should have some familiarity with
our programming language and have
written some working code with it before
if you want to understand the practice
problems that go along with the videos
but soon I'll make sure we're on the
same page about exactly what that means</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
