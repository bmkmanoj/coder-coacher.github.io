classes and what they are and classes
are part of something called
object-oriented programming it's a
really big topic you could easily spend
a club an entire course or two or three
on just object-oriented programming
Steve just recommended you look at the
docs will link to the docks a lot of
people weren't satisfied with that
there's really not any way for us to
deal with object-oriented programming in
any kind of complete way in this course
basically a class is a way to organize
variables functions and other pieces of
data in Python or another object
oriented programming language such that
you can pass them around and that you
have different spaces of names so that
you don't have multiple variables of the
same name conflicting with each other
there is a lot more to it but we don't
think that we're going to have to deal
with that that much and you shouldn't
have to know too much about it again
we're going to link to the docks if you
really want to know about it I would
recommend reading them there they're not
too bad they might be beyond some of you
depending on what your background is but
we're hopefully going to be offering
some more material on that in future
courses so if you'd like to know more
about that I'd recommend sticking around
for that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
