say what does this have to do with
computer vision what does this have to
do with vision I'm so glad you asked
alright well another way of phrasing
what we've been doing is given some
sequence of observations which model was
most likely to have generated those so
using our previous a clothing and
whether example so suppose you're seeing
some sequence of clothing right so you
check the clothing that people are
wearing each day and you see this code
code whatever and then the question you
want to ask is is this Philadelphia
Boston or newark the idea is that
presumably what you've been doing is
you've been collecting sequences of
these observations from Philadelphia a
bunch of them from Boston a budget from
Newark you have trained a model and
we'll talk about that later you've
created a model that will tend to
generate sequences like you see in
Philadelphia or in boston or newark with
the same statistics that they have and
then given some new observation sequence
you'd like to say you know which one is
this now notice that if we were checking
boston vs arizona you basically wouldn't
need the sequence it doesn't rain in
arizona for the most part and you can
say well do I see umbrellas ok and since
it's always lousy weather in boston i
live there if you see bathing suits you
know it's actually Cape Cod so the idea
is you know just from the individual
elements themselves you could determine
whether it was Boston or Arizona the
whole idea of representing the time
series is that there's something about
the sequentiality that matters it's the
statistics of one thing following
another that is indicative of the actual
class and what you're doing is you're
building some models of those time
series so you can then given some
observation sequence you can say which
ones most likely and what we're going to
do is we're going to apply that to
computer vision</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
