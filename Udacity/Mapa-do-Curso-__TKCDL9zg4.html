getting there earthquake data from the
USGS earthquake catalogue API and we've
got some polished user interface designs
for our app from our designer which
means we're ready to get started so
let's talk about the journey will be
referring to this course map to track
our progress in lesson 1 we'll explore
the usgs site and figure out how to
request the data that our app needs
we'll also learn about the structure in
which the data is returned to us and
compose a plan for extracting that data
programmatically in code in lesson two
we'll start to unpack the concepts you
need to understand in order to get
information from the internet into an
android app things like permissions on
Android and doing work on a background
threat in lesson 3 we'll dive into the
heart of the networking topic and you'll
understand the end-to-end path of an
HTTP request then we'll update our quake
report app to request data from the USGS
in real-time and display the most recent
earthquakes in the world within the app
okay let's take a closer look at lesson
1 in this lesson we'll start building up
our quick report app in incremental
stages after you spend some time
familiarizing yourself with the USGS API
will begin to prepare our app to handle
the earthquake Information we're
interested in displaying you'll import
some code that we provided to get you
started and practice becoming familiar
with the code base next you'll get some
focused java practice by writing some
utility functions that'll be key to
extracting and formatting the metadata
that we want to display about each
earthquake in our list you'll then
transition to learning about how to
properly parse the JSON structure
contained in the HTTP response from the
server and to do this we'll take a
sample response and copy and paste it
into the app pretending that we got the
response from the internet in the latter
half of the lesson we'll update the list
item layout to display the key meta
information about each quake things like
the magnitude location details date and
time this will mostly be a review of
concepts from the last course but this
will form a nice foundation so we can
dive deeper into networking on Android
shortly after we've got a lot to cover
but after completing this lesson we hope
that you'll feel comfortable exploring
the internet for external data resources
and approaching a Web API to figure out
how to request data using it let's get
started</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
