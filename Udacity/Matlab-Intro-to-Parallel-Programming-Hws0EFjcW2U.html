I'm most excited about is MATLAB many of
you probably already know about MATLAB
especially if you're a scientist or an
engineer MATLAB is a high-level
programming language and development
environment that's designed for
scientific numeric and mathematical
computations scientists and engineers
use MATLAB all the time for algorithm
development data analysis and
visualization and mathematical modeling
MATLAB supports GPU computing in a
couple of ways by allowing MATLAB code
to be executed on a GPU as well as by
providing a way to interface with custom
CUDA code we're going to explore these
features using an application that fits
the theme of this class an image
processing application called white
balancing the white balance operation is
used to adjust the tints of a photograph
so you can see here if this is the
before image after a white balance
operation might look like this and you
can see that we've removed the sort of
reddish tint from the image so this is a
simple example of the kind of operation
that you might implement in MATLAB it's
easy to implement as you'll see and as
you'll see it's also easy to use the GPU
as well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
