meets these three requirements and it
seems in a way like a computer should be
able to do that doesn't it I mean the
input is fit for a computer the output
is fit for computer we have even been
very very nitpicky with finite strings
constant number of symbols and we want
an objectively correct and definitive
answer no grading students essays no
predicting the future no looking at
pictures and telling us if they're
beautiful I'm now going to show you a
problem that meets these three criteria
I will also be able to show you that no
computer can ever solve it and this is
actually a problem where it would be
very useful to have a computer being
able to solve it so I guess you've all
been in this situation here where on
your computer you're working and you've
just started a certain type of
calculation or task on the computer the
computer tells you yes I'm ten percent
done then after a while this moves to 20
percent after a while it moves to thirty
percent and of course depending on what
system you're working on your mouse
turns into this hourglass here and now
the progress bar gets stuck and it stays
there you go have lunch you come back
and it stays there so the question is at
some point in time I mean you want this
task to get done but maybe in the next
minute the computer will will go on
maybe it's it's just thinking it's just
working but it could of course also have
also be that your program has crashed a
few computer stays that way for quite a
time you probably would assume that it
has crashed but you never know for sure
so what if we had an algorithm for that
what if we had an algorithm that took as
input a computer program P it could be
written in any language basically so
Python C++ Java or whatnot
and of course we also wanted input for
that program and the input of course in
accordance with rule number one will be
a finite string using a constant number
of symbols and actually the program of
course will be as well so it may be for
example the source code of a program we
want this algorithm to tell us if we run
the program on the input does the
computer ever finish or does it go into
an infinite loop very simple question
and of course this problem
totally conforms with all three
requirements here so as I just said the
input is a finite string constant number
of symbols perfect out
it's a decision problem so the output
will either be yes or no and of course
the output is also objectively correct
because we're talking about
deterministic machines here so you can
easily check if the program indeed will
go into an infinite loop if the computer
tells you where the problem is and this
problem is known as the famous and it's
really famous halting problem</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
