it so let's say how can we represent the
idea that we have an uncertain ending
well one way would be if we had some
kind of generic probability distribution
over the number of rounds that the games
going to be played but this seemed like
an the simplest idea that I could think
of so we here here we have our two
criminals and what they're going to do
is they're going to play a round of
prisoner's dilemma but at the end of
that round they're gonna flip a coin and
with probability 1 minus gamma that will
be the last round it's all over
but with probability gamma they're
actually gonna play again and they do
this after each round and so each round
is is basically statistically
independent of the other round actually
so the setup here is with probability
gamma the game continues now notice that
I chose gamma here this was it's
representing a probability here but in
the past we've used this to represent a
discount factor mm-hmm but that actually
is the same thing right in in in the
normal discounting we say that the value
that you get one step from now is
discounted downward by gamma and that's
exactly what you take if you worked out
the expected value of a game where you
continue making steps with probability
gamma and with probability one minus
gamma it ends and you get zero from then
until the rest of time so every round
here could be your last or not right it
could be that you actually get to
continue playing does that make some
sense that makes perfect sense
awesome all right so so yeah so this is
this is exactly that kind of situation
where well here let me let me ask you a
question what's the expected number of
rounds of this game well I'll bet it's
finite if gamma is less than 1 yes I
even wrote that down yeah I'm smart or
at least I can read sure but what's the
but specifically we can actually write
it as a as a function of gamma let's see
if gamma were something like 99% then I
would expect it to be about a hundred
right that's right yeah so is that is
that your answer my function of gamma is
if gamma is 0.99 the answer is 100 yeah
fun Billy then it's not a total function
but it's a function well it's a sample I
mean you do machine learning why don't
you tell me what the function would be
given that sample well we can make it a
quiz or I could just tell you won't you
just tell me all right
so one over one minus gamma is the
answer it works for your example one
minus point 99 is one hundredth and
we're talking one over that so that you
get a hundred and yeah we could go
through the argument as to why that's
that's what it is but this one over one
minus gamma is what shows up all the
time if gamma is zero then we're talking
about 1 over 1 the game last one round
that's exactly what we'd expect mm-hmm
gamma gets closer and closer to 1 this
prop this quantity is getting closer and
closer to infinity so in fact if you
know it becomes unbounded as gamma hits
1 so yeah so this is the expected number
of rounds and so that means like yeah so
as you said if gamma is 0.99 it's a
hundred rounds and we already reasoned
that at a hundred rounds the whole thing
falls apart right huh and I noticed the
1 over 1 minus gamma of course is just
like the way we did discount factors
when we started doing NDP's in the first
place
exactly yeah that's that that kind of
links them together hmm that's actually
kind of neat</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
