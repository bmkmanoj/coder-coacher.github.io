about before you start writing code go
ahead and download the starter code
project for my favorite movies and then
open up the info.plist file believe it's
located in supporting files and photos
remember how we had to modify the
info.plist file in the image request app
this accounted for images that used HTTP
instead of HTTP well as of now the movie
database also relies on HTTP to actually
make some of its requests for images and
such and to adhere to Apple's 80s
standards this just won't cut it so
we've made some changes to the info dot
plist file and will collapse out the app
transport security settings and let's
just collapse all these so you can see
everything instead of allowing arbitrary
loads like we did in the image request
app and remember this looked like I
think we'd go here allow arbitrary loads
yes so this property we've gotten rid of
we don't need this property anymore to
do this we've used the exception domains
dictionary which in itself contains
dictionaries for each domain that the
API uses and for each domain we can
specify that we want to allow it to use
insecure HTTP loads I know some of these
key value pairs you haven't seen before
but it's not really important that I get
into all of them right now
the only one that I want to point out is
NS includes subdomains this key provides
a boolean that says whether or not you
want settings of a domain say like cloud
front net to apply to all of its
subdomains a sub domain is an extension
to a domain name that's used to organize
resources together for instance
udacity.com is a domain and it has the
sub domain review dot udacity.com
unreviewed udacity.com you'll find
webpages images and other resources that
are related to Udacity project reviews
so if we were to set NS includes
subdomains to guess for udacity.com and
our info dot plist file that means we'd
want to extend any settings of
udacity.com to all its subdomains like
review dot udacity.com
discussions Udacity duck
and any others I just wanted to make you
aware that these properties have been
updated for my favorite movies if you
want to read more about these properties
the ones that you can use for ATS I've
posted a link in the instructor notes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
