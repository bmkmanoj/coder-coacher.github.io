observer down here Andy who's standing
two meters away but who's one meter
above the ground will look just as tall
as this church 90 meters away so the
trick to solving this problem is to
realize that an order for the building
and Andy to look at the same height from
the observers perspective down here we
have to be able to connect a line that
goes from the top of the building
through Andy's head and finally ends at
the observers eyes and when we draw
these lines corresponding to the height
of the building and the height of Andy
we get these nice similar triangles now
we don't know anything about the angles
of these triangles accept the fact that
these are right angles but we don't need
to remember that with similar triangles
we have this nice property that the
ratio of any two corresponding sides of
the smaller triangle and a larger
triangle have to be equal this means
that the ratio of 1 meter to two meters
has to be exactly the same as the ratio
of the height of the church to the
distance the church's away from the
viewpoint of the observer and we can
express this relationship using this
equation here that 1 over 2 is exactly
equal to the height of the building
which I've labeled here with a question
mark over 90 meters and using this
equation to solve for the height of the
building I find that the building is 45
meters off the ground great job</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
