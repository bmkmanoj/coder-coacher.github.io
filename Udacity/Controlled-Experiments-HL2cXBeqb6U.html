holy grail of scientific research in
human subjects research a control
experiment is where we get some
participants randomly assign them to
certain conditions and then treat each
condition in a different way what we do
to each condition is called a treatment
and in each group of participants is
called a condition typically we have a
control condition experimental condition
where the experimental condition is
where we're trying out something that
we're interested in control experiments
give really really nice generalizable
and clean results but they're also very
difficult to do in education usually in
education we're working in real
classrooms where we don't have the power
to randomly assign people and usually we
want to do things that last several
weeks or several months and it's
difficult to control for everything we
were doing controlled experiments but if
you're interested in doing a controlled
experiment in this lesson we'll talk
about the different things you need be
aware of different tools that are
available to you and different things
you need to make sure to control for</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
