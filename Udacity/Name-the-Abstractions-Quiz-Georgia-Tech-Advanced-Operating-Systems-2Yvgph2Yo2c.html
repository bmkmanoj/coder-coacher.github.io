all the abstractions that sit between
these two extremes Google Earth
application that makes magic happen on
the screen and the solid-state physics
the electrons and holes enshrined in
your computer system what are all the
abstractions that sit between these two
extremes what I want you to do in this
quiz is to name as many abstractions as
you can between these two extremes that
I'm showing you to make room for you let
me clear some space I put a box now for
your answer to give you an idea of what
is expected in this question as an
answer let me start you off with naming
the abstraction that sits right on top
of the electrons and holes this is of
course your solid state physics and you
reign in all the randomness in the
movement of the electrons and holes in
the solid state physics with this
abstraction called transistor the
transistor is akin to an on/off switch
now what I want you to do is fill the
rest of this box with all the other
abstractions that sits above transistors
all the way up to the application</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
