manager so I work with our students to
tell everyone about our classes and
support everyone and celebrate our
successes I have an Android it's a janky
it's old and it loses power almost
immediately if you turn the internet on
so I'm offline most of the time so if
I'm lost I will turn on the internet and
I will go on to Google Maps if I really
want to check my email
I'll turn it on but you know it's a it's
a big decision probably my favorite app
is 2048 we recently had a class called
make your own 2048 and I along with
pretty much everyone in the office got
addicted to playing 2048 so I probably
spent like hours in her splake 2048 on
my phone that was definitely worth
losing battery the last app I
uninstalled was Twitter because when I
turned the internet on my phone
Twitter is a total energy hog and will
not let any other app do anything until
it's updated like all 80 million tweets
that Udacity has gotten in the mean time
so it literally kills my phone so I had
to take it off I install it every now
and then if I need to tweet from my
phone but in general I can tweet from
other devices</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
