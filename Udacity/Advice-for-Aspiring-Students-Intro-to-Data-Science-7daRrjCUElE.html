into this field of data science is my
passion for something specific which is
natural language right so I I observe
the people who work around me who knows
about data science I think one thing
that's very important is they either
have like a passion for the particular
data they're looking at like you know
natural language or like speech
recognition kind of data or some people
are just very interested in patterns in
data like when they see some kind of
some data they would just like try to
calculate you know like the mean of data
the variance of theta it comes natural
to them because they want to find
patterns to data so I think for anyone
who wants to become a data scientist
it's good to think about what kind of
data you are interested in doing and
start with that and then later on when
you have the skill of analyzing data you
can apply it to any other kind of thing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
