computer can do just about anything but
even the craziest computer CPU is only
have about eight cores these days which
isn't nearly enough to render a complex
scene in real time fortunately your
computer and phone also has a graphics
processing unit or GPU GPUs are chips
purpose-built to pump out pixels and
some can have thousands of course each
of these cores is pretty limited in what
it can do though and groups of these
cores have to work together in lockstep
each executing the same instructions
each clock cycle so while the GPU is
less flexible in the CPU it can spew out
pixels at some absurd rate so the code
we run on the CPU determines what we
want to draw and then we send those
instructions over to the GPU which will
actually figure out the pixel colors to
do this we need a language for
communicating between the CPU and the
GPU the most common language for this
purpose is called the open graphics
language or OpenGL smartphones use a
slightly scaled-down version of this
language called OpenGL ES where the II S
stands for embedded systems if in the
Microsoft universe you've ever heard of
DirectX that's a language that serves
essentially the same purpose so to sum
up the CPU uses OpenGL to tell the GPU
what to draw the GPU builds up the
actual array of colors and then ships it
to the electronics that run the screen
brief aside I'd be failing as a nerd if
I didn't mention that you can actually
do far more with GPUs than just color
pixels there's a whole field of
general-purpose GPU computing algorithms
that run on GPUs need to be very clever
about how they get those lock stepping
cores to work together but when they do
they can be extremely fast and as is
often even more important these days
extremely energy efficient in terms of
power per calculation</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
