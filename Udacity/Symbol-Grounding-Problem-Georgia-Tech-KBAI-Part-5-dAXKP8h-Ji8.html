discussion so far content deals with the
content of knowledge and coding deals
with the representation of knowledge
content and form the content of
knowledge could be visual spatial that
deals with what and who here where is
spatial what is visual and the encoding
for visuospatial knowledge could be
either an illogical or propositional
analogical encoding of visuospatial
knowledge it is a structural
correspondence between the encoding and
the external world that is being
represented in the propositional
representation of visuospatial knowledge
there is no such correspondence examples
of this verbal knowledge include things
like scripts for going to a restaurant
the script for going to a restaurant
again can be represented either
propositional e or potentially a
neurologically in a proposition
representation of the kind we saw we may
have cracks and props and actors and
neurological representation of the
script will go into a restaurant we may
have a short movie and much of the
course we have dealt with the right-hand
side of this chart with verbal knowledge
and propositional presentations part of
the point of this lesson and
visuospatial knowledge and reasoning is
that reasoning and knowledge can be
visual spatial and the representations
can be analogical but we have yet to
fully understand your role in human
cognition and we certainly are yet to
Bellaire agents that can deal with
visual special knowledge and analogical
representations</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
