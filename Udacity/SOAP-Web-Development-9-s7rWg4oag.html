about is soap actually I'm just kidding
we are not going to talk about soap soap
is based on XML another protocol for
communicating between two machines if
you ever have to deal with it you'll
know why that I don't even want to
bother teaching it it's very very
complicated but what I would like to
list for you are a bunch of other common
protocols and formats for communicating
across the internet you know soap is one
of them we won't be spending any time on
any of these but lots of people use them
for example hipmunk a lot of our data
sources communicate via soap is invented
by Microsoft to make communication
online as complicated as possible you've
got protocol buffers sure from google
it's similar in concept to json it's a
way of encoding different types of data
for sending it over the wire there's
another one called thrift this is by
Facebook you know you've got all sorts
of like plain text plus them formats now
these are not all you know soap kind of
defines a whole protocol protocol
buffers are really you know how to
encode data thrift us how to encode that
over the wire these these compare more
to JSON soap compares more to http plus
JSON kind of the whole package the
protocol and that the data type of
course you can always just build your
own plain text you know protocol and
data format but I wouldn't recommend
doing this it's not that hard to just
use JSON instead and then you know
somebody else who comes along and needs
the user service whether it's you know
outside of your company or internally
they don't have to figure out you know
how to you know write all this custom
code to parse parse your custom stuff
you guys JSON and thrift and protocol
buffers and soap you can find
implementations of these in almost any
language we mentioned XML and JSON those
are also in this list use something that
already exists it will save everybody a
lot of time and probably wouldn't you so</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
