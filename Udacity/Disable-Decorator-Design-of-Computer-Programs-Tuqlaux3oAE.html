want to say about decorators I wanted to
add one more debug tool and that's one
i'm going to call disabled and it's very
simple disabled is another name for the
identity function that is the function
that returns its argument without doing
any computation on it whatsoever why do
I want it and why do I call it disabled
well the idea is that if I'm using some
of these debugging tools like trace or
account calls I might have scattered
throughout my program trace define F and
some other traced functions and that I
might decide I think I'm okay now I
think I've got it debugged and I don't
want to trace any more and then what i
can do is i can just say trace equals
disabled and reload my program and now
the decorator trace will be applied to
the function but what it will do is
return the function itself so notice we
don't have to say that disabled is a
decorator even though we're using it as
if it were one because it doesn't create
a new function it just returns the
original function and so that way we
won't have the output the trace output
cluttering up our output and the
function will be efficient there won't
even be a test to see if we are tracing
or not it'll just use the exact function
that was passed in</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
