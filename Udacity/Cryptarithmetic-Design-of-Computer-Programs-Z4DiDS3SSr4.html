a different type of puzzle this is
called a crypt arithmetic problem crypt
for cryptography secret writing and
arithmetic for arithmetic doing addition
and other types of problems and the idea
here is that each of these letters of
the alphabet stands for some digit from
0 to 9 and the problem is to figure out
which digit stands for which such that
the equation will be correct some people
call these alpha medics is another name
for them there are a problem or a puzzle
for humans to work out because there's
so many possibilities and humans are
limited in the speed in which they can
work them out but there's some types of
inferences that that they can make for
example in this addition problem here we
have an addition problem of two
three-digit numbers and the result is a
four digit number and E is that fourth
digit so what does that tell us about
what the digit what the letter e must
stand for what digit it must stand for
do you think e should be one or two or
three or four or nine</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
