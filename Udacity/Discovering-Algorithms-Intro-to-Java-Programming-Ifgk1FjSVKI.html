parts for the second half so I can tell
them apart here's the other half of my
array now what could I do it looks like
it would be helpful if I could swap
these two elements because that way i
would get this element in place and also
this one let's do it again that's good
now these two elements are in place and
so are these another swap and another
and another and pressed I'm done I have
what used to be the second half now in
the first half what used to be in the
first half now the second half in
exactly the right order well that's
great now I can start writing pseudocode
so which elements did I swap the one in
position 0 and 5 1 and 6 2 and 7 3 and 8
4 &amp;amp; 9 so each time I swapped position I
with position I plus 5 what's five
that's the length of each sub array or
one half the length of the original
array so I started at zero we'll figure
out in a minute how far it went and then
I swapped the element at position I with
what I can't say I plus 5 in the pseudo
code because the pseudocode needs to
explain the general situation so it was
length over to now how far does I go in
this case it went from zero to four so
in general it'll go to length of a 2-1
now that was the hard part the easy part
is to program that in Java and I'll
leave that to you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
