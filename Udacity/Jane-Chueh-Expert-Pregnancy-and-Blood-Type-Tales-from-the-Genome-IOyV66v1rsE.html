professor at the Stanford Medical School
Medical Center clinically I work as a
high-risk obstetrician which means we
see high-risk pregnancies and I also do
fetal ultrasounds on pregnancies in
general looking for fetal anomalies what
kind of what makes a pregnancy at risk
or high risk well you know every
pregnancy deserves close scrutiny zation
right and so we look at every pregnancy
as if there could be something going on
and so we at every ultrasound we do that
particularly at the 5-month ultrasound
where we carefully go through the people
in a me and so sometimes even if you're
20 years old things can happen that are
unexpected and rare we look at every
fetus with a sort of light there are
other other you know types of conditions
that the mother can have that predispose
them to being high-risk and some of
those are if you're older if you have
diabetes for example or some sort
underlying medical issue like
hypertension so those things are all
play into our our pool of high-risk sure
now we've talked a lot in our lesson up
to this point about how important the
ABO blood type is for our red blood
cells and I'm curious to know how blood
type affects possibly these regular or
high-risk pregnancies so every patient
that we see we do require that we know
their blood type and Rh type and I know
you've talked a lot about the ABO blood
system it's important because at
delivery there's a chance that they may
bleed whether they have a vaginal
delivery or whether they have a
c-section
sometimes a bleed most of time they
bleed very minimally and so they don't
require transfusion but occasionally in
rare cases they have a lot of bleeding
and it becomes a very complicated case
where they require lots of blood if you
need blood then it's important to have
the type of blood that the person
receives match to their type so we we
want to know what that is and in fact we
actually require that they be typed
twice so
type data prenatal visit and they also
type when they come in before they
receive blood so there's two that that
that is important because you can't just
it could be a mistake I mean that one if
they have just one results so the policy
is that there's two that actually
correlate that they're the same if you
don't have a blood type then and you
need blood been the only option is you
know the blood bank gives you universal
donor which would be o-negative
but own egative is not the most common
type of blood there is and you know you
can't use up your entire pool of
o-negative blood so the best thing would
be dude you know get the person that the
type of blood that they actually have
actually I have a match now as you
mentioned that the ABO type is important
but you mentioned another factor a
positive or negative factor yes
so in pregnancy particularly the Rh
factor which is a rhesus blood group on
the red cell is important this refers to
a group of antigens the most common
being the D antigen and there's a D+
group and there's a d- antigen in other
words they're missing the D antigen so
everybody has two alleles right so
they're they could be d+ de positive or
de+ d- or d- d- so it's kind of like
correct exactly exactly so just like
with a blood type you can have
homozygous a which would be a positive a
positive or heterozygous a which would
be a plus Oh a plus oh right or a oh the
rhesus Group also is the same thing so
you can have D plus D plus which would
be homozygous D plus or you can have D
plus D negative which would be
heterozygous D plus or you can have D
negative which be negative DNA
and we'll learn a lot more about
dominance actually in one of our lessons
lesson five where we'll learn that the D
plus allele then is dominant right right
and so this becomes an issue when we
find an Rh negative woman whose neck d-
d- so if she marries a partner who is
not Rh negative in other words he's Rh
positive and he's either d plus d plus
or D plus d negative both of them are
which are considered you know D or Rh
positive then there's a chance that her
child could be Rh positive either D plus
well actually would have to be 100% D
plus D negative right because one of the
genes comes from her and it'll be D
negative and the other one is going to
come from her partner so we need to know
when her partner's genotype is for the
RH antigen and we need to know if the
fetus has you know a hundred percent
chance of being Rh positive which this
fetus would have if the father was
homozygous Rh positive in other words he
had two copies of the D gene that would
a lot that would obviously result in a
fetus that's heterozygous Rh positive
however if the father is heterozygous
and he's D plus D negative then there's
a chance that her fetus will be Rh
negative between D minus D minus and so
just to be clear here then the risk here
is that the mother would be Rh negative
and the babies are each positive correct
and if the mothers and the baby's blood
or to see each other that the mother's
blood might not recognize the Rh
positive and the baby blood and an
attack or something big no B see if the
mother's Rh negative and C's the Rh
positive and the fetus in the fetus
blood fetal blood then it will recognize
it as being foreign cuz she's never seen
the D antigen until she became pregnant
right so what happens
so let's say you you know the scenario
happens what right so what happens is if
if that happens and her antibody screen
will come back positive that she has an
antibody so that antibody would be
against her fetuses D antigen which is
foreign to her and at small titers is
not an issue but with over time the body
has memory and so over time it will
mount at a higher and higher response so
for example usually the first pregnancy
the titers don't get to a point where
they're concerning or that they will
actually destroy the fetal fetal blood
because if once the mother makes so much
antibody against the fetus the the
antibodies will cross and there will
actually Hema lies the fetal blood it'll
attack it'll attack the red cells
because of the foreign antigen on the
fetal blood so essentially what what
you're telling us is that initial so
let's say mother's having her first
pregnancy and she's Rh negative she's D
negative and the babies D positive even
though she may have some antibodies that
might attack it because it's her first
pregnancy there aren't that many
antibodies may be her second or third
right exactly
I see so the first pregnancy what we do
is we find out that she's sensitized
that's what the word is you know when we
find that she has antibodies already
made against the D antigen and we
followed those titers of those
antibodies and there's a critical titer
above which we then we start to get
worried so as long as she's below that
critical titer then we just followed
monthly with blood titers from her once
she rises above that then we have to
start thinking okay is this mother going
to mount is she mounting such a high
response that it's causing fetal anemia
and we actually have ways of looking for
fetal anemia the old-fashioned way was
to put a needle into the pregnancy sac
take out fluid and check for bilirubin
which is a breakdown product of
hemolysis right and there's graphs this
curve called the lightly curve which we
plot the points and based on the
gestational age you find out whether
it's a normal amount of bilirubin or an
abnormal amount which would indicate a
high amount of hemolysis
well that was invasive and you know
people would end up having multiple
amniocentesis over the Pregnant's course
of the pregnancy
and it wasn't that long ago because when
I trained that was the way we treated
sensitized pregnancies but now there's a
non-invasive way of monitoring for fetal
anemia where we use ultrasound to look
at the blood flow in that fetal brain
and what we do is we measure the peak
velocity in the middle cerebral artery
of the fetus and we can tell whether the
fetus is anemic based on the velocity
hello it goes up Ashley should be so
yeah so because if your knee make what
you're trying to do is you're trying to
preserve flow to your most important
organs and obviously the brain is the
most important so it shunts blood there
and you'll have a higher velocity so
that's how and then we have these
elaborate curves now that based on the
flow the peak velocity in the middle
middle cerebral artery we can tell what
the chances that this fetus has anemia
so if it's high chance you know we might
just skip the whole amniocentesis and we
usually do now we don't go with that
because it's so predictive we just go in
and we sample the fetal cord to check
the humanik RIT and if it's low than we
transfuse so we actually get in there
we're ready to transfuse and we used own
negative blood for the fetus that is
matched to the mother's to make sure
there's no antibodies that the fetus
can't handle and we check the crit but
we usually have an idea where it might
be and there's these charts that so if
we find out the hematocrit is 10 or 15
then we know how much to transfuse and
then we check the crit and if it's 10
then we know we have to give this many
cc's of blood so what are besides the
actual mother mother fetus interaction
are there any other important clinical
settings related to this or otherwise
we're knowing blood types really
important just the first one you know
for the mother mostly for her her safety
and it's fishy hemorrhage during
pregnancy and pregnancy or delivery that
she would need blood and there are times
when
I guess patients need a lot of blood or
a little bit of blood I mean is there
ever has ever been a scenario where
you're like oh gosh I need this type of
blood but you know I don't have enough
for yes what do you do so yeah we have
something called a massive transfusion
protocol this happens when there's a
obstetric hemorrhage disaster that
happens usually if you have time you try
to give matched blood and you know the
person's blood type especially if you've
anticipated the possibility and she's
already been crossed and matched but if
not then you know you you activate the
protocol and you give own negative blood
and and we've had cases where due to
certain conditions of the placenta and
the uterus especially one called the
placenta accreta where the placenta
grows into the uterus where you can't
remove the placenta after delivery we
have to remove the entire uterus and
there's so much blood flow that they the
mothers lose so much blood they can
receive you know 50 to 100 units of
blood what would be the reaction I'm
just curious if the wrong blood type was
administered what happens to the patient
so they can have a transfusion reaction
which we'll need to look up in a book I
mean I know I know it's like but it's
basically they get very very sick you
know it they get high fevers they I
think they start humanizing basically
always their blood cells you know and I
know that we can there's a there's a
mild transfusion reaction where you can
prevent a little bit of that by giving
some free medication but then if it's
truly unmatched blood then you could die
from that well that raises it just
automatic it's an interesting question
do you know your blood type I do
it's B+ but I don't remember the
scenario I've never received blood I
think I just asked my parents one time
and they knew but we have people come in
all the time and they don't you know we
do a procedure and we need to know their
blood type
so here's another another scenario we
need to know their blood type I forgot
to mention if you Rh negative so we
can't obviously type every single Rh
negative person you know and what their
fetus is because you don't want to
invasively go in there and check we also
don't need to to check every father and
unless there was
some sort of issue so for all the sort
of the general rh- women they received
something called rhogam during a
pregnancy rhogam is an immunoglobulin
that blocks the antigens on the red
cells so if you might imagine the fetal
cell trying to get into the maternal
circulation if it got in there the
rhogam would just attach itself to all
the sites bind all the sites so the
mother can't see the antigens and you
can't she won't amount that she won't
mount a response so that way if the
fetus happened to be Rh positive
positive that's correct then she won't
see the positive D antigen and so that's
what we use rhogam for rhogam is given
in the middle of pregnancy around 28
weeks on all all Rh negative women just
by the chance that perhaps that fetus
might be always positive how many women
are Rh negative so about 5% of the
Caucasian population in the United
States are large negative so they
receive rhogam at 28 weeks and also
after delivery if the fetus or the
newborn now obviously after delivery is
Rh positive so that she doesn't mount a
response you know by because during
during the delivery process there's some
mixing of blood between the fetus and
the mother
yes we've learned about ABO and sort of
this new antigen are are there other yes
actually there's 202 pages you know very
small print of other antigens that are
on the red cell antigen on the red cell
on the red blood cell and some of them
the most common ones being is Kell kll
for it's it's not common because as it's
most of the population is Kell negative
so it's only an issue if the mother has
somehow received blood from a Kell
positive person and then she saw that as
being foreign and she mounted the Kel
and Kel antibody right because most
people kill negative and they meet
can they get a person and they reproduce
and there's no issue because this
compatibility but if you happen to be
kill negative and have the antibody then
that could be an issue because your
fetus could be killed negative and you
know you can suffer from the fetus could
suffer from that so again we go through
the same thing of monitoring for fetal
anemia if the mother is has the
antibodies to kill so it sounds like
even a pregnancy and even otherwise you
know your blood types could be really
important so we do have people come in
for procedures that like when
amniocentesis and if they're Rh negative
and they're not sensitized if no
antibodies we don't want them to be
sensitized so they would get rhogam so
we do need to know their blood type and
Rh type for that reason we don't really
need to know the ABO at that point
because we're not giving blood but we
really need to know their Rh type
because if there are negative they would
get rhogam most people don't know the
blood type I don't know that that's a
critical thing you know right this
minute but obviously you know it the
time of birth or if you're going through
some sort of procedure surgically the
hospital would say oh you need to be
typed just in case you know there's a
significant risk that you might receive
some blood you should be typed great I
want to just finish up I'd love to just
hear a little bit more about your
background and how you actually found
yourself it's sort of that the OB realm
of Medicine well I think like you in
high school biology was really
interested in reproductive medicine I
just thought it was very beautiful just
how you know the life is created and all
the different things that have to go
right in order to create a new person
and so from that intellectual interest I
carried that into medical school when I
did my OB rotation I found the people
who were in OB were very upbeat and
optimistic and energetic in general and
I think you know because most of our
outcomes are good it's it's not it's in
general a happy field because we get to
see beautiful babies
twins and triplets and some quadruplets
so the all kinds of things and yet
there's there's another component where
it's very intense
with you know fetal anomalies also
high-risk mothers that have had bad
histories where they've lost pregnancies
and they're hoping to get a good one
this time yeah so there's a whole
mixture of both happy and yet very
intensely possibly sad that we feel like
we can do you know make a difference
with and so that's that's what drew me
to OB and and that's why I like
high-risk OB because there's a chance to
be able to help people who not have such
great outcome in the past how do you see
genetics playing a role in the future of
you know pregnancy well geneticists
really the future you know I mean it's
occurring and the knowledge that's
happening in genetics is occurring is
such an incredible speeds
it helps us every single day I mean when
we when we see an ultrasound we wonder
if this is a genetic thing we wonder if
there's testing for it we wonder if we
can do it for maternal blood or whether
we need to do an invasive procedure to
find out what the answer is so all those
questions you know can change from like
week to week and so it's truly amazing
what genetics is is be able to offer us
one example I just want to give you is
this RH group system again so in the
past if the father had the D antigen and
could pass it to the fetus and we
weren't sure if if he just had it or not
we would have to do an invasive
procedure like an amniocentesis or
something called chorionic villus
sampling which is during the first
trimester and that would be able to type
the fetuses genotype for our RH group in
the future you know they're hoping to be
a dis on maternal blood and that's
that's a step forward in genetics
because eventually hopefully we could
avoid having to do invasive procedures
to get information and already we're
moving in that direction even with
testing for Down syndrome it's moved
into the maternal blood so we're doing
much fewer invasive procedures because
of that
so what's the basis behind that just
really quickly is that the fact that
there are blood cells from them yes
so there are blood they actually saw
blood cells now no now we're talk about
DNA so there's free-floating DNA from
the fetus from the fetus in the mother's
circulation they were for many years
looking for intact cells but it turns
out intact cells are problematic because
they can last for a long time they can
even be from the past pregnancy so
butBut free-flowing DNA is very
short-lived or relatively short-lived
yes it's from actually from apoptosis
which is word meaning cell death and so
these cells that die and they're
supposed to you know they turn over
release a DNA and and they're found in
maternal circulation and because of our
incredible incredible technology were
able to detect such minut amounts of DNA
and be able to separate that from the
maternal in a very complicated fashion
which I won't go into here but but by
using those techniques that are able to
determine like for example the fetal RH
type by just drawing blood on a mother
now it's not perfect yet I mean and I
think a test like this has to be perfect
because you don't want to miss diagnose
for example until the patient that your
fetus is d- and it's not at risk when
actually was deposited so you you can't
tolerate any mistake right you can't
have any error in this part has to be a
hundred percent accurate so when it
becomes like that then then we could
possibly possibly diagnose on maternal
blood with Down syndrome I think it's
already very close I mean something like
1 in 10,000 risk if you have a negative
test on the blood yeah
so they've able to reduce your risk to a
very very very low number based on that
so I think you know genetics is
fascinating that's another reason I went
to high risk OB because I really love
genetics I actually did a genetics
fellowship in addition to my hybrid OB
fellowship so it's a nice supplement
because a log that goes hand-in-hand and
everything you see now in OB and
ultrasound prenatal ultrasound is tied
into genetics um home very cool thank
you for what you do and for interviewing
with us oh my pleasure my pleasure
thanks a lot okay okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
