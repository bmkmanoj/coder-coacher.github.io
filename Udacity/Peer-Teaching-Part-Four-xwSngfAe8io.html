questions anymore no the teacher is
going to do is the teacher is going to
say here's where I think the level of
understanding is okay and then questions
will be generated accordingly well maybe
from a Gaussian maybe from a Gaussian
okay and in fact what I'm going to
suggest we do is that we're going to say
you need to pick a line now why should
you pick one line over the other because
i'm going to set up the incentive so
that you get +1 anytime the learner
answers correctly something they should
get wrong oh but you also get +1
whenever the student gets something
incorrect that they should get right so
what does that mean so if you say well
this is where their level of
understanding is what you're really
doing is you're kind of picking two
questions right you're saying look this
is a question that they should get right
and this is a question that should get
wrong but if you actually identified
where their level of understanding is
then sometimes they'll get some of these
things wrong that they should get right
these are easier and sometimes they'll
get right some of the things that they
should get wrong I sort of set up the
problem that way okay right and I'm
going to get credit for that so that
each area huh you the teacher I'm the
teacher going to get credit for that
well let's see what does that mean well
that means in order for that to work I
must have identified more or less
correctly where your level of
understanding is a learner cuz if you
set it too high the learners always
going to get things wrong but there are
things that the learner should get wrong
so there's no points to the teacher
mm-hmm and if you said the teacher sets
it too easy the bar down towards the
bottom then the learners never getting
anything wrong and when it gets things
right it's things that the learner
should get right and again should just
means below the bar set by the teacher
that's right so you'll get some points
by doing that but you won't get as many
as if you get it right where they ought
to be so the maximum comes when you've
done this 50-50 thing right where where
you're getting points for the learner
stretching a little bit getting a little
bit above and scoring well and you're
getting points for I guess tricking this
student in a sense like I would say
tricking which it really is your sort of
testing where their understanding really
is right so if it's the case that if
identify this correctly will still get
some things wrong that we would think
you would get writing it will get some
things right that we think you would get
wrong you really want to do it on both
sides and so if I move this line too far
to one side I only get i only get points
for one side of the bar if I move things
this far all the way over to the right I
only get points for the other side of
the bar I want to get things for both
sides of the bar hmm so that's only
going to happen if I can identify
roughly where your level of
understanding actually is that's clever
that is kind of clever did you come up
with this I came up with this by
listening to a guy named Jordan Pollack
when he told me this is what he ended up
doing with a real class of I think fifth
graders Oh interesting now by the way
there's something subtler we actually
aren't finished with this we just
described this as if it only happens
once really what we did is we spent a
lot of time talking about the teacher
and that makes sense because you know
the teacher has this complicated
incentive function right so the teacher
is going to get credit for basically
identifying where your level of
understanding it so let's say I've done
that I figure I know where your level of
understanding is I put the line here
okay what should you what it's going to
happen for you as a learner your goal is
still to maximize your points so how do
you maximize your points the learner
perspective just try to always answer
correctly right so how are you going to
understand suring things correctly
getting more and more things right by
learning by learning by actually moving
your actual bar to the right oh I see
because then you will not get these
things wrong anymore hmm and you will
get these things right and so you will
increase the number of points that you
get got it so then this will cause you
to learn more so that you can get more
things right and then what's going to
happen to the teacher teacher is going
to be unhappy but the teacher could move
the bar to the right right to kind of
catch up to where you actually are right
so the learner is incentivized to learn
and the teacher is incentivized to
understand really what the learner has
learned and they will keep pushing each
other until you've learned everything
ooh and then no one has any incentives
anymore yeah but at that point you know
everything and you're a teenager well I
was just was worried about this case
where so then the learner feigns
ignorance for a little while so the
teacher can move the bar down and then
starts getting things right and wrong
again yeah I don't know I guess that's
not really a concern yeah I don't think
so
and even if it is the teacher will
immediately figure this out and the
learner will be giving up points in the
meantime yeah it's not really the
maximal policy I mean you have to get it
exactly right right it's just that once
the learners learned everything the
teacher has no incentive anymore sure
but then once the learners learn
everything then you're not</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
