virtualization is related to you know
security and isolation things like that
this is your physical Hardware on top of
that we have this hypervisor it's also
called a virtual machine monitor or vmm
and on top of that we have this
different VM so this is VM 1 this is we
am - this is VM n let's say if you have
one of n of those if you somehow you
know compromised this operating system
it only affects the user applications we
have here it does nothing to the user
applications we have in other running in
other words to the machines this is what
we are saying is your trusted computing
base as long as you can trust this the
isolation across virtual machines is
going to work so compromised of this
operating system is not going to affect
these other virtual machines and the
applications running in those for us
virtualization is is important because
our focus is in security and you see
this isolation of these applications
earlier they all shared the same
operating system now they only share a
hypervisor why might that give you
better security we're going to talk
about that next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
