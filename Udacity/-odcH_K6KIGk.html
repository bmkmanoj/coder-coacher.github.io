Mad Libs generator but there are a
couple parts that could be improved
namely we wanted to be able to not only
replace noun and verb but any other
substitute that we wanted like adjective
person or name now just like the last
Mad Libs generator you wrote there are
many ways that you can build this and I
encourage you to try and implement your
own way but I'll show you the way that I
approach this problem which we'll use
for loops and lists let's say we have
this string Madlib 1 which is equal to I
can verb around place in this string
their words we want our place with user
input our verb and place however what if
we had this other sentence Madlib 2
which is equal to name is what they call
plural noun since we want a function to
be able to handle replacements like
place name plural noun and other words
we may add in the future why don't we
create a list of words which I'll call
parts of speech and set it equal to a
working list of possible or replacement
words like so since the words I know I
want to replace so far are verb
place-name and noun in this example I'll
set my parts of speech equal to a list
of those strings now that we have a list
of words you want to replace how do we
use it to create a Mad Libs generator
that replaces words with user input I
said that the string dot split function
would come in handy and this is where
we'll use it if we split the string
Madlib on the blank space well now have
each word in the list elements will also
create this empty list replaced which
you'll see how it will be used in just a
second now that we have our three list
setup parts of speech split Madlib and
replaced let's go over how we'll solve
this problem general idea is to iterate
through Madlib check if the current
iteration or word wrong contains a part
of speech and if it does will prompt the
user to enter the replacement word for
that part of speech and then add that
user inputted word to the list replaced
if the word isn't in parts of speech
we'll simply add the word we're looking
at to replace instead so let's run
through an example using the split
Madlib 1 so the first thing I look at is
this string I is this in parts of speech
no it's not
so I'll add it to replaced next I look
at can is this in parts of speech it
isn't so I'll add it to replaced now I
look at verb is this in part of speech
it is so I'll prompt the user to give me
a verb and let's say I put in jump I'll
now add that to replaced since a round
isn't in parts of speech I'll now add
that to replaced and now we're at place
now this is where things get a bit
interesting now notice that there is
this period at the end of place since we
want to keep all punctuation we're gonna
have to make our approach a little bit
more robust well first thing to check
that the string place is in the string
place with a period rather than just
comparing the two words for equality now
we'll need to replace just the word
place with the user input so we keep the
period and then add the replacement word
with the period to the list replaced so
let's say I put in Italy for place
replaced will now have Italy with the
period at the end of it as a last
element of the list and there we go now
we have a list with the replacement
words the only thing we need to do now
is change this list back into a string
we already know how to convert strings
to list by using the split function now
I'll show you just one more function
that's the reverse of that join as you
can see what will be joining on and the
string to join are in opposite positions
of the split function but no need to
worry if we join on replaced like this
our output will be a string that's equal
to I can jump around Italy now the real
beauty of this approach is that we can
add any words that we want to replace to
our parts of speech list and our
generator will work just the same now
that we've gone over the general
solution we want to implement it's time
to write some code</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
