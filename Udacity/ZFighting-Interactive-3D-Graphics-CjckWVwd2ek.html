sort of vaguely like the real thing if
you squint a lot modifying this model a
bit more
I made the legs white when I do this and
run the program this causes what is
called z-fighting
as you can see here what is happening is
that two polygons one from the foot and
one from the leg are overlapping
attempting to occupy exactly the same
location at one pixel one surface as the
depth will be infinitesimally closer
than the other due to precision limits
at the next pixel over the situation may
be reversed well this is fine
mathematically it can't happen in the
real world and clearly makes for
unconvincing images examine the problem
yourself by running the program find the
link in the additional materials the
question to you is which of these
solutions will fix the problem make each
leg a bit thinner so it doesn't overlap
with the foot use a newer GPU with the
higher precision Z buffer switch to
another rendering algorithm such as ray
tracing remove the bottom part of each
leg so that no part of the leg and foot
overlap I should note that I think two
of these answers are correct</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
