Internet's original design principles
these design principles were discussed
in the paper reading for today the
design philosophy of the DARPA internet
protocols by Dave Clark dated 1988 the
paper has many important lessons and we
will go through many of them as we
revisit many of the design decisions
before we jump into any details let's
talk about some of the high-level
lessons one of the most important
conceptual lessons is that the design
principles and priorities were designed
for a certain type of network and as the
internet evolves we are feeling some of
the growing pains of some of those
choices in the last lesson we talked
about a number of the problems and
growing pains with the Internet and it's
worth bearing in mind that many of the
problems that we are seeing now are a
result of some of the original design
choices now that's not to say that some
of these design choices are right or
wrong but rather that they simply
reflect the nature of our understanding
at the time as well as the environment
and constraints that the designers faced
for the particular network that existed
at that time now needless to say some of
the technical lessons from the original
design have turned out to be fairly
timeless one concept is packet switching
which we will discuss in this lesson and
another is the notion of fate sharing or
soft state which we will discuss in a
subsequent lesson in the course</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
