be able to solve the problem that we
started with at the beginning of this
unit which is the problem of extracting
a link from a page before we get to the
code I want to describe a little more
carefully what's going on in a webpage
so we've talked about strings in Python
and all the webpage really is is a long
string when you see a web page in your
browser it doesn't look like that so
here's an example web page one of my
favorite xkcd comics and hopefully
you're starting to learn enough about
Python to appreciate the power of Python
to make you fly probably the rest of the
comic if you haven't done anything other
than using Python is a little hard to
relate to now but it's making fun of
other languages where there's an awful
lot of work to do something simple like
we've seen here just being able to print
out a string but with Python we can fly
quickly and you're gonna learn to fly
very quickly in this class this doesn't
look like just a string we've seen just
a string as a sequence of characters
when we look at a webpage like this well
we see images we see buttons we see some
text we see things that are links and
you can see the underlines that these
are all links and the browser renders a
web page in a way that looks attractive
what actually was there though started
just as a stream of text if you
right-click on the web page one of the
options you see is view page source when
you click on that you'll see the actual
source code this is what came into the
browser so your browser send a request
the URL is what's shown in the address
bar so it sent a request to xkcd calm
slash 355 it sent that request and this
is what came back what came back is just
a stream of text we can look at that
text and some of it is fairly hard to
understand so what's important is the
links here's an example of the link so
the link starts with the a tag like this
the language HTML uses these angle
brackets and the angle bracket a href
equals is how we start a link that's
followed by a string which
is surrounded by double quotes similarly
to a string and Python so we have a
double quote between the double quotes
is a URL the URL is the way of locating
content on the web so here we have the
URL HTTP colon that means it's a web
request we'll talk more in a later class
about what HTTP means and the protocols
used to request web pages what's
important now is that's a location if we
open that in a web browser that will
give us another page what I'm looking at
here is the link that is underneath the
text for news slash blog if we click on
that link that will take us to the page
blaghhh that xkcd calm that was the page
that we saw in the link here it said
black dot xkcd calm when we clicked on
the link that's where we went so to
build our crawler what we want to do is
for each web page we want to find these
links in the page we're gonna keep track
of those links and we're going to follow
them to find more content on the web
this is similar to what someone would do
if their browsing if they're clicking on
every link of a page following all the
links they find looking at all that
content that's a really good way to
waste our horrendous amount of time if
you do that yourself we're going to
build a web crawler that can do that
automatically so our goal is to take the
text that came back from a web request
find it a link in that text which is
going to be a tag that starts with a
href equals and then extract from that
tag the URL of the web page that it
links to those are the URLs that we're
going to use in our crawler to make
progress so by using what we've learned
about strings and what you've learned
about variables you know enough to be
able to do that what we want to do is
find the beginning of a tag and what the
beginning of a tag is this text right
we're looking for something that matches
exactly the a href equals part that's
what the tags were here they all start
with a href equals not all web pages
have the same structure there are lots
of other ways to make it
the egg could be a capital letter for
example there could be more spaces
between the a.m. the href the double
quote doesn't actually need to be there
for what we do now we're gonna assume
that all our web pages follow the same
structure that we're seeing here that
each link starts with an a href without
any extra funny spaces or anything else
has an equal has a double quote has the
URL following that and then another
double quote so that means we're looking
for Strings like this we're looking to
find the a href that's followed by a
double quote after the double quote is
the URL this is what we actually care
about we want to find the URLs on the
web page that's followed by a closing
double quote and then there's more that
closes the tag and there's lots of other
stuff on both sides of this but this is
what we want to do we want to find the
tags that are links and then within the
tags that are links we want to find the
URLs so we're going to assume that we
start with the page contents in a
variable we'll call that page and we're
not going to worry today about how we
actually got those page contents we're
going to provide a function that does
that for the code that you have today
let's assume that page is already
initialized that it contains the content
of some webpage stored as a string and
our goal is to find the URL of the first
link in the page that's going to involve
a couple steps so what we want to do is
find the start of the link we want to
find where we have the a href equals we
can't just look for the first string we
find because there are lots of other
strings in the page that aren't URLs so
I think you know it enough to do that so
we'll make it a quiz so your goal for
this quiz is to write some Python code
that will initialize the variable start
link to be the value of the position
where the first a href equals so the
first tag that starts a link occurs in
page so you should assume that page
starts with the content of some webpage
and what we're doing is looking for the
place where the first a href equals
occurs and that's the first link on the
page</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
