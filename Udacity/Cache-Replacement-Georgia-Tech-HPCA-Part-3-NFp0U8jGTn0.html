when we are looking for it
let's talk about what happens when we
need to replace something from the cache
to make room for new data because we
have a Miss so the situation when we
need a replacement is the set where the
data needs to go is full we have a Miss
so we need somewhere to put the new
block that we are bringing in and we
need to put it in that set and the
question for cache replacement is which
of the blocks in the set do we kick out
to make room for the new one possible
replacement policies are random just
pick a block randomly from those that
are already in the set FIFO which kicks
out the block that has been there the
longest
so in FIFO let's say we have two blocks
we bring in a then we bring B when we
want to bring in C we're gonna kick out
a because it's been there the longest
then we're gonna kick out B to bring
deed and so on the next policy is LRU or
least recently used we want to kick out
the block that has not been used the
longest so we definitely don't wanna
kick out the block that is the most
recently used and then the next most
recently used and so on so pretty much
we track which block has been used more
recently and when we need to replace
something we choose the block that we
haven't used for the longest time it
turns out that LRU is a really good
policy so there are several policies
that are trying to approximate it
because this is not easy to do one such
policy for example is n mru or not most
recently used which tracks just which
block has been used the most recently
and then picks randomly among the
remaining blocks so pretty much don't
pick the block that was just used</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
