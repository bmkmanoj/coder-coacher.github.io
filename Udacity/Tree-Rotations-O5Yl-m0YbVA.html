is red and its sibling is black in both
you'll need to perform a rotation in a
rotation you shift a group of nodes
around in a way that changes the
structure of the tree but not the order
of the nodes keep in mind that this is
still a BST
so we need to keep our elements in
strict order in case for our red node
and it's red parent are not on the same
side of their parents our node is a
right child and its parent is a left
child here we will perform a left
rotation since the nodes shift one place
to the left while maintaining their
order at this point we have a setup that
looks exactly like case five where both
the red node and it's red parent are on
the same side of their parents here
that's the left we'll do a right
rotation here but this time involving
the grandparent and both of its children
we need to swap the colors of these two
nodes as well tada
we rearrange the nodes without changing
the number of black nodes in any path
those are all of the cases that could
arise an insertion again we just needed
to do some clever rearranging to keep
our red black tree and BST properties
satisfied in doing the rotations we kept
any one subtree from getting much larger
than the others insert like search and
delete is log of n in the average in
worst cases
bsts were oh of n in the worst case
because they could be unbalanced because
we're careful about staying balanced
here the run time won't be that large</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
