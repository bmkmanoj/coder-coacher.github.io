now let's state the fast Fourier
transform precisely for the general case
as input we have a sequence of numbers a
0 through a n minus 1 where n is a power
of 2 and we want to return the values of
the corresponding polynomial at the nth
roots of unity will state this as a
recursive algorithm and the base case is
where n is equal to 1 and in that case
we want to return the single element
sequence consisting just of a 0 the
constant term if n is greater than 1
then we call the fast Fourier transform
recursively once with the even
coefficients and once with the odds then
we combine the results taking care of
paired values together
notice the difference in the sign on the
contribution from the odd powers which
became s prime how long does this take
well we traded one problem of size n for
two problems of size n over 2 plus some
order n work for all the arithmetic in
this loop by the master theorem this
gives us a running time of order n log
in this is much better than the N
squared running time from the naive
evaluation by Horner's rule or by matrix
multiplication there's one of the
wrinkles that I want to add to the
algorithm and that is to say that this
Omega parameter here can really be any
primitive nth root of unity all that
matters is that all the powers be
distinct and that those be the roots of
unity so we can add this as a parameter
to our algorithm as well so we now take
in as well that Omega is a primitive nth
root of unity and we'll use that in our
update rules in here we'll see how this
comes in handy later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
