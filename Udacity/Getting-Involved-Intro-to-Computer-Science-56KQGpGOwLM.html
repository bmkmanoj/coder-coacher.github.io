Mozilla and director search here tell us
how you got involved in Mozilla in open
source projects I was actually a
graduate student at the time that I
first got involved I was interested in
JavaScript and I was doing research in
programming languages and I was spending
some time learning about JavaScript and
I wrote some webpages about it and out
of the blue Brendan Eich the CTO of
Mozilla and inventor of JavaScript found
the web pages that I had written and
sent me an email and said that he was
interested in talking to me about some
of the things that I had learned and was
doing and that experience alone was
incredibly eye-opening to me it showed
me that the assumptions that I had had
about the boundaries between research
and Industry the boundaries between
academia and Industry the boundaries
between just a person on the internet
and the movers and shakers in industry
were a lot more porous that I realized
and it showed that the web is this place
that brings people together who might
otherwise not have had any way of
getting to know each other so that was
very exciting and I started talking with
Brendan and talking with Mozilla and got
involved with the ECMO script Standards
Committee which is the standards
committee that that standardizes the
javascript programming language so I was
doing that while I was in grad school
and then when I finish grad school I
came to Mozilla full-time so a lot of
the students in our class have only been
programming for about seven weeks can
they still get involved in open source
projects or do they need a lot more
experience than that there's all sorts
of ways of getting involved in open
source projects you don't have to be a
computer science wizard to contribute
one of our largest sources of community
volunteer work is localization which is
basically translation so Firefox is
developed in English and our official
releases in English but we actually have
close to a hundred localized versions of
Firefox in countries all over the world
so we have volunteers in communities
that could be as large as
country is if it could be as small as a
small community in one country where
anybody can simply provide translations
of the menu items and the the windows
and dialogue boxes all of the stuff
where we have to present something to
the user we do it in English and then
you can translate it and now you can
have contributed to your native
languages version of Firefox another
project that we started is a project
called universal subtitles where you can
take YouTube videos that were recorded
in one language and you can provide
translation and the software will
automatically create subtitles based on
the translation that you provided so
there's all sorts of ways that people
contribute to Mozilla software to open
source software in general and it
doesn't always have to be technical it
can be code and sometimes we end up
hiring people who started out
contributing code and ended up working
on some of the most advanced parts of
our projects but it also can be as
simple as editing documentation or
providing translations so we have a real
wide range of different types of people
in our class can you tell us something
about it is it possible for for anyone
to get involved in open source software
one of the things that really appeals to
me about open source software is the
opportunity for a whole variety of
people with backgrounds and different
experiences and different interest to
get involved with the project a good
example of this is if you look back to
the Mozilla project in 2002 and 2003 we
were sort of struggling along with this
Netscape next generation netscape
communicator browser sweet and one day a
young 15 year old high school student
showed up in one of our IRC channels
where we all get together as engineers
and testers and the people working all
across the project and talk about their
work where we doing he came in and said
I don't like the way this particular
button behaves in Mozilla can someone
fix that and and I reach out to him and
I said you know that button is actually
powered by some simple JavaScript you
could look at the source code and maybe
you could fix it yourself and he said
well I put together
couple of web pages I know some simple
JavaScript and before you know it he was
a dedicated member of the team only a
few short months later he was one of the
founding members of the new firefox
project that would go on to reach 500
million users today this is a 15 year
old high school student with no
background in computer sciences he got
involved we had mentors who helped him
learn the pieces he didn't know he went
and read books and before you knew it he
was building one of the world's most
successful software products we also
have a number of students who come here
either for weekend work as you know
something to complement their education
we have people who are in the industry
and have been developing software for as
far back as the Fortran and COBOL days
who are looking for something that's
fresh and exciting and want to renew
their skill set and see participating in
open-source software is a way to work
with some of the younger people on some
of the newer technologies and to refresh
and get revitalized with their computer
software skill set and interests we have
people who are who are part time Mozilla
contributors working on it because
they're interested in a particular
feature set we have retirees and and and
people who are have part-time jobs
trying to fill the rest of their day and
who happen to know something about what
we're doing somewhere on the Mozilla
project sometimes that's writing client
software code in C++ but other times
that's Manning our volunteer support
desks the helping Firefox users fix
problems with with with their browsing
experience so open source really does
and many open-source projects really do
have multiple points where one can
attach themselves to the project and
find support and mentorship and some of
the places you attach yourself can be
very simple will often put some of our
most valuable programming resources on
very challenging projects and leave some
of the easier or simpler features or
smaller bug fixing on
onde as it were by a full-time staff
member with the idea that that staff
member can instead mentor a volunteer or
a student or a retiree to go finish off
that piece of the work and this is a
great learning experience at an
opportunity to develop a set of skills
that you can advance and grow and become
involved more deeply with the project
over time ultimately this young 15 year
old Blake Ross who helped launch the
Firefox project moved from fixing a
couple of style issues using some you
know JavaScript and CSS on toolbar
buttons to being the authority on a
bunch of the C++ code that made up
Firefox and that was probably in a short
time period maybe less than two years
that he was able to make that
progression almost exclusively through
open-source mentoring relationships on
the Mozilla project</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
