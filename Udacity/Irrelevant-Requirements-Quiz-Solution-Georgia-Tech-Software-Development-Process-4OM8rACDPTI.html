irrelevant requirements cannot lead to
missing functionality in the final
product because irrelevant requirements
actually refer to unneeded functionality
in the system so functionality that is
put in the requirements but it is not
really needed so we're not going to mark
this one indeed
irrelevant requirements can introduce
inconsistency so they could be a
relevant requirement that not only are
not pertinent but they are inconsistent
with some of the pertinent requirements
they can also waste project resources
because if we spend time designing and
then implementing the parts of the
system that refer to these irrelevant
requirements of course we're wasting
project resources and I will not mark
the last one because there's really no
correlation between any relevant
requirements and bugs in the software
system of course by implementing the
part of the system that refers to an
irrelevant requirement you might
introduce a part but that's not
necessarily the case and there's really
no correlation between the two</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
