do some amazing things so I'm sorry to
say but the train is back train show up
all the time and special relativity
don't ask me why but joining this train
our clocks held by two observers green
and red I don't know why but their
parents named them after the color of
their hair now what's going to happen
here is that green while standing on
this train and the train is moving with
some velocity V relative as a ground
well she's going to do a little
experiment she's going to take her
flashlight and bring it down to ground
level she's gonna send a beam of light
straight up so that it bounces off a
mirror and then comes straight back down
and she's going to time how long it
takes the beam of light to make this
round trip I should mention train has a
height will call h well now that we're
studying relativity we have to really
think about who's point of view were
solving the problem from and first let's
think about the training point of view
from the point of view of the Train this
is the right drawing to draw from greens
point of view it looks like well she
doesn't know the train is at rest so it
looks like the light goes straight up
then come straight back down so i'll do
a little arrow here showing that this
represents the green point of view from
the red point of view well as the train
speeds by it's not going to look like
the beam of light goes straight upwards
it's going to go over at some angle then
bounce back down and be collected and
observed one thing that's potentially
confusing here that I should point out
I've tried drawing both of these
perspectives on one train that's
difficult to do the red observer will
not see the light leave from this
portion of the train and then end up on
this portion of the train in front of
this front wheel because the train will
have moved forward as well okay great so
we've got our two frames of reference
the green frame and the red frame and
the light seems to take different
trajectories in each frame let's call
this total distance traveled up and down
in the green frame equal to D and the
total distance the light spends
traveling in the red frame d prime and
this prime is what we're going to use
often in special relativity to indicate
a different frame so we have our two
different frames everything that we're
talking about in the redhead frame will
put a prime on now my question is which
of these paths are longer actually what
I really want to know is which of these
statements are true is the distance
travelled in the green frame less than
equal
to or greater than the distance traveled
in the prime frame</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
