non-declarative memory because we cannot
directly recall this type of memory
implicit memory is a kind of memory
that's made up of knowledge based on
previous experiences such as skills that
we perform automatically once we've
mastered them implicit memory resides
outside of our conscious awareness so
for implicit memory we know how to do
something for example ride a bike but
it's difficult to describe how we can
perform the skills we know how to do so
well for example I know how to scuba
dive and I love to dive but it's
difficult for me to describe how you
swim through the water make sure waited
right have to inflate or deflate your
BCD it's something you have to
experience for yourself on the other
hand Susan knows how to knit and she can
knit really pretty scarves but if you
ask her how to explain it or give you
step-by-step instructions like I have
it's hard for her to do that
so for the example of Susan and knowing
how to knit she has to know where her
fingers belong where the needles go and
how to move the yarn around this is an
example of procedural memory so
procedural memory refers to the
knowledge we hold for almost any
behavior or physical skill we've learned
again this could be things like driving
a manual transmission car knitting scuba
diving playing hockey or any sport
priming is another type of implicit
memory priming occurs when recall is
improved by prior exposure to the same
or a similar stimuli in fact memory is
better for information that relates to
prior knowledge</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
