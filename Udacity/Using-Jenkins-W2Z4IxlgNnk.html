even without logging in we can look at
various projects that it's been set up
to build like adventure this project is
watching a github repo for another
Udacity course and every time a student
checks in an addition to that repo this
Jenkins instance recompiles it you can
see the history of it over here under
build history now if we go back to the
main page and log in then we'll be able
to access the server wide settings for
instance here are the security settings
that let us say what users are allowed
to do and over here is the list of
plugins Jenkins is kind of a plugin
based system everything you want to do
such as pull from github or run J unit
tests or various other things is there
on a plug-in now that we're logged in
let's take another look at that
adventure build target under the project
configuration you can see the name there
can be a description there's what
repository it's gotten from with a
github URL here and down here is the
build schedule it says how often the
build can be run if Jenkins notices
changes each over 15 in this field means
that it should be run every 15 minutes
and down here you can see the build
script that's actually being run turns
out this is just a mock-up and it runs
the disk usage or D you unix command if
this were a real build it would probably
run compilation and packaging here and
then if we look in an individual build
at the console output we can see the
output of that script having this kind
of log from every compilation is really
handy suppose that something had gone
wrong 10 builds ago would you rather be
diagnosing that from someone's email
saying something broker and I don't know
what or from a log file that says
exactly what's going on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
