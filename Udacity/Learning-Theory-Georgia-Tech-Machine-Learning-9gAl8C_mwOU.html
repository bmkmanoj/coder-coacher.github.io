placed in that it was about what this is
not about what this is about is
computational learning theory and
computational learning theory really
gets us a formal way of addressing three
really important questions one is what's
a learning problem let's let's define
very carefully what it is that we want
to learning algorithm to do if we can do
that we can actually show that specific
algorithms either work or don't work
with regard to the definition of the
problem and maybe we can even come up
with algorithms that solve those
problems better so that's kind of on the
upper bound side and then on the lower
bound side we can also show for example
in some cases that some problems are
just fundamentally hard so you define a
particular learning problem and you
discover wait the algorithms that I'm
thinking of don't seem to work you might
actually be able to show that no
algorithm say no algorithm is in some
particular class are ever going to be
able to solve them because that problem
is not solvable by problems in that
class so those problems are
fundamentally hard so answering these
kinds of questions require that you be
fairly careful about defining things and
using mathematical reasoning to to
determine what's going on so we're gonna
focus mostly on that talk about some
algorithms that are not necessarily
practical you wouldn't necessarily want
to use them but they do help illuminate
what the fundamental learning questions
are and and why certain algorithms are
effective and ineffective okay so
Michael can ask a question then sure
please so it sounds to me like you've
just justified this in the same way that
a computing theoretician might try to
justify theory are they related right
that's a very good observation in fact
the kinds of analyses and tools that are
used for analyzing learning questions
are also the same kinds of tools and
mechanisms that are used in the context
of analyzing algorithms in computing so
yeah that's exactly right
okay great in fact let's uh let's let's
leverage that analogy and we'll do it in
the context of a quiz</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
