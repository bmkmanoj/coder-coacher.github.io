process running on a processor let's say
your desktop your PC or laptop and so on
it's much larger than the physical
memory that is allocated for a
particular process so the role of the
virtual memory manager in the operating
system is to give the illusion to the
process that all of its virtual address
space is contained in physical memory
but in fact only a portion of the
virtual address space is really in the
physical memory that's called a working
set of that process and the virtual
memory manager supports the solution for
the process by paging in and out from
the disk the pages that are being
accessed by a process at any particular
point of time so that the process is
happy in terms of having its working set
contained in the physical memory now
when a node at desktop is connected on a
local area network to other peer nodes
that are also on the same local area
network it is conceivable that at any
point of time the memory pressure
meaning the amount of memory that is
required to keep all the processes
running on this node happy may be
different from the memory pressure on
other nodes or in other words this
particular node may have a much higher
memory pressure because the workload on
this node consumes a lot of the physical
memory whereas this workstation may be
idle and therefore all of this memory is
not being utilized at this point for
running anything useful because no
applications are running on these nodes
so this opens up a new line of thought
given that all these nodes are connected
on a local area network and some nodes
may be busy while other nodes may be
idle is it possible if a particular node
experiences memory pressure can we use
the idle cluster memory in particular
can we use the cluster memory that's
available for paging in and out the
working set of the processes understood
rather than going to the disk can be
paged in and out to the cluster memories
that are idle at this point of time it
turns out
with advances in local area networking
gear is already made possible for
Gigabit Ethernet connectivity to be
available for desktops and pretty soon
ten gigabit links are going to be common
in connecting desktops to the local area
network
this makes sending a page to a remote
memory of fetching a page from a remote
memory faster than sending it to a local
desk
typically the local disk access speeds
are in the order of 200 megabytes per
second in terms of transfer rate but on
top of that you have to add things like
seek latency and rotational latency for
accessing the data that you want from
the disk so all of these augers well for
saying that perhaps paging in and out
through the local area network to peer
memories that are idle may be a good
solution when we have memory pressure
being experienced at any particular node
in the cluster so the global memory
system or GMS for short uses cluster
memory for paging across the network so
in other words in normal memory
management
if virtual address to physical address
translation fails then the memory
manager knows that it can find this
virtual address on the disk meaning the
page that contains this virtual address
on the disk it pages in that particular
page from the disk now in GMS what we're
going to do is if there is a page fault
that is this translation virtual address
to physical address fails then that
means that the page is not in the
physical memory of this node in that
case GMS is going to say well it might
be there in the cluster memory in one of
the nodes of my peers or it could be on
the disk if it is not in the cluster
memory of my peers so that's the idea
that GMS is sort of integrating the
cluster memory into this memory
hierarchy normally when we think about
memory hierarchy in a computer system we
say there's a processor that the caches
and is the main memory and then there is
a virtual memory sitting on the disk but
now in GMS we're sort of extending that
by saying in addition to the normal
memory hierarchy that exists
in any computer system that has
processor caches in memory there is also
the cluster memory and only if it is not
in the cluster memory we have to think
of going to the disk an already get the
page that we're looking for that sort of
the idea so in other words GMS trades
network communication for this guy oh
and we are doing this only for reads for
reading across a network GM s does not
get in the way of writing to the disk
that is the disk always has copy of all
the pages the only pages that can be in
the cluster memories are pages that have
been paged out that are not dirty and if
there are dirty copies of pages there to
be written out to the disk just like
it'll happen in a regular computer
system in other words GM s does not add
any new causes for worrying about
failures because even if a node crashes
all that she loses clean copies of pages
belonging to a particular process that
may have been in the memory of this node
but those pages are on the disk as well
so this always has all the copies of the
pages it is just that the remote
memories of the cluster is serving as
yet another level in the memory
hierarchy so just to recap the top level
idea of GM s normally in a computer
system if a process page false that
means that the page it is looking for is
not in physical memory it will go to the
disk to get it but in GM s what we're
going to do is if a process page faults
we know that it is not in physical
memory but it could be in one of the
peer memories as well so GM s is a way
of locating the faulting page from one
of the pure memories if it is in fact
contained in one of the peer memories if
not it's going to be found on the desk
so that's the idea behind that so when
the virtual memory manager the virtual
memory manager that is part of GM s
decides to evict a page from physical
memory to make room for the current
working set of processes running on this
node then what the virtual memory
manager is going to do is instead of
swapping it out to the disk it is going
to go out on the network and find a pure
memory that's either
and put that page in the pure memory so
that later on if that page is needed it
can fetch it back from the peer memory
that's sort of the big picture of how
the global memory system works</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
