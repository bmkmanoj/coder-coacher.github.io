the third one is equal to positive one
and the last one is something else we
know these first two are equal to
negative one since each rational
expression contains opposite polynomials
the X terms are opposite in sign here
and the Y terms are also opposite in
sign so we know that this fraction can
simplify to negative one the same is
true for this fraction the B squared
terms are opposite in sign the vibe be
terms are opposite in sign and the
constant of one is also opposite in sign
I didn't show the factoring here but we
know that it will equal negative one if
we remove a factor of negative one from
the denominator and cancel our trinomial
in our third example the Y terms have
the same sign and the X terms have the
same sign so really this fraction is the
same expression and this third rational
expression the Y terms have the same
sign as do the X terms if we switch the
order of addition in the numerator will
have X minus y divided by the quantity X
minus y we know these expressions are
exactly the same so we really have 1
divided by one or just positive one for
this last expression we know it needs to
equal something else we can't just
square each term and call it a day we
know that this is really X plus 2 times
X plus 2 when we square a binomial we
get a perfect square trinomial looking
at this numerator and denominator we
know that our fraction doesn't equal
positive 1 or negative 1</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
