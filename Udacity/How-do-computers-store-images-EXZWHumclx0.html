that are cute images that are funny and
images that are awe-inspiring more
specifically I want to talk about how do
computers store images now we take a ton
of images from our phone and computers
every day I want to explore this idea of
how do computers store images so if you
get to the very end of this really long
video I promise there is something
magical in store we will reveal
something extremely magical about
computers ok let's begin here's what
we're trying to do if you take an image
of puppies how exactly does that image
get stored inside a computer we're
trying to build a bridge let's figure
out how that's done in trying to answer
this question I began to take some
inspiration from Hollywood so here is an
image that I found that I was in the
movie The Matrix and here's another
image that I found when I searched for
computer programmer or hacker which is
an image actually that is generally used
in the evening news when they're talking
about these subjects take a moment to
pause the video and try and figure out
if there are any similarities in between
these two images you may have noticed
that you see numbers like ones and
zeroes well it seems that Hollywood
wants us to believe that computers store
images as ones and zeros or data as ones
and zeros well in this instance they are
right the stereotype that computers
store things as ones and zeroes is
actually correct so this image that you
see of puppies inside the computer is
nothing but ones and zeros so how is it
that a beautiful image a beautiful
mosaic is just converted deep down into
nothing but two numbers let's find out
this conversation begins with the image
of a couple simple image the reason why
I chose this image is because it's
easier for me to explain to you with the
use of this particular simple image how
images are stored inside a computer I
could have taken another image but I
chose this one because it's easier for
me to explain it let's put a little grid
on this image so I can refer to the
different parts of the image really
easily alright so let's think about a
word that we've heard
turn around a whole bunch of times
called pixel what is a pixel well I
looked down in the dictionary and found
that it was made out of two words called
picture and element so a smallest
element in a picture is called a pixel
where's the X coming from I'm not quite
sure so each one of these little boxes
or squares that you see superimposed on
top of the cup
that's a pixel okay alright so this
image is particularly has what 12 pixels
as height and 16 pixels wide
so that makes it you guessed it 192
pixels can you see the top left pixel
the top the box at the top left where
the green arrow is pointing the computer
says this particular pixel is white so
I'm just going to store it as the letter
W all right then it moves on to the next
pixel and says that's white also so I'm
going to refer to is it refer to it as W
again and then the next pixel is black
so in this instance I'll refer to it as
B does this for the entire row the
computer does this and there it is we
have a whole bunch of letters that are
representing the picture once the first
row is done it moves on to the second
row and so on so forth so in our journey
to figure out how we go from an image of
a cup to ones and zeros we've stumbled
upon this idea that an image gets
converted into a sequence of letters all
right what's next
well the next thing is this organization
called Unicode short for universal code
and what it does is that it creates a
map between the letters A through Z and
actually many other characters and
number so it says a is 41 B is 42 so on
so forth W in this case is 57 and so it
basically is creating a map for between
letters and numbers and so using this
particular map what the computer does it
says all right if the first pixel was W
I'm going to try and remember it
as 57 okay the next pixel is W also so
it's another p57 the next pixel is B or
black and that is going to be remembered
as 42 so it does this for the entire row
again and for the entire image
and so we are now at a point where an
image of a cup was converted to letters
which have now been converted to numbers
that you and I can understand okay
well there is one more thing the
computer does after the step which is
that it takes these numbers that you and
I can understand the numbers like fifty
seven and puts it through a formula box
and the output from this formula box is
basically a conversion of that number to
ones and zeros so fifty-seven is
converted to the sequence of zeros and
ones that you see on your screen all
right so essentially what's going on is
that the number 57 where you see the
green arrow gets converted to a whole
bunch of zeros and ones and then the
next number gets converted and then the
next number gets converted and voila
what we have is essentially a whole
bunch of ones and zeros so to recap what
we have here is the image of a cup gets
converted into a whole bunch of letters
and then those letters in turn get
converted into numbers that you and I
can understand and then those numbers
get converted into a sequence of ones
and zeros now here's a question why are
we doing all of this why are we going
through the pains of converting an image
to ones and zeros well the answer is
hidden in this image I'll tell you the
name of this device in a little bit but
it's important for me to mention at this
point that when I first figured out what
this particular device does I fell in
love deep love for what we has a species
can accomplish and this particular
device I think is in the same vicinity
of inventions as the invention of the
wheel or us learning how to tame fire
it's called a transistor this is what it
looks like right here and it works very
similarly to a switch it might as well
have called it a switch but they call it
a transistor and set what it does is
that it can either be on or off
it can either have a value one or zero
all right let's connect it back to our
image so if our cup has been converted
to letters which have been converted
into numbers you and I can understand
which has been converted into ones and
zeros well each one of these ones and
zeros can be stored inside one of these
transistors now here's the really
interesting bit what we were able to do
is take this transistor that
you're looking at and make it smaller
and smaller and smaller to a point where
the smallest transistor that we have
right now is only four atoms wide and
what does that even mean
it means that we can fit 1500 of these
on top of a single strand of hair that's
really small and a lot of these
transistors exist inside our computer so
here's a simple image of a computer
which has a processor inside of it it's
about four square inches
guess how many such transistors we have
inside that space about four billion
folks we have four billion of something
inside our computer so if you take an
image like this an image of cute little
puppies
it takes about 400,000 transistors to
show that image to us when we look at it
in our phone or on our computer imagine
this when you ask your computer to show
you a picture of something hundreds of
thousands of transistors inside your
computer are working to make that magic
happen now if that doesn't blow your
mind nothing well so to recap I want to
say we started with a simple image of a
cup we were able to convert that image
into letters those letters were then
represented by numbers that you and I
can understand and then each one of
those numbers was converted into ones
and zeros and ones and zeros can be
stored by transistors and that's how
computers store images so we now know
that images on our computer are stored
as ones and zeros
I wonder if music is also stored as ones
and zeroes I wonder if movies are also
stored as ones of zeroes
I wonder if Gmail is stored as ones and
zeroes I wonder</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
