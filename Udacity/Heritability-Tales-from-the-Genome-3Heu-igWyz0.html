right right most complex traits are
actually result of multiple genetic
interactions with an environmental
influence going back to our nature and
nurture phrase how do we know how much
of a trait is from nature or from
nurture well it can be difficult to make
a blanket statement about how much is
nature and how much is nurture because
there can be a lot of variability from
individual to individual but what we can
do is look at all the differences in a
group of individuals and how much of
that is caused by a genetic influence
this is what we call heritability yeah
heritability we talk a lot about that in
psychology sure heritability is measured
on a scale from zero to one where 0
means that variation in the trade is not
due to genetics at all whereas a 1
indicates that the variation in the
trait can be explained completely by
genetics for example when people talk
about the heritability of a disease
they're referring to how much of
differences and risk for that disease
across the population is due to genetics
okay so it's not the same thing as
saying how much of a trait is genetic
exactly those are two different things
whether or not a trait is caused
genetically versus whether the
variability in a trade is due to
genetics let's go and take a look at our
example of height again suppose we're
measuring height in two different parts
of the United States now let's say in
the first population everyone has a very
similar economic status and that's a
very similar lifestyle but in the second
population people vary a lot and their
economic status and their resulting
lifestyles how would the heritability of
height compared between population one
and two do you think it would be the
same do you think it would be higher in
population one what do you think it
would be higher in population to
remember heritability is measured on a
scale from 0 to 1</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
