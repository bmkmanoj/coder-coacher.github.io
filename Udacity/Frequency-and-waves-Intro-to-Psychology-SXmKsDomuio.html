it had to do with how fast the waves are
shaking but the only difference I see
here is how spread out the waves are
that's a really great point line this is
what's hard about drawing ways waves are
moving all the time and when we draw
them we have to draw them still what
you're pointing out when you say the
wave is stretched out maybe from here to
here it's called the wavelength of the
wave but for now I think Susan actually
brought her slinky with her today so
maybe we can go to Susan Susan are you
there with your slinky bunny chance way
ahead of you Andy once you started
talking about waves I had a contestant
here to help out that's great Susan and
Susan do you think you can actually
shake your hand up and down really
slowly and make a nice low frequency
wave for us sure thing Andy here is a
large stretched out wave it is now what
happens if you shake your hand a little
faster here it gets much more compact so
high frequency waves are squished
together and low frequency waves are
spread apart that's right exactly so
high frequency waves have a short
wavelength whereas low frequency has a
long wavelength thanks a lot Susan it
looks like we're actually getting ready
for the next event yep will be ready
soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
