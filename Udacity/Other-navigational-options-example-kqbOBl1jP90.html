link called cricket so I'm going to
start and actually find this link again
I open the web roeder headings menu now
you notice I'm on the headings i'm going
to left arrow two links links menu and i
begin typing cricket nine items link
link cricket here it is I'm going to
press ENTER and the focus will go
straight to the cricket link link
cricket cricket now i'm going to
activate this link by pressing control
options space bar this is a voiceover
shortcut key press lank cricket cricket
with cricket wikipedia the free
encyclopedia page has 1079 links 52
headings for form controls 12 tables 14
landmarks so again you may have noticed
that voiceover just pronounced the page
summary it told me how many headings
links tables and for films on the page
there are which is a lot there's like
1000 links or something like that but
we're not interested in links anymore
what we're going to do next is look at
the form fields so I'm going to open web
broader again headings menu links menu
and arrow has menu until i reach form
controls form controls menu from here i
want to search form form filled with a
label of search because i'm going to be
searching for something 13 to 19
research insertion that beginning of
text sorry press Enter key to jump to
that field search insertion at beginning
of text search edit text search access
key available f you've noticed screen
reader told me the label of this field
but it also told me that there is a
access key or in other words it's a
shortcut key that i can press to quickly
jump to this search field from anywhere
on the web page if you're interested in
how access keys work please look into
instructors notes for more information
so what I'll do here I'll type the word
Udacity
udah city wikipedia the free
encyclopedia page has 346 links 16
headings for form controls two tables 13
landmarks notice how screen view to
pronounce the word Udacity as Judah city
this is a pretty common occurrence
because the speech synthesizer is trying
to take its best guess at how to
pronounce certain words and of course it
makes mistakes however screen reader
uses a pretty resilient to this sort of
to these kinds of situations because we
often tend to look at different webpages
and words aren't always spelled the way
we expect them to be to make the long
story short it's suffice to know that
screen readers to provide a lot of
shortcut keys and one of those shortcut
keys is a way to spell a specific word
or even a sentence letter by letter so
for example if I did want to know how
the word Udacity is spelled I could
simply jump to the place on the webpage
where the word occurs heading level
padding level 2 contents heading level 2
for items history heading level 2 form
control one item headings menu one item
heading level one udah said heading
level one who does it and then I can
press control option W to have voice or
spell this word out for me udah City
uniform Delta Buddha city you da CIT why
the alternative spelling is just going
to teach me to spell things wrong so
please refrain from using these methods
in the name of improving the experience
of screen reader users</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
