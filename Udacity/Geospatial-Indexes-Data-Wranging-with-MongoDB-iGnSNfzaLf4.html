another type of index geospatial indexes
in particular support for geospatial
indexes in MongoDB give us the ability
to perform queries for locations near
another location so the type of thing
that a lot of phone apps will do when
you're say looking for a nearby cafe now
the type of geospatial index that were
going to talk about is 2d geospatial
indexes I'm going to be also provides
support for spherical geospatial indexes
that is those that take into account the
curvature of the earth but I'll direct
you to the documentation and our courses
at MongoDB University if you're
interested in learning more about those
so with 2d geospatial indexes we're
essentially thinking of our data as all
lying on a Cartesian plane with values
in the x direction and the y direction
so in these situations we have a query
location of some kind and what we want
to find in response to queries are other
items or documents that are close to
this query location so there's
essentially three things you need to
know about in order to construct a
geospatial index in MongoDB the first of
those is that you need a field that
holds a location and the location needs
to be stored as an array with first an x
value and then a y value now you can
name this field whatever you want I've
just chosen the name location here it
could be loke or position point anything
you like but it does need to follow this
form of having the x value first and
then the y the second thing you need to
know about is that you need to ensure
there's an index in you to call ensure
index and create an index on this
particular field so in this case I would
need to call ensure index specifying
location as the field and I would need
to specify a direction here we'll take a
look at a specific example of that in
just a bit so again we need to create an
index now on this field that we have for
our documents that we want to use in
geospatial queries and finally the way
we do queries against the geospatial
index is through the use of the dollar
near operator so it's these three steps
in combination that allow us to do
something like this and get all of the
documents that have a location near this
one so let's take a look at this in some
code and then we'll do an example query
in the Mongo shell
so this is a script that I actually
retrieved from the OpenStreetMap folks
this is a script that they wrote for
putting osm data into MongoDB so you can
see here that it's going to do iterative
parsing of our osm data just like we did
in a previous example back in lesson 3
now let's take a look a little bit
further down first because I want to
show you the location field here so for
every node in this file this script
builds a value called lok and it is
composed of the latitude value and the
longitude value for a node element in
the xml file then it adds that field to
the record that it's building up as it
moves through the node that it's
creating a document for ok and then
finally it will end up creating a
document in MongoDB by doing an insert
at some point ok now using that location
field at the very top of this code
ensure index is called and ensure index
is called using that location field
which stores the XY coordinates for
nodes that are parsed out of the OSM XML
file now the syntax for ensure index is
slightly different in PI Mongo it
matches the syntax for the language here
which of course is Python ok but then
also rather than passing a dictionary
what we pass instead is a list of tuples
so we pass the name of the field that we
want to create an index on as well as a
direction so these are constant values
that are available to us in PI Mongo so
we're not simply typing strings here
which is potentially very error-prone
ok and you can see that ensure index is
actually being used here to create
several indexes here's another example
where we're creating an index on ID and
we're specifying that we want that index
to be created in ascending order
ok so technically speaking geo 2d is a
direction argument for ensure index and
the reason why it makes sense to think
about this as a direction argument is
because queries using the near operator
will always return documents sorted by
those that are nearest to the query
location ok so now let's take a look at
an actual query and bear in mind that
the query that we're gonna look at in
the Mongo shell is a query against the
collection that we created using this
script this is exactly
the script that I used to create this
collection and store documents in it
within MongoDB okay so let's take a look
at a query here now what I need to do is
make sure that I'm using the OSM
database and then I'm going to query the
nodes collection that script we just
looked at actually creates several
collections one of which is nodes and
these are based on the nodes tags that
appear in the OSM data set now again
we're using the chicago osm dataset just
for a point of clarification okay so
what I'm going to do here then is query
this particular collection and note that
I'm querying against the location field
and I'm using the near operator okay and
I'm specifying a set of coordinates here
okay so this is the type of thing that
an application might do in order to find
restaurants or other amenities near the
location of a user making the query okay
this is how we might do this sort of
thing in the backend of an application
that supports that type of functionality
now I'm doing one other thing here and
this is really just for purposes of this
example and you remember from a little
earlier in the lesson when we looked at
the tags that get applied to nodes that
there's this TG field in this collection
okay and just so that the data we get
back is a little bit more interesting
I'm just ensuring that there is a TG
field that it actually exists because
then we'll have some data that has some
names and other sort of tagging
associated with it so we can kind of
figure out what's there near this
particular location now this location
happens to be quite close to Wrigley
Field so what we're going to get are a
number of restaurants cafes convenience
stores that sort of thing in that
neighborhood so imagine you've just
walked out of Wrigley Field and you're
looking to see what's nearby on your
phone this is the type of query we might
do in the backend of an application to
support that sort of thing okay so
here's our initial set of results we
could get more by typing IT here in the
shell all right we can see there's a
Jamba Juice there's a school church a
convenience store in this case happens
to be a Walgreens Domino's Pizza and a
Dunkin Donuts okay so that's pretty much
what you need to know in order to be
geospatial indexes in MongoDB we'll take
a look at using geospatial indexes in
the case study in the next lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
