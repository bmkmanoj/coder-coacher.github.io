domains such as google com and Udacity
com do share something the comm
top-level domain there's actually a
collection of servers who are
responsible for stirring all of the
records for domains in comm and in org
and edu and each other top-level domain
including country code domains like UK
and IL and ua at ww.com is a sub domain
of example calm and test w example calm
is a sub domain of that there's no rule
that you can't have hosts at any level
of these subdomains you can have a host
with an IP address and an a record on
one domain and then have a subdomain of
that with a different host on it now
early in the history of the web it was
common for an institution whose domain
was let's say stanford.edu to have its
web server at ww stanford edu and that
would have typically been a single
machine that was the web server
representing the institution but these
days since so many domains are used
almost entirely for web traffic many
organizations skip the www and just
point their domain directly to a web
server like github com for instance the
name www com is a cname an alias for the
a record github com whether to use bear
domains like github does or wwas like
Udacity does is pretty much a style and
branding preference there's little
technical difference for computers
within an organization it's pretty
common for them to also have a
configured search domain this tells the
resolver on that computer to look up
hosts inside that domain first like if
you're on the network of the University
example that edu you might have that in
your search term and then when you look
up the DNS name ww the resolver will
look for ww example to edu first</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
