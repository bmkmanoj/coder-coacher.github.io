the service we were going to charge that
there is going to be paid plans on their
service we saw no reason why we should
start off with a free plan we were like
this was going to be a business that
makes money and in 2006 that was not
vogue at the time quite honestly a lot
of people were like build a free get a
bunch of users and figure out how to
monetize later and we were just like I
don't know it seems like we can monetize
right now why don't we go ahead and
start that and then we don't have to
worry about the weirdness of forget like
it's easier to give more stuff for free
than it is to start charging stuff for
later on is the way we thought about it
and so when we did YC we had not been
any lines of code and we started in the
January of 2006 and that's when we first
started writing and programming with
Phil and then we had an interface
prototype in February so in about a
month and that interface prototype
allowed you to see how a new way of
building forms and designing them but it
didn't hook up to a database you
couldn't save it you can collect
information but allowed people to see
like this is a better way of doing
things better than what you would see
from say Microsoft infopath or other
form builders out there and we said like
we should ship this right like see what
people say basically do that step of
talking users getting engagement and get
people excited about it and so we
released an interface preview demo and
that demo at the end of it you create
design the form and when you hit the
save it says thanks for trying out to
demo when you want to know when we
finally launched give us your email
address and we got over a hundred
thousand people to go through that demo
so that when we've long to be able to
start off upfront off of it but the
thing is part of that idea also again
came from Joe Kraus surprisingly at the
time where he talks about like a lot of
companies what they don't realize is
that they should not just beta test
their product but beta test their
pricing right they're paid upgrade and
conversion triggers and you're never
going to know that until you finally put
a price up there and put a button that
says you can't do this until you pay and
so like a lot of that just resonated
with us we're like this company needs to
be something that stands on its own and
I guess you could say we were the kind
of founders that didn't have the risk
profile to say like we're going to take
the risk on like giving tons of things
are free try to figure how to scale and
eventually monetize to us it was like
this is either gonna be something people
pay for other words
and I think for ninety-nine percent of
b2b sort of companies and services it's
easy sort of do I think I meet a lot of
founders who think I'm building
something it's better than the
competition it's easy to use it's faster
and then I'm going to charge a whole lot
less for it and I think that's usually a
mistake people have armed just going to
give it all the way for free it's like
that's where losing out on a lot of
opportunity and economics for stuff</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
