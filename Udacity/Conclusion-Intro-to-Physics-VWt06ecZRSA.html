incredible what you can do now using
just a little bit of geometry and some
trigonometry you can calculate the
circumference of the earth based only on
the length of shadows that's really
amazing before you move on now's a great
time to take a break go outside look at
some shadows enjoy life not that physics
isn't enjoying life of course when
you're done with that if you're still
interested you can do the optional unit
on error calculation a very important
part of physics and a lot of interesting
error to think about in this experiment
after that you should go outside and do
the experiment yourself that's going to
be the first part of the homework is
collecting data as a class and measuring
the circumference of the earth you
already have all the knowledge you need
to do the homework except I do have one
recommendation to make your life easier
I would definitely watch the video
titled better trigonometry in the error
calculation unit the reason for this is
you don't want to spend your whole life
calculating trig functions by looking at
tables there's a better way to do it and
in this lesson you learn how that's it
for now and again congratulations and
good luck on the homework</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
