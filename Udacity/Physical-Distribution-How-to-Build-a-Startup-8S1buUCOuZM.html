distribution channel let's take a look
at all the choices that you might have
when you start your company the first
one is you might be in om om stands for
original equipment manufacturer you
might have a component let's say a
graphics chip that goes inside of
someone else's laptop so you might be a
graphic supplier to Apple or or you a
Packard but its apple and HP's name and
their brand that shows up on the outside
of the box and so while you're making
money it is their marketing and brand so
for system integrator
you might be selling to a company let's
say you're Cisco but you're selling to
somebody who's building an entire
telephone switching Network and this
system integrator would take your
component your switches and routers and
actually build out a system that
includes devices from other companies
and they add some value-added software
and additional hardware and create an
entire system for an end-user
a value-added reseller might take a
computer system and other prepackaged
software's from other third-party
vendors add maybe some utilities of
their own and sell a turnkey solution to
an end-user and so they build less
complex systems with a less value-added
than system integrators but they could
be great partners in a physical channel
a direct sales force our sales people
that work for you directly and typically
sell directly to the end-user now if
you're delivering a physical product one
of the alternate channels then you might
want to consider is the web or online
sales as well so for some industries
distributors play a pivotal role in the
distribution of the product they provide
wholesale warehousing they provide
distribution and accounting bill
collection etc and distributors might
sell to dealers most dealers are just
simply store fronts some of them might
actually add some services support but
they're essentially an extension of the
distribution channel and they talk to
the end-users so dealers might not have
a
physical storefront for end-user
customers but retailers are all about
Main Street and talking to your
customers
another form of retailer or mass
merchants so instead of just small
storefronts they aggregate tens or
hundreds of thousands of products under
one roof retailers and mass merchants
often though not always get their
products of supplied through
distributors</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
