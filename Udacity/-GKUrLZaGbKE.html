introduce to other list operations the
next one is + + behaves very similar to
the concatenation operation for Strings
if we have the list 0 1 + the list 2 3
the result is the list 0 1 2 3
so what + does like concatenation for
Strings is it produces the new list it
doesn't mutate either the input lists so
I want to introduce one other operator
that works on lists and that's the Len
operator Len is short for length and we
use Len like this it looks like a
procedure call we pass into Len the
object that we want to know the length
of that can be a list Len actually works
for many things other than lists it also
works for Strings it works for any
object that's a collection of things and
the output from Len is the number of
elements in the input so for example the
result of Len applied to the list 0 1 is
2
since there are 2 elements in the list
the result of applying when to this list
is also 2 it looks like there are many
more elements here but Len is only
counting the outer elements so if one of
the elements of a list is a list it
doesn't matter how many elements that
list contains it only contributes one to
the length of the original list so the
result of this call would also be 2 we
can also use Len on a string and the
output will be the number of characters
in the string in this case the string
Udacity has seven characters so the
output is seven so now we're ready for
some quizzes to see how well you
understand the three list operations
we've introduced the append operation
which is invoked on a list and takes an
element as a parameter and adds that
element to the end of the list the plus
operator which operates on two lists as
its operands and produces a new list
that consists of all the elements in the
two lists put together and finally the
Len operator that takes a list as its
input and produces an output a number
that is the length of the list the
number of elements in the input list</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
