I'd like to illustrate the opportunities
that it delivers with an example based
on animo Tom this is an example service
and this was a post for child of cloud
computing in its early years around
2008-2009 this example that I'll
describe next is repeatedly referenced
in in cloud computing talks again
especially in those early introductory
years in the mid-2000s Amazon was
already a dominant online retailer
servicing large volumes of online failed
transactions vast majority of these
transactions were taking place during
the u.s. holiday shopping season between
Thanksgiving and Christmas and to deal
with this peak load Amazon provisioned
the hardware resources so made sure that
they've acquired sufficient number of
servers for this particular load what
that means is that the rest of the year
a lot of those resources were idle or
they were serviced for other company
tasks for instance forecasting or other
analytics but regardless there was still
a lot of idle cycles now since Amazon
had already developed some software
infrastructure to allow these machines
to be reprovision and used by other
services within the company with the
ended up doing in 2006 they opened up
toast exact same type of API to the rest
of the world with this vid it allowed
third-party workloads so not just Amazon
workloads but completely random
customers to run their workloads on
Amazon's Hardware obviously for a fee
this was the birth of Amazon's Web
Services or AWS and Amazon's elastic
compute cloth or ec2 one of the
companies that appeared around the same
time as Amazon's ec2 cloud was Animoto
some of you may have used this service
it turns an album of pictures into a
video and although this sounds simple
it's a fairly compute intensive job that
involves a lot of image processing steps
so that the video appears as smooth as
possible so they decided to focus their
resources on the development of the
mechanisms that make better videos and
instead of
and running their own equipment they
chose to rent some of the web provided
compute infrastructure that was part of
Amazon's compute clock the company was
doing ok and it had a relatively steady
workload which required about 50 of
these Amazon's compute instances now
these are not physical servers instead
they were virtual machines they have no
control over exactly how Amazon runs
these virtual machines whether they're
in the same physical server and many
other physical servers then in April
2008 Animoto became available on the
Facebook platform what it means is that
it became an option available to
Facebook users with a click of a button
to turn their timeline photos or albums
into a cool video what happened
afterwards with the definition of going
viral within 3 days Animoto signed up
750,000 new users and from the 50
compute instances of the 50 machines
that it needed on Monday that number
became 400 by Tuesday so an order of
magnitude larger in a day and then by
the end of that week by Friday that
number of machines was 3,400 two orders
of magnitude increase in the resources
just within a bad week just within those
five four or five days there's no way
they could have been able to respond to
this dramatic increase in demand if they
had gone with a traditional route of
owning and managing their own
infrastructure you just would not be
able to bring in install wire configure
at cetera as many machines in such a
short time even if by some miracle they
actually did have the physical space and
could fit all of these machines in the
machine room and then that there was
sufficient power to power all of them
the only reason that Animoto was able to
do this is because they used a
cloud-based deployment and then they
leverage the capabilities that cloud
computing offers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
