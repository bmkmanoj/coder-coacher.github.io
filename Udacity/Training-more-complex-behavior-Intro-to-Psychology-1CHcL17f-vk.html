and the water command comes off of the
the target command by just moving the
target into the water good I can also
ask Callie to go target at a distance
from me that's something I call a remote
target and it works just like my hand
target does Callie target hold where
Callie will touch her nose to that spot
and part of the shaping of that behavior
good is that we extend the target
behavior out for longer and longer
durations of time as Callie has had a
chance to master the behavior but now we
can add to create more complicated
behaviors we can add more target points
onto the animal's body so this is a
flipper target and I can use this
flipper target to examine Callie's
flippers and her under surface to make
sure that there's no cuts or abrasions
or anything developing that we wouldn't
want to see good we can create a target
on any place of the animal's body that
we want good and we have created even
more complicated targets Callie has a
head target head good that I've used to
create other behaviors such as this one
for example which is called flexible but
so this is the head target that I used
and I moved closer and closer back good
to create this behavior which is now on
cue okay this is a new behavior for cali
she's just learning this behavior and
because of that the target boat prop is
still in there some of these other
behaviors no longer has the target that
used to create the behavior so just like
my hand target the target pole the end
of the target pole is where Callie is
going to put her nose wherever I put my
target Callie will put her nose then
with some practice and practicing the
antecedent of the
q or the command prior to the behavioral
sequence that I'm forming through
operant conditioning I can eventually
take the target pull out and she will do
the behavior just on command because of
the rehearsal history in this case the
behavior is not ready for the target
pole to be removed yet this is the
backflip behavior for which my program
is famous that is our logo and this
behavior is initially formed in the
lower portions of the water where the
animal has full control and they learn
to first do the backflip here then i use
the target pole to lift the backflip up
and hold it in position out of the air
like so after being preceded by the
antecedent q flip good rep WEP and
that's how you get a backflip good job
way to go you yeah good job good the
benefits of animal training and
husbandry demonstrated live and in
person by cali the scene I</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
