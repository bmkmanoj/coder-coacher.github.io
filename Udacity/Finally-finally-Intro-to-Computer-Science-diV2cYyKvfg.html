provides an extra construct that can be
used as part of the try statement it's
called the finally clause and the way it
works is the code in the finally block
is guaranteed to always run regardless
of whether the try block finishes or we
go through an exception handler so it
could work like this we could run the
try block if we complete normally it'll
go to the finally block run the finally
block and then we're done and note that
even if there's something that changes
control flow in here suppose there's a
return and we're inside a function
definition if that's in the middle of
the block here normally you would think
well when we return we return no other
code runs if we got it finally that's
not the case the finally code will run
before the return happens if there's an
exception before we get to that let's
say there's an exception in the try and
it goes to the exception handler well
that will run we're still guaranteed to
run the finally code so this is a
construct that leads to lots of complex
control flow execution jump unexpectedly
well unexpectedly if you don't know what
to expect hopefully you know what to
expect because you've been paying
attention but execution can jump around
and all sorts of strange ways but it
guarantees that this finally code which
cleans up if something failed always
runs so this almost works so we've added
our finally clause and inside the
finally clause we're closing the file
and because of the semantics of the
finally whether we succeed in writing or
we go to the exception will eventually
run this close and we only need it in
one place so this almost works but not
quite let me show you what happens so
I'm going to try running it and I'm
running it in a directory where the
blimpie file is not writable and here's
what happens i get the error so I'm
catching the exception printing error
writing file permission is denied but
now when i try to do f out close as you
can see here i get a namer and i get an
error because since the open didn't
succeed f out was never defined and we
get a name error because the name f out
is not defined</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
