this class I just want to tell you what
you've learned because it did amazingly
well you learn about localization you
vote an algorithm and implements what's
called Markov localization you learned
about probabilities based rule and total
probability you implemented all of this
and you solved interesting quiz
questions this is an enormous amount of
work you're now able to make a robot
localize but you also have a very
intuitive understanding of some very
interesting and important probabilistic
methods that are commonly called filters
so next class we're gonna see new
filters in particularly we're going to
talk about particle filters and common
filters and we will apply both of those
two really interesting problems in the
Google self-driving car in particular to
the problem of finding and predicting
other cars I will see you in the next
