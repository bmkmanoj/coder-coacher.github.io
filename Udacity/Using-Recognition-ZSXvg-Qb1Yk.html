problem well
recognition it's a fundamental part of
perception whether talking about robots
autonomous agents whatever the idea is
that the ability to know what things are
and therefore how you want to interact
with them is really important it it
gives you a way of organizing and
thinking about the visual content of the
world and perhaps even more importantly
it's a very human way of thinking about
things right I give the objects labels
and if I tell you to go pick up the cup
and put it away you know what I'm
talking about
so we want our scenes and the systems to
be able to do that too so for example
autonomous agents and here's a pair the
one on the left is a robot this is from
Kyle's route to me mass four and
Ruettiger Dylan's work on domestic robot
and this robot has to be able to go pick
up cups out of dishwashers it has to
know that there is a dishwasher it has
to see that oh I put that cup down it
didn't make it and go get it it has to
be able to be told that the cups go over
there
all right so if I'm gonna communicate
about these things to that robot I'm
gonna use labels that talk about these
objects even an autonomous system so
here I think this was Stanley I think
that was one of the urban grand
challenge vehicles one of the winners it
has to understand that this is a thing
and this thing we know that it's called
a car all it needs to know is it's this
thing that it's learned a lot of things
about and that this kind of thing which
our cars do things like continue moving
might stop have certain behaviors
likewise that this object there might
move in your way and it uses a lot of
machine learning to do that maybe not
quite the traditional labeling the way
but the idea is that these autonomous
agents understand the nature of the
world being carved up in objects and I
can communicate about them and it can
autonomously detect them labeling people
that's a recognition task this is
something we do all the time you know
every time you tag folks on Facebook and
it both finds that it is a face will
talk about detection a little bit but it
also you might want to know who it is
Peter Bellmer and folks did these
digital field guides where you'd like to
be able to like maybe take a picture of
a leaf and say you know what kind of
leaf is that if you're into that nature
kind of thing which I'm not but it's
this idea of being able to recognize
things and maybe
you found some really expensive stuff
online and you say please find me more
shoes that look like this for any
relatives of mine that I'm still
continuing to subsidize so you can use
computer vision to help you find less
expensive shoes just saying all right
the idea of you know can I find
something that looks kind of like that
so I have to recognize that it's a shoe
maybe sorry label the shoe recognize the
type that kind of thing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
