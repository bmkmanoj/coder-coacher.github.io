a lot of api's you'll have to talk to
some of them might be JavaScript API is
that don't involve much more than
calling a function in JavaScript other
api's are provided by 3rd parties and
require you to make HTTP requests
yourself a restful api is one that
follows a design called rest that works
especially well with HTTP rest stands
for representational state transfer but
let's be honest that is not really a
very descriptive name not all API is
follow the rest pattern but many do so
let's take a look at the underlying
concept the basic entities are
collections and objects inside those
collections the general pattern to
retrieve items from collections is using
a get request with both the collection
name and the unique I to name in that
collection for example if I want to look
up Richard I'd send this request and the
server would get the record containing
the data about Richard if I wanted to
update the data in that record I'd use a
put request and append the updated
information to the request every
subsequent get request should now yield
the update record the post request is
used very similarly to put but instead
of updating existing records you use it
to create new records notice that
usually do not provide the name under
which the new record will be created but
let the server make the choice for you
the response to the post requests is
usually a redirect to the newly created
record and lastly delete is just what
you think it is it removes items from
the collection</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
