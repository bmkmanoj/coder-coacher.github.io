picked out the first pair and that
should be if there are two pairs that
should be the highest because remember
the ranks are ordered from highest to
lowest so if I'm going through the ranks
from left to right I should hit the
highest one first and then to find if
there's a low pair what I've done is
reverse the ranks and then look through
those so now I'm going from lowest to
highest and I should find the lowest
pair first so now if I found a pair and
i found a low pair which is not equal to
the pair then i want to return the two
of them otherwise i just returned done
so congratulations we've gone through
the whole program we've come up with a
solution and now if when we hit the Run
button it prints out tests pass so we've
done everything that we promised to do
and it works okay but I'm still not
confident because I know we've done some
tests but we haven't done exhaustive
tests yet so I feel pretty good about it
you should feel good about what we've
done together congratulations on that
but don't feel like we're done yet the
we still got to come up with more tests
to prove that we've got it right in
every case and in fact I want to share
with you a test that somebody pointed
out to me that I hadn't thought of it at
all</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
