can do your do this project the better
off it is I suggest just in line the
whole CSS file honestly like if you're
having trouble like trying to figure out
which CSS is critical which CSS is not
critical that's it's the data it's like
for us to know what Google is actually
looking for we either need to use some
sort of package like a grunt package or
a bower package that people have program
and they they under the research already
to figure out which elements of this
HTML or critical for rendering
above-the-fold content instead of you
just having to actually just a guess and
pick what type what type of elements and
calls are critical so I I really just
recommend in line your entire CSS minify
it and you should be fine to have help
you deal with the render blocking
content and again using javascript to
low CSS make sure that you're following
the right instructions there if if you
have like more questions about how to
implement the JavaScript to load the CSS
post that post your coat on Piazza so
all of us can actually look at the code
and see how you're doing that inject
JavaScript there could be in some sort
of implementation issue that you may be
having to that prevents you from
successfully loading the JavaScript
after everything's being loaded again
another another tip is to actually put
the CSS at the bottom of the page rather
than at the top because then that will
actually help you go ahead and uh that
will get rid of the render blocking
content because remember in your class
you know the browser downloads the HTML
code it then goes and uh gets it does a
get request to actually get the CSS and
the javascript file in your header tag
so and then it waits for all the CSS and
the javascript to load and do their
magic why don't you just put everything
at the bottom of the
HTML page that actually will help with
render blocking as well in lining is
basically you're actually now we're in
the mindset of okay how can i create
production code we're not in development
code anymore like in project one project
too because we're we force you to follow
very strict style make sure the code is
very neat nice and organized but this
time often in the real world put
developers will have development code
which is nice and pretty and then
production code which is very very other
so basically inlining gets rid of all
the extra spaces a blank spaces mm-hmm
newline characters anything that doesn't
pertain to the actual code itself so so
basically I have this whole page of code
I inline it and I minify it I actually
minify I actually get rid of all the
spaces and extra characters into one
single long line and you can't you
cannot read it and then you're in line
you're actually putting the CSS in that
code inside the HTML our site because
again we want our goes to create
production code so mobile devices
devices that have that doesn't have a
that hiva internet speed could
effectively download your site as fast
as possible and then they could use your
site as fast as possible we're going for
like one second load loading time that's
the ideal or else if if it takes two to
three seconds to though you're you can
start getting impatient yeah and you
would not want to do that for our users
absolutely and essentially by removing
those extra spaces and new line
characters we are reducing the size of
the file yeah so you're doing the
critical sizes of your father so that's
actually as critical as well so we don't
want anything that's not useful you know
we don't want browser to download
anything that's not useful exactly oh
that's not a little bit yeah just
whatever we need a minimum amount of
downloading yeah that improves the speed
a lot yeah don't raise the speed of your</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
