what is the scan operation so there's
three inputs to scan the first is an
array of length n the second is an
operator a binary associative operator
for the purposes of explaining this
we're going to assume that that operator
is plus and finally we have an identity
element that's associated with this
particular operator so in this case the
identity element is 0 let's keep in mind
that this discussion will apply to any
binary associative operator so our input
is an array of length n we start off by
designating the first element of the
input is a 0 the second element is a 1
the third is a 2 and so on and so the
scan operation will produce an output
given these inputs so what does that
output actually look like so the output
at any given position is the sum of all
the elements that precede it in the
input so let's see that actually works
so the output at position 0 is the sum
of all the elements that come before it
well there's no elements before it so
the output is simply the identity
element the output at the first position
here is the sum of all the elements that
come before it in this case there's one
element that comes before it
so that's copied over to the output the
output in the third element here is the
sum of all the elements that come before
it in this case the sum of a 0 and a 1
the output for the fourth element is
simply the sum of all the elements that
come before it in this case the sum of a
0 a 1 and a 2 and so on and so finally
you reach the final element and it is
the sum of everything in the array
except for the very last value that's
the definition of scan and keep in mind
again that this will apply to any binary
associative operator whether that be
multiplied max men logical operations
like and the norm and so on let's do a
simple example let's take the sum scan
of this input array 3 1 4 1 5 9 so how
do we compute the output first we always
start with the identity element then we
start with the first element 3 3 &amp;amp; 1
make 4 3 1 &amp;amp; 4 make 8 3 1 4 and 1 make 9
and 3 1 4
and five make 14 so far input here to
scan to a sum scan is three one four one
five nine
the output is zero three four eight nine
and fourteen now let's try doing an
example with a different binary
associative operator so as a little quiz
let's make sure we understand let's try
a Mac scan on an array of unsigned
integers the same array of unsigned
integers 3 1 4 1 5 9 like to ask you two
things first what is the identity
element if we do a max scan on unsigned
ends and second what's going to be the
output of this max can operation</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
