consuming Swift errors let's take a look
at how a swift method that throws would
be interpreted by objective-c here I
have a project whose main function is in
objective-c the project includes a swift
class with the following error throwing
function this function throws an error
of type my error notice that in order to
expose this enum to objective-c I mark
it with the attribute at AB to C now
we're going to call this function from
our main function we've got a variable
to hold our error in an instance of some
Swift class now let's call our Swift
function notice that xcode gives us the
option to call do something that might
fail in return error and return error
has been appended to the method name and
now we have the option to pass an error
parameter into the method cool that's
not that surprising it's pretty much the
reverse of what we saw going from
objective-c to Swift now let's see how
the error might be processed well write
a log statement and in that statement
we'll grab the domain and code from the
error that's returned and then if we run
it here's what we see in the console so
the domain and error code are
automatically populated which is super
unfortunately if you want to know the
value of the enum member that goes with
that code like weird reason or typical
reason that you can see here you can't
access it directly from your objective-c
code you have to look back at the enum
implementation it was no coincidence
that i wrote the my error enum to be of
type int let's not forget that enums and
objective-c can only hold int that means
that if you have a swift error that you
want to be consumed by objective-c it
has to be of type int unfortunately that
means that enums like this one that
provide information about the errors
right in their raw values can't be
translated to objective-c even though NS
errors aren't as spiffy as Swift errors
the takeaway here is that the interop
for error handling is mostly handled for
you NS errors just work in Swift and all
you have to do to get your Swift errors
to work in objective-c is mark them with
that
at AB see and make sure they have an
integer type</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
