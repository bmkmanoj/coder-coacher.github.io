create a function that models the orbit
of the moon around the earth we're going
to assume in this case that the moon's
orbit is perfectly circular which means
that we can model it using just sine and
cosine functions this assignment should
then help you practice translating
simple mathematical ideas into
expressions in Python so if you look
over at the supplied code right here you
can see that we've helped you out with
some pretty important parts of the code
already we've already told you that the
moon's distance from the earth is 384
million meters and we've also defined a
function called orbit for you inside
orbit you can see that the number of
time steps that we're going to look at
as the moon moves in its orbit around
the Earth is 50 we've also created a
two-dimensional array called X which is
initialized with zeros the number of
rows and X is equal to the number of
time steps in the moon's orbit plus 1
the reason for this is that if we're
watching the moon step around the Earth
50 times then the number of positions
that were actually looking at it is 50
plus 1 looking back at X we see that
there are two columns in the array one
for the horizontal position of the moon
compared to the earth and one for the
vertical position one important thing to
note is that the cosine and sine
functions from pythons math library that
we're using in this problem take
arguments that are measured in radians
and not in degrees when you finish
filling in your code here and run the
program you should get a plot of a
circular trajectory of the Moon around
the earth</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
