team as an example of what customer
relationships might look like if you
remember we keep talking about get keep
and grow but what does that exactly look
like what is it you're doing well
getting customers is just like it sounds
I need to acquire them and activate them
and if you remember the Jersey square
team said my primary channel will be our
own company website so therefore
probably a my number one way of getting
customers or Google AdWords and you can
see a little experiment that they've ran
here on the bottom and they're doing a
whole bunch of a/b testing and google
adword testing and Facebook testing but
they're trying to see whether that
hypothesis about low-cost acquisition is
possible they're also doing guerilla
style marketing on Facebook YouTube and
Twitter and they're trying to see
whether they can make their business
viral by actually having customers refer
others the key tenant of virality is can
you get other people to do your
marketing for free and they're also
gonna work on targeted promotions all
these right now are hypotheses but
pretty good starting points but later on
they're thinking about what their funnel
looks like in your two or three how are
they going to keep these customers again
these are further out hypotheses but
were thinking about customer loyalty
programs seniority credits partnership
rewards free Jersey giveaways and then
ultimately how do they grow their
customer base can they sell the customer
data can they have a family plan is not
only you wear a Jersey but you could
have your wife and children and we'll
just ship up entire a box of jerseys for
every game to you premium subscriptions
and possibly you could actually rent out
additional products like foam fingers
noisemakers funny hats etc that actually
might come in the same shipping box and
now you're getting a higher average
selling price</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
