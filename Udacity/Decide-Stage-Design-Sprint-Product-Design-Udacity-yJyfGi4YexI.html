guess it's time to come up to a decision
and to come up with one solution right
that's right
so the decide stage is important in
helping filter down the ideas that were
collected the previous stage which is
about diverging just made it so that
everyone has created a lot of sketches
and they're starting to develop some
passion and attachment to the things
that they have during the decide stage
we ask the team to put their ideas on
the board so everyone can see them at
that point we ask people to remain
silent
we call this process Zen voting just
like in the inner Zen spirit you want to
be quiet and consider things in a
reflective manner during this process we
ask people to review what the sketches
are before anyone gets to bias them with
their opinions so as they reviewed
sketches that other people have created
they start thinking what do they like
about the other solutions and you you're
always curious I made this what did the
other what what did the others make it's
fun to see that after everybody has
voted it is time to actually discuss
things in person so something that's not
natural to teams happen that's really
valuable people had individual personal
time to be creative then they had
personal time to view results and they
had time to consider and trust the vote
before anyone else could say I think
this is important and so they got biased
so now that they have gone through that
they're ready to look at things is the
community as the community the team
reviews what are the ideas or the most
popular ones and then quickly they get
to see or clearly some things rise to
the top and maybe others are less
important so their minds change based on
what the community has decided research
shows that this community based voting
can be more powerful than the decisions
of a single expert for example if you
have a horse race and experts betting on
the horses and if you have a
crowdsourcing solution in which you're
testing who
a whole crowd is making predictions on
who will win it is likely that the crowd
might often beat the experts over what
you usually think is that the expert
will be more powerful crowd first in a
decision makes the team decide faster
and it helps the team often gathered the
wisdom of everyone who is involved so
what could go wrong in this stage what
could go wrong in this stage decisions
are crucial aspect of all teams do in
fact the life of a team is made of all
of the decisions that they make so we
could not pretend that this isn't easy
there is an easy process for teams
things can go wrong if one person is
trying to overpower and put the pinyons
over others this this happens all the
time this is why we have a leader of a
sprint the leader of the sprint is
watching the entire group they want to
make sure that the introverts and the
extroverts are heard the designers and
the engineers the CEO and the intern
everyone could have a great decision at
this point so at this stage we look at
the solutions we vote and we make a call
that's right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
