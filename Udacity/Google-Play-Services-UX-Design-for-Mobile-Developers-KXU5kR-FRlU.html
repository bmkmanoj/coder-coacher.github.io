course we asked you to think about who
the end user is and their use cases we
asked you to take in consideration the
mobile user and their constraints and
now we're asking you to build
context-aware applications you might be
thinking that sounds really difficult I
would really love to make an application
that senses whether my user is asleep or
awake but how would I even go about
doing that are there api's for that why
yes there is and those api's are called
Google Play services they're an awesome
set of API that you use today to make
your applications context-aware by for
example sensing of the user's walking
sleeping running and so on remember that
chromecast example from Netflix you can
even cast to chromecast using this API
so there's a whole host of things you
can do that can make your applications
you really awesome on Android so let's
bring it back to dorm room Debbie go to
Google Play services documentation and
research it explore around a little bit
see if you can find a really awesome API
that you can use to +1 dorm room
Debbie's pizza application come up with
a really great idea and post it to the
forum</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
