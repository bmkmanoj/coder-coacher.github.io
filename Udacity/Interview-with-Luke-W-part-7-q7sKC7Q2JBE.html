approach of mobile first and the reason
why I've pushed for that is threefold
one mobile is a huge opportunity if you
look at the scope of it it's much much
bigger than what we've had before with
personal computers to mobile has new
capabilities for example with the
desktop or laptop we knew ninety-nine
percent certainty you are in the US yay
with mobile we can get you down to like
50 meters which is a huge huge
difference and there's a lot of other
capabilities like multi-touch and all
the sensors and devices that we didn't
have before but the third one which I
thought was actually the most impactful
was if you go from a typical 1024 x 768
screen down to a 320 x 480 kind of early
smartphone screen you've lost eighty
percent of your screen space which means
you need to think really really hard
about what can fit on that screen
because you can't fit everything from
before so you have to do this really
hard thing called prioritization in
order to prioritize you have to
understand what you're doing for people
why and how and when you think about all
these different devices mobile is a
great forcing function for getting you
down to the core essence to what really
matters how fast and easy can we make
this may be the watch is another forcing
function because you should be able to I
stop people like ordering pizzas with
their voice on their watch but the less
capabilities you have the more creative
you have to get with how people can get
stuff done so it's a great way to
essentially force yourself to well we
have this 40 screen check out for more
for you input field checkout form can I
get it down to five what would that take
would that even work and when you do it
on the desktop you don't have that
concern like I yeah there's plenty of
room i'll just add field number 45 on
page 30 people can type don't a
multi-device world right i think it
helps to have that filter first to get
down to the core essence and then you
can bring that core essence everywhere
because why should someone with a 20
inch monitor suffer through 40 form
fields where somebody with a 4 inch
monitor gets away with only five right
they should equally get the same
treatment</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
