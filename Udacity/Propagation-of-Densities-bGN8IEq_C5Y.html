this Gaussian I don't know I'm drawing
this it's already here a Gaussian I'll
circlet we start off with that Gaussian
we then have the linear prediction part
which does the shift we then stay but
wait a minute there may be some noise so
things get widened we take our
measurement and we sort of blend
remember it was that the Kalman filter
is a blending between your prediction
which is what our prediction here was
and your measurement and it creates a
new estimate that's a weighted average
between those depending upon the
relative uncertainties and the
uncertainty gets smaller after we take
the measurement so uncertainty gets
bigger when we do our prediction so we
don't know exactly what happened and
then it gets smaller again when we take
the measurement we said nice things
about it was that it's simple its
compact it's fish it's efficient than
it's very easy to spell the cons of it
are in fact maybe I should have listed
these in the other order here it says
will say there's sort of a restricted
class emotions defined by the linear
model linear thing we can get around by
using what's called an extended Kalman
filter a much bigger problem is it's
nice got this nice Union modal
distribution assumption you're assuming
the world really is a nice Gaussian of
some uncertainty and the question arises
what would you do if it things are not a
Gaussian so what's an example of when
you might need a non-gaussian situation
well you remember these videos okay and
again this comes from the eyes art and
Blake condensation tracking paper
there's all sorts of dynamics going on
here of things jumping around let's see
if I do that again yeah there she goes
and things move quickly they they may be
able to be nice and smooth sometimes
then something rap it'll happen so like
when the leaves are blowing in the wind
for a while they blow nicely but
basically the problem here is that
things are moving smoothly and then all
of a sudden you'll get a perturbation
and you'd like to be able to keep track
of that so graphically we're going to
show that like this okay so now we have
the same model that we had before ok we
have a an estimate from the last time we
have a deterministic shift we apply some
smoothing because we grow the
uncertainty and then
we take our measurement and we update
our estimate but now these are not
Gaussian lumps right these are sort of
arbitrary distributions and in fact this
particular figure is taken from the
paper that introduced the particle
filtering that we'll talk about in a
minute to computer vision that
condensation paper I just mentioned</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
