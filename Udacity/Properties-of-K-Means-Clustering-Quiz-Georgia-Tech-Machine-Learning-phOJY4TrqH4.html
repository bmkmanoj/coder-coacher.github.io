properties that we've been talking about
just so that they're actually written
out one is that each iteration as we go
through this k-means process each
iteration is actually polynomial it's
pretty fast we just have to go through
and look at the distance between each
Center each of the K centers and each of
the endpoints to reassign them and then
we have to run through all the points to
redefine the clusters there could be an
extra factor of D in here if these are d
dimensional points I'm sure that make
sense all right then you were just going
through the argument as to why the
number of iterations would be finite and
exponential and the exponential is like
K to the N and what you said was the
first of the n objects can be in any of
K clusters and the second can be in any
of K clusters and the third can be in
any cake Luster's so we get a total of K
to the N different ways of assigning
points to K clusters but I do think what
you said in respond to that is right
which is in practice you're not going to
do an exponential number of iterations
right right and practice it tends to be
really really quite low it just kind of
clicks into place because these can it's
the same thing for reason why the
average is even though it's a continuous
space it's still finite distance is a
really really strong constraint right
and so the error on each iteration is
going to decrease if we break ties
consistently and as you've been pointing
out to me there is one exception here
whereas if things are assigned to
clusters it could be that things don't
improve that it stays exactly the same
but that can only happen once because
then the clusters are going to get
assigned according to the consistent
tiebreaking rule and then the next time
through we're gonna see that we've
converged but there is something that we
didn't talk about that I think is really
important to think through so here's a
set of six points okay if I was going to
ask you to make three clusters of this
what would you do I'd put a and B
together C and D together and E together
indeed all right so that is the that's
the optimum here so the question is
write down a way of assigning the three
cluster centers to points so that it
will be stuck there and not get to the
the clustering that you just found so
just write down ABCDEF three of them
separated by commas defining where the
center's should start so that it'll
actually not make progress</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
