to detect outliers that work with almost
every machine learning algorithm it's
actually really straightforward and it's
very very beautiful suppose you have
this wonderful data set over here with
one outlier obviously they don't know
what the outlier is because they haven't
even discovered the structure of the
data set the algorithm is very simple
step one train with all the data in our
case it'll be linear regression to is
remove find after training the points in
your training set with the highest
visitor error and remove those perhaps
usually remove 10% of your data points
and step three is train again using the
other reduced data set and you can
actually repeat this if you want and do
it multiple times but now our example
over here what it means is the first
time we love a linear regression we get
something that looks approximately like
this and why this is not a good
regression it is good enough to
recognize that if we look at all the
residual area of the data points there's
this one over here has the largest is
happen to be 10 points so 10% removal
would remove exactly one point so we
take this point out over here our new
regression line would look pretty much
like this which is what you want</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
