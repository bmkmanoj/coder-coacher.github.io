sounds view controller and what I've
done here is that I've taken this
pseudocode that we created in the
previous video and I've converted it
into real code here let me walk you
through it
by the way all of this new code is also
available in the instructor notes for
you to experiment with first I created a
global object for a V audio engine and
then I initialized it in viewdidload
right here so the step one in our
pseudocode is done let me scroll down a
little bit to show you some of the other
changes I made in the play chipmunk
audio action now remember that this is
the method that actually runs when we
press the chipmunk button in here I
called a new function called play audio
with variable pitch and I passed in 1014
then I create an object for something
called a V audio player node so at this
point the step two in the pseudocode is
done the next step step three is to
attach the audio player node we just
created to the audio engine and I do
that right here cool we're making good
progress alright so the next thing for
us to do is to create an object of
something called a V audio unit time
pitch which I do right over here I
updated the effects pitch to the
argument this function was taking which
in this case is going to be a thousand
so our audio is going to have a really
high pitch okay step four in our
pseudocode is also done and then I
attach this pitch effect to the audio
engine so we're now done with step five
step six is about connecting the nodes
to the audio engine so I used audio
engines connect function to connect the
audio player node to the pitch effect
and then the pitch effect to an output
or the speakers so at this point step
six and seven in our pseudocode are done
okay finally I want to play the audio to
do this I will use the audio player
nodes schedule file function now
curiously enough this function schedule
file takes in an argument called file
which is going to be our audio recording
and the type of this is av audio file
I must admit at this point that we
haven't created any object with this
type previously the closest thing we
have to this AV audio file is
the very top of our program which is
this received audio now this thing
contains an nsurl to our recorded voice
so what we need to do is somehow convert
the nsurl contained within this to an AV
audio file so I googled to figure out
that I could do this by creating a
global variable for AV audio file and
then initialize this in the viewdidload
like that you will notice that I created
this AV audio file by using the received
audios nsurl alright now that I have the
AV audio file I can scroll back down and
use the new AV audio file object right
here the other two arguments can be nil
for now now I remember that the stack
overflow page suggested that I then
start the audio engine and finally play
the audio player alright it's time to
run this code and see if it works I'm
gonna hit record won't you take me to
Funkytown and then when I hit the
chipmunk button it works all of this
code is available in the instructor
notes for you to play with if you have
any questions about any of the code over
here please ask us on the discussion
