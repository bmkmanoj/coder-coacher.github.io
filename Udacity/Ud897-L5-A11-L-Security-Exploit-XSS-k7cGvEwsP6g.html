need to be careful and vigilant the
users input can be anything and it is
your responsibility to make sure it
won't break your site a clueless user
might break it by accident neither
attacker might exploit this flaw and
make a website do things that it did not
intend at all not validating user input
is one of the oldest vulnerabilities on
the web and is called cross-site
scripting or XSS for short the name
comes from the fact that JavaScript can
be injected into another side where it
gets executed and has access to all of
its sights data a typical example is a
website that asks for a user's name when
they want to leave a comment if this
input is not validated a user's name can
be crafted in such a way that it
contains JavaScript code that means that
every user reading that comment will
only see the name but the code will be
executed without the users knowledge in
the grand scheme of things this example
here is rather harmless but the script
has access to all of the sites data
including the DOM and cookies it could
even make fetch requests from the sites
origin and well-crafted XSS exploit can
be detrimental the only way you can
secure yourself against these kinds of
attacks is to follow a golden rule that
always applies in software engineering
validate your users input server-side</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
