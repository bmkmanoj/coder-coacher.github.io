starts P refers to some list that was
passed in we want the procedure to work
on any list so we shouldn't assume
anything about the list that was passed
in it could be any length and I has the
value of zero that means that value of P
index I is this first element of the
list P in the loop body we print out
that element and then we go on to the
next element by increasing I by one I
will now have the value one we go to the
next element of P we're going to keep on
going till we get through the elements
what we need for the test condition of
the while is to figure out when to stop
we learned about the len operator the
Len of a list tells us the number of
elements in the list the highest index
in the list is not the value of Len
because the list starts from zero the
highest index is the value of Len of P
minus one so we want the test condition
of the loop to make sure that I has not
exceeded that last index we could write
that condition many different ways one
way would be to use I is less than or
equal to a Len of P minus one since we
know I is an integer since we created I
initialize it to the value 0 and the
only thing we do with I is add 1 to it
this is equivalent to a simpler
expression I is less than Len of P
either of these would work as the test
condition for our loop we'll use the
shorter one since it's simpler</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
