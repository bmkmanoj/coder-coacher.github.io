the largest element in an ArrayList
again let's look at the example of our
pictures we might want to know the
largest one to know how much vertical
space we need on the wall or maybe we
want to Center them all with respect to
the largest one and then we need to know
the largest one first in this algorithm
we start assuming that the first element
or rather the element at index zero is
the largest one then we look at all
other elements and if an element is
larger by some measure than the largest
element then we change our mind and now
say the largest element is the one that
we've just seen so in this example for
example we would start out by saying oh
the first one that we've seen that's the
tallest picture then we move on to the
next one and say oh that one is taller
so I'm changing my mind and this one is
not the tallest oh this one is even a
bit taller so that one must be the
tallest now this one here is not as tall
so we'd no longer change our mind and
then the last one that we've considered
to be the tallest is in fact the one
just like we've done before
I'll now leave it to you to implement
this code in Java and this time I want
you to actually draw the tallest picture
