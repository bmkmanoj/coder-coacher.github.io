self-contained chunks of code that
perform a specific task there are three
main types of functions in Swift global
functions nested functions and methods
nested functions are slightly more
advanced so we're going to focus on
global functions and methods for the
moment global functions or functions
that can be called from anywhere in a
nap global function syntax is easy to
recognize because global functions
aren't called by a particular object
they're just called sort of floating in
thin air one global function that you're
sure to be intimately familiar with by
now is print global functions like print
can be called from anywhere within a
class on the other hand when a function
is defined in and associated with a
particular class we call that function a
method the vast majority of swift
functions that you write and call will
be methods here we have a method called
sum of strings which you may remember
from your exercises it's defined within
the arithmetic class and is also called
by an instance of the arithmetic class</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
