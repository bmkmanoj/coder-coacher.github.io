probably the most important piece of
math for this class in statistics called
Bayes rule is invented by Reverend
Thomas Bayes was a British mathematician
and impress retired minister at the 18th
century Bayes rule is usually stated as
follows p of a given B where B is the
evidence and a is the variable we care
about is P of B given a times P of a
over pob this expression is called the
likelihood this is called the prior and
this is called the marginal likelihood
the expression over here is called the
posterior the interesting thing is the
way the probabilities are reverted say
we have evidence be we know about the
but they really care about the variable
a so example B is a test result we don't
care about the test result as much as we
care about the fact whether we have
cancer or not this diagnostic reasoning
which is from evidence to its causes is
turned upside down by a stroll into a
causal reasoning which is given
hypothetically we knew the cause what
would be the probability of the evidence
we just observed but to correct for this
inversion we have to multiply by the
prior of the cause to be the case in the
first place this case having cancer or
not and divided by the probability of
the evidence POV which often is expanded
using the theorem for the variability as
follows the probability of B is the sum
of all probabilities of the condition on
a lower kept saying times the
probability of a equals no kept saying
this is total probability as you are
