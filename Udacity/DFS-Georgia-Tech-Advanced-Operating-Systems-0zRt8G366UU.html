server is that there is no central
server anymore each file is distributed
across several servers what does it mean
to avoid the unscalable 'ti of a central
server
we've only take a file and distribute it
across several different nodes in the
local ad network since the DFS is
implemented across all the discs in the
network if a client wants to read or
write a file then it actually is
contacting all the servers potentially
to get the data that is looking for and
which means that since each file is
distributed across all of these
different servers the i/o bandwidth
that's available cumulatively across all
of these servers can be used to serve
the needs of every individual client
also this allows distributing the
management of the metadata that is
associated with the files among the
server nodes that are available
furthermore we have more memories
available in all of these service
cumulatively which means that we have a
bigger memory footprint available for
implementing a file cache including all
of the server memories plus the memories
that may be there in the clients as well
and that's where we can actually go
towards cooperative caching among the
clients as well so in the extreme we can
treat all the nodes in the cluster
whether we call them s1 or c1 we can
look at all of the nodes and say they're
all the same with interchangeable roles
as clients or servers that is we can
actually make this DFS a server less
file system if we allow the
responsibility of managing the files
serving the files cashing the files
equally distributed among all the nodes
of the cluster so that the roles are
interchangeable between clients and
servers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
