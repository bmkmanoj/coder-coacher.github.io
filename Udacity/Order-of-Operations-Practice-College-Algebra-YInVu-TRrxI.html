evaluate each of these expressions we
need to use our order of operations
knowledge you need to remember our
PEMDAS for this first problem negative 2
to the third power we don't have any
parentheses so that means we need to
take the exponent into account before
the negative sign so we have negative 1
times 2 to the third power which is the
same as negative 1 times 8 so we get
negative 8 the next problem has some
parentheses in it so we need to deal
with what's inside of those first and
inside we have negative 2 squared just
like in this first problem I need to do
the exponent before the negative sign so
what's inside the parentheses here is
negative 4 since we have negative 2
squared which is negative 4 so this
equals 2 times negative 4 which is just
negative eight again the third problem
we have an exponent outside of something
that's inside parentheses so we know the
negative sign is going to be part of the
number that has taken to the exponent so
the entire quantity negative 2 is
squared so this is equal to 2 times
negative 2 times negative 2 which is the
same as 2 times positive for which is
positive 8 again we have a negative sign
inside the parentheses so it's part of
this number that is taken to the third
power so negative 2 times negative 2
times negative 2 is negative 8 here the
negative sign comes outside the
parentheses so we have negative 1 times
positive 2 to the 3rd 2 to the third is
8 and negative 1 times 8 is negative 8
our last two problems both fall into the
neither category 2 plus 2 squared is
just equal to 2 plus 4 which is six
which is not equal to either 8 or
negative 8 and here we have negative 2
squared plus 2 squared since there is
not a parentheses around this negative 2
we know that we need to square two
before multiplying it by negative 1 so
this is actually equal to negative 4
plus 4 and that's equal to 0 great job I
know this was a lot to do in one quiz
but I think that having to think through
all these different options that are
sort of similar to each other could be a
really good way to make sure you have
your order of operations sends cemented
and if you don't not a big deal at all
remember just go back and practice a
little bit more</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
