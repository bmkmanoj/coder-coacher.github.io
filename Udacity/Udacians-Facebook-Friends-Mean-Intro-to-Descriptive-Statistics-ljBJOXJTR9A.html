people entered this data on January 2nd
and that the data goes all the way down
to Selby 28th right here and it starts
at Selby - now we can calculate the
average anywhere in this white space so
let's pick this one looks like a good
cell good old cell d4 so we'll write
equals average of cell b2 all the way to
be 28 now we'll just make sure that all
of the data is highlighted with this
dotted green line that way we know that
we are accounting for all this data and
then we push enter so you should have
gotten that the average you - Ian at
least in this sample has 585 Facebook
friends another way to do that is to sum
cells b2 to be 28 and then divide by how
many people there are so there are 27
people and we get the same thing because
remember what we just did here when we
took the sum of all the data values and
then divided by n that's the formula for
the mean for any data set and that's
what you worked with earlier in this
lesson so spreadsheets are not only
useful but they're a great way to look
at the same concepts in a different way</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
