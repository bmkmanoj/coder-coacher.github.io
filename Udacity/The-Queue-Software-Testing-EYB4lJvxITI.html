testing of a specific API and that's the
bounded queue that we've already looked
at a couple times in this class so let's
take a minute and review the code for
the bounded queue so what the queue is
is an abstract data type it's providing
several methods so for example we have a
constructor and empty call full NQ adds
something DQ remove something and check
wrap is our assertion checker that does
the does sanity checking over the
internal state of the queue and so now
let's look at the simple test routine
that I wrote so what it does is it
creates a queue of two elements add some
stuff to it asserts that the proper
values are returned and removes those
things from the queue again asserting
that the proper things are returned and
notice also that we're calling check
check wrap after every cue operation
okay so this is a non-random test for
the queue what I'd like to do now is
using the Udacity API write a random
tester for the queue and so let's just
talk about this a little bit how should
it work well it's clear that the random
tests like the deterministic test here
is going to start off by creating a
queue it's also clear that after
performing any Q operation the random
test should call czech rep now the thing
that's not clear is how do we decide
what API function to call and how do we
know whether the result is correct one
thing you could do is randomly call
functions and accuse API with random
arguments and just keep asserting czech
rep and not really care what comes out
that is to say you can just randomly
invoke queue operations in a loop and
wait for czech rep to fail now on the
other hand it's not that hard to do
better so the first thing is we know how
many elements to queue holds and we also
know whether any particular addition or
removal from the queue succeeds or fails
and so it's pretty easy using an integer
to keep track of how many elements are
currently used in the queue and what
we'd like to do in that case is assert
that any enqueue operation to a non full
q succeeds and any NQ operation to a
full q fails similarly any DQ operation
from an empty queue needs to fail as we
see a little bit below and any DQ
operation from a non-empty queue should
succeed so the third thing you can do
and you don't need to do this to its
pass the quiz but but it's something
that would be nice is actually keep
track of what values should be coming
out of DQ operations and so let's just
take a minute to see what that would
look like so the bounded queue that
you're testing is based on a python
array but it turns out that it's really
easy to emulate the operation of that
cue using native python data structures
so basically if you wanted to do this
what you do is you declare a python list
that's initially empty now every time we
want to NQ something and our bounded
you we also append it to the list and we
have to be a little bit more careful
than this because if the in cueing of an
item fails we don't want to append some
store list now similarly when we DQ
something for the bounded queue if the
DQ operation succeeds we want to issue l
dot pop 0 this all the way this works is
when something gets appended to a list
it gets appended at the end and l dot
pop 0 take something off the beginning
so basically we're emulating a hue using
native python data structures and our
emulated q isn't going to be as fast as
the native q which is based on the array
but that doesn't matter for testing
purposes and so if we do these kind of
operations and we do them in a random
testing loop and we insert the
appropriate check reps then we can build
really a quite effective random tester
for the bounded queue using not that not
that many lines of code so what I'd like
you to do now is go to the API and write
the small random tester for the Q</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
