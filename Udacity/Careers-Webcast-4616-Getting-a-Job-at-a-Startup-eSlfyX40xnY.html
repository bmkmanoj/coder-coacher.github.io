more about what you do at how the Edwin
a degree has been involved in your life
yeah so I picked up an android device my
first one ever and that was very curious
about how do we build ask for it so I
picked up one of the main text books out
there and started teaching myself and
soon enough I was fortunate to land the
training position in coffee meets bagel
in san francisco and i started working
there with the knowledge that I gained
pretty much from the book that was
enough for me to hit the ground running
and contribute to the app I started
building the app from scratch and that
was a great experience however I felt
like I wanted to learn more so actually
when I started thinking myself
nanodegree wasn't even published yet so
as soon as I found out about it I
subscribe because I thought it would be
a great opportunity to to learn to
experience more to fill in any gaps of
knowledge that I had I was also very
excited to be part of the community and
see how others live see what kind of
questions other people come up with and
really that was that was like a
no-brainer I I was there that's awesome
to hear Flavius so we had a lot of
questions come from you guys today so
we'll try to get to as many of them as
we can on but we will be able to get you
all but of course we'll have some live
questions at the end um so our first
student question is what are the biases
started hiring managers and recruiters
have talked candidates to afford some
very large companies and what can the
candidates do to best address it up
these glasses there are biases I wasn't
actually uh yeah I guess just relates to
the differences between startup
companies and bigger companies the
environment in a startup company is such
that you where you'll be wearing many
different hats you might be having to
fill in different roles in a bigger
company you'd have to pretty much have a
bit like a specialist role you have a
lot of tools that are that are that are
made available to you and you have a lot
of support
so I feel like the bath could be more
carved so recruiters and hiring managers
could overcome their biases by really
focusing on the candidates ability to
solve problems and how creative they are
well do we know the company how
passionate RT about the product but
really so just to give you more context
before I worked at coffee meets bagel I
actually worked at a big company and I
knew I i knew i wanted a smaller team
and i had a few offers from different
startups I did not feel any bias so I
really think and it shouldn't be
concerned about that what they say is
that mmm like I feel like if Canada's
focused mostly on what what a truly
passionate about what what they like
doing and they find the right start up
for then things will work out much much
better and I can tell you for instance
that it cost me tobago they'd be looking
for things like like a candidate's
ability to solve problems no matter what
the obstacles are so trying and trying
again and again you don't know you might
fail even though you might not have much
support even though you've never smoked
that before just constantly trying and
trying until you succeed just not
letting it go and having a really
positive positive outlook on it another
thing to be looking at would be your
curiosity how how curious are you to
keep learning and how humble are you to
continue your learning and be a
dependable teammate and finally they
want to see that you care about
impactful work they want to see that
you're excited about how where your work
goes and does it impact your teammates
positively does it impact the customer
is positively and I bet a lot of
different startups are looking for
similar things so the reason I say you
shouldn't be concerned about bias is
that good interviewers will always have
a set of quality criteria that they're
looking that they're using to evaluate
the candidates so such interviewers will
walk into a room and they would combat
any sort of bias whether its likeness
commonalities with the candidate or
outright prejudice they'd use this
criteria to combat that bias and focus
on whether the candidate needs those
that set of criteria or doesn't and to
what degree in there doing that every
candidate will be different and the
other thing about startups is that
hiring is crucial to their processes so
sometimes hiring is more important in
growth or revenue and because of that
they'll be putting a lot of effort into
it and they'll make shortage of the
right process and time and people to
truly understand each candidate and
that's great for that's that's great for
candidates they have a chance to truly
meet each each member of the team I
remember when I was interviewing coffee
meets bagel I met everyone and that gave
me a reading good idea of how well I can
work with them and this way at the end
of the interview day we'd work for some
problems and walking out of there
everybody would know if we're excited to
come back together as a team and that's
what startups really care about it again
that's really interesting so it sounds
like startups are interested in a lot of
things and what I'm Canada to do right
and one of the things you mentioned
learning in my way we could sort of
candidates could sort of demonstrate
their learning said you guys have been
agreed it so uh following up on that
what would be the most important factor
that startups would consider why I'm
considering yeah I think I think it's
pretty much pretty much what I said in
terms of daily thinking are we excited
about having this candidate coming back
and working with us at as a team are we
excited about coming back together
working on the different problems and
they'd also look at their set of
criteria and figure out how well the
candidate matched match those those
qualities they're not going to be rigid
metrics or board anything like that the
agenda is different and I feel like
startups 11
in getting people that are different and
that's how innovation happens by having
different people come together so it's
not they're gonna have a definite list
of qualities and people have to match
them perfectly they'll consider
everything and again because they have
to I really so important so definitely
talk about your talk about your vast
experience in learning talk about your
best job talk about your your courses
that you're doing to talk about what
you've achieved in your nanodegree talk
about what's the hardest thing you've
solved what did you have to try and even
if you fail how did you overcome some of
the obstacles and yeah yeah so you
mentioned all the things that likes or
startups to give you some cereal and
pirate head if you really barely respond
so I've been release of one thing right
um but not as a mission like to mention
on they should work on it all of these
things right so how do you suggest if
they prepare for the actual interview I
want to say just go about your daily
business and do nothing that would be
bad advice even though hectic things can
get is it's definitely harder to prepare
but again you definitely should put the
time in that I want to say I learned
that my training position just by
showing up it wouldn't be too far from
the truth obviously I do advise if it's
a skill if it's a particular skill as
your that you'll be using make sure you
practice that and you're able to display
ability during the interviews also make
sure you pause for a little and take
some time to think about your projects
think about all the previous points that
I mentioned what what what what
difficult things you've done before yeah
I really everything boss about it think
about it lists your projects write
things down if you must and then have a
conversation with someone talk talk to
someone about all of this and walk them
through in as much detail as possible
given you'll be given you'd be
interviewing probably a lot with with
startups
I think they want to see a lot of detail
from you it's best to practice in
advance and make sure you can watch
someone someone who's never heard it
before walk them through from beginning
to the end um so like when they're
practicing that these things like what
do you recommend like you're really
practicing those because somebody might
be wondering officially like we did work
on algorithms and we're going to be a
sort of question at the start interview
I'm doing really to learn on my I my
android core knowledge and it'll be
instilling spit that awesome interview
um in terms of algorithms I think the
community is fairly split here some some
companies will ask you to do white board
of interviews and basically write
algorithms on the whiteboard some people
disagree with us strongly because that's
not what you'd be doing during your
daily job I think you should be prepared
for both I think anybody can become
anybody should be able to really
passionate about something should be
able to pick up a marker in or whatever
then and scribble on a napkin if they
have to some algorithmic idea if that's
relevant to your future job but
obviously if it's a skill like Android
development and you'd be to read for
Android roll definitely practice and be
ready to jump in to Android studio and
start coding right away Yeah right like
a sample app it might give you something
to do uh just coat it right there right
away yeah it's really good and you
actually do have interview projects for
across or negative degrees so that you
can actually practice your interviewing
skills you might get a better idea of
how the edge one degree will be after
that alright so our next question that a
student had um was what kind of absolute
employers expect candidates have in the
place where I think it's great to have
absence of Play Store apps just to show
even if they're not in the story if you
have them on your device you can show
them that's great I don't think it's by
any means and expectation and some
companies might feel like they want to
see open source contributions and that's
more relevant to if the company actually
uses some open source technology
definitely don't don't don't run out and
I give you if you don't have open source
contributions don't run and start making
some
especially if you're not too sure about
the project I think an open stress
contribution should come because you're
actually using some projects some open
source project and you're passionate
about it and you have a way of making it
better for yourself and therefore for
others but don't worry don't worry if
you don't have that too much I don't
think it would matter that much actually
well as long as they display good
ability yeah um but you can you sort of
want to see some way that they're able
to go in and their passion right and
having absolute play store is one way
and also open source contributions do
good but I mean I definitely agree I
just don't wanna make people feel like
discouraged like if you wanna if you
have an opportunity to to interview even
if you don't have something to show in
play store just show it show it on your
actual device bring bring it there or
talk about it with as much detail as
soon as you can and definitely be
excited about it that said you do have
your nano TV projects so definitely take
take those forward and publish them if
you can and that's that's always awesome
to show yeah I mean I would decorate
definitely recommend you really showcase
energy at work right because it's really
gonna help you uh and we might have some
suits dude that aren't even really
having a portfolio for a website I'm
submitting something to play store
honestly something to the apple app
store here in the IRS and agreed this
thing's will help us Pollux mentioned
and just like showing your contributions
awesome um so I next question a student
had um how many hours a day do you
program your job I haven't counted I
think this is refers to a day job in the
startup I try to stick to I'm probably
not far from the normal 40 hour week I
think there are startups out there
that's creepy enforce the rule of
maximum amount of hours they don't want
to cram too much work in the sprints
because maintaining speed and startups
very important and the you know on
developers to burn out that said
depending on I'm
where it needs to be done I feel like an
startup it is a possibility that you
might spend a whole day working on
something the night possibly in the
weekend those things do arise you
typically don't feel them if it's a good
fit for the environment and for you and
no startup should ever make you work day
in on the weekends just to keep the
program rolling that just sounds like
planning could be better or more
resources are needed and also I also
think that they probably need to spend
an extra 15 20 hours a week just for
your self improvement for continued
learning 49ers side projects I think
that's important to keep growing as an
engineer and if you're going to want to
spend that time as well it's already
becoming like a pretty pretty heavy work
week so you want to make sure you can
have that be sustainable for you yeah so
how do you really how to keep yourself
to the 20 extra hours it can be tough
for some people and some people might be
full-time job now is there generic
created so how do you stick to it that's
pretty impressive i think i can say i
keep I hold myself up to it every week
for sure or not and they'll be weeks man
you're completely offered definitely
take grace I think you gotta focus on
your help okay and it's also some good
advice i had from the from my Nana
theory experience which was booked I'm
just like allocates a couple of hours at
a certain time and it's it's as if it's
a meeting so we have to be there you
have to show up you have to do what
whatever the agenda is so if it's
practicing the skill or working on side
project uh yeah just just do that make a
calendar put it in your calendar and
stick to it and this way you get better
at learning over time too and there's
less waste time wasted time something
but I also say you have to it's also so
much myself I've paratus definitely take
one day off no thank you you definitely
need to recharge you need to like get
out of there walk do do something else
we gotta do whatever you find that
relaxes you and Reid not technical books
as well you yes that's really
interesting
I really that's why I agree with that
advice on so our next question from a
student is how and where do I find
people to contact that work at startup
how to connect with them uh well are
there any meetup groups nearby near you
are there any hackathons happening
that's sound good it's typically where
people will go to work on projects is
there aren't any near you are there any
online that you could actually take part
in and otherwise uh follow fellow tech
news reach out to companies if you have
questions I maybe someone respond but it
never hurts especially if you have
something interesting to say yeah like
good um yeah so you know obvious
especially to the lead us great just to
reiterate that can be so helpful just
like going and meeting people and like
for trying to differentiate yourself you
like reaching out on linkedin before
submitting your application we pick that
up uh yeah of course and also
additionally there is no meetup group
because it is starting on yourself yeah
if you always start a start-up not about
good at your startup defecation to it
yeah also prefer interview preparation
actually needs to this is a good point
definitely find out as much as you can
about the company you're interested in
beforehand and I don't think anybody
expects you to know everything wants you
to show up but at least researching will
get you to think of better questions to
ask once you're actually there alright
awesome um sorry next question is um why
won't go sir uh because you're seeking
for a challenge or because you are
looking to be wearing many many
different hats or you're trying out
something that you've never done before
ah because you want to learn definitely
and I see because you wanna have fun as
well yeah so a lot of fun was a lot of
our dating it's a lot of fun while
learning that sounds like yeah sounds
pretty good actually yeah yeah is there
anything like you have to sacrifice is
like working for soda um not if it's too
I'd start up for you yeah yeah oh that's
a good all right also um so the next
thing next question we have is how true
is to believe that a job at I start
especially early career is more about
learning and then lots of
responsibilities pressure us about
healthy paycheck that's why Sir Charles
versus other as an Android developer
suppose this is kind of like um tific
telling off the last question we had um
but maybe explain like um like how do
you want to take this question there's
Henry lon responsibilities and pressure
do you feel like it's more about what
you're learning and what you're doing
then about paycheck or ends like do you
think there would be a situation when
you want to take a job at a different
country rather than start well first to
see the context here I guess other
options would be and development and
bigger companies all right so I think
startups should create an environment
for you in which you are able to learn
you're able to experience you are given
the power to to innovate on the product
to bring new features and really see
your work being backs well now you can
achieve the same things that bigger
companies too and there are those bigger
companies that feel like I start up to
or a smaller teams just a matter of I
guess how oh aight aight is dumb
don't sit on a high paycheck if you're
not learning anything yeah especially
because that will hurt you in the long
run and making a mistake early honest
it's going to hurt anymore I think
especially when you're when you're
trying to learn but that that said I
don't think if you do find the right
start up and I I think I think you
actually feel really happy you feel you
feel that you feel like you're improving
and definitely try to get to know your
worth and know the market and find if
you're interested in startups find one
that meets your objectives for the
product the project the team and also
your of your of your financial goals as
well and I feel like startups that are
well-grounded will have no problem
fulfilling all of all of the
schools and also bear in mind that
well-rounded startups to not necessarily
mean startups that have raised a lot of
money or have very high valuations I
think that well-rounded startups are the
ones that have had a solid grounding to
begin with that was focused on metrics
which are keen to the customer so
startups that have focused on a good
product and although it's not
fashionable in Silicon Valley to focus
on revenue I feel like that's actually
not a bad idea and many startups that
are well-rounded focus both on the
customer and the revenue model and
ending successfully gathered together a
really good team and remember the hiring
is important for them you know it's very
interesting um so now we're going to
jump into a lot of Q&amp;amp;A um so Flavius you
see any question particularly here that
seems particularly interesting to you so
if you have any questions go ahead and
post them in a few days session for the
guests just click select yeah is it too
late to start programming when I'm 23
years old no not at all it's absolutely
never too late we've seen at least
around me I've seen developers very much
much later than that and becoming really
successful or developers that have
absolutely no technical inclination
before you know and they just start
learning it yeah I mean I don't really
think there's any time in her life for
you it's too late to start developing
really it is there's nothing that's
going to change is the older bird your
mind is just going to shut off I can't
understand program it anymore I so I
think it's nothing not too late i mean i
started at 18 and 23 down so I mean
what's happening you could probably
won't take you as long as it took me to
get to the program now so good yes
that's that's another advantage it may
be started later you'll have more
maturity yeah better organize yourself
yeah you can
organize your week and agrees everything
that they might not have been earlier
yeah got a second I really wish the
nanodegree Chris Brown when I started
Android yeah the challenge tear was
kinda finding that we learn in there was
there was nobody around me to have as a
role model or anything yeah so just
picking up a book was it was a little
hard but especially today that we have
all these great resources yes I know
should be greater yeah really it really
helped me with my own programming when I
didn't agree okay that's good uh stare
stare is there a remote job market yeah
there certainly is i have worked
remotely before and what can i say there
I think there are freelancing websites
where you can sign up and do contractual
work but there are also a lot of
companies that hire remote developers
there's obviously some problems to solve
their regarding yeah contracts hiring
the leak legal issues as well as not
being there the team so even if you work
remotely I think it's important to
understand whether that's something for
you but that's something that you can do
in terms of how I would make you feel
especially if the rest of the team is on
site and if you're the only team member
that's a way and I'm not sure if this
question also refers to the fact that
maybe there is no on-site option yeah so
definitely figure out if that's
something for you and make sure you get
out of the room and don't spend too much
time I say just working remotely all the
time alone yeah yeah I think it's good
to go yeah still still we reach out to
people yeah I would definitely agree
with Holly poison obvious said um I mean
I have done remote like myself and a lot
of startups and even bigger companies
nowadays are pretty open suited we don't
worry um even if even even Udacity so
when you graduate from in your head
and you could apply to babe overdo it
and that would be something right
there's different there's a lot of
different things you could do and
there's a lot of those silk intuitive
yeah there is a good job Mike thanks for
the question all right let's go what is
the minimum viable level of skill to
start working as a productive developer
how do you measure that that's that's
actually the good question here you
could say that you could measure that in
terms of output ah but if it's the kind
about but that gets hacked a lot due to
security flaws or it is the kind of
output that that is difficult to extend
so the kind of software that it fulfills
the tasks but you push it out there and
then when when the team wants to expand
on it it's not possible due to its
architecture so I think there are there
are a couple of points here to consider
yes so basically when you're at the
point where you develop something that's
skill it's something that you can write
code and other developers could look at
it so you're like yeah yeah I think
that's key like if somebody else could
pick up your work and build up on it I
think I think that I think then got to
be a good measurement for your ready to
work the team yeah otherwise you're
taking it in and agree we have the
project reduce and our code reviewers
will look more work to make sure is that
following right so i would say after
most of our new degrees you're pretty
ready to have the minimal vial of skill
to start working as a productive
developer Oh sanity 49 degrees that our
book about the beginning level and maybe
even if you're in the beginning and
agrees you could do that um so yeah this
yeah I actually pick fruit of that point
I I agree like the code reviews from my
projects could have been very useful so
I've been getting a lot of advice from
that I definitely see each other people
and show show your code request request
feedback and then help me get better at
the craft and the whole bottle now maybe
experience doesn t help me help me get
better so I say if you complete the
nanodegree you should be you should be
job ready yeah chief is yoga hot
projects the house code that spinner
you and your other certification get
Italy coupon today okay um well it seems
good two different parties well I guess
their whole good question there a lot
there a lot probably nothing at all to
all of them but we have a half of our
lives at this one kiss um what do you
believe will best help us find the
position after we complete our
nanodegree in other words what else can
we do to learn that will make us jump
ready so so I figure out something on
yeah so um I can complete the nanodegree
you guess it provides a lot of services
help you right so as you're going
through the nanodegree make sure you're
giving your career projects right if you
got your resume review your LinkedIn
review all of these things are gonna
help you find a job after you graduate
and when you graduate from the negative
creep on you will be able to be looked
up by recruiters in our nanodegree
profiles right so you'll have a public
profile on from your Nana degree and
people would be able to fine-tune
recruiters will be able to ponder but
it's also about me practice well I guess
some stuff you said a writer flop it's
just like going to meet us and just like
using all the resources you better
manage to you know if you know somebody
that developer will talk to them and
maybe get more insight if your other
development friends right so it's
combination of networking being able to
showcase your skills and just using the
tools that are available available to
you inside the nanodegree in elsa is the
Senate oh no you pretty much you pretty
much said that I think yet like cool so
we're looking for a next question here
um quite a few yeah all right here's a
quick answer um so one of the startup
requires for example 16 years of any
droids balm experience should i apply
for this position afternoon graduation
yeah so
well yeah you should definitely rip off
I write because I'm something like when
you look at the Android native your
timeline or maybe some of the other
energy timelines and says like six
months two years and pleated whatever
right and lichen animators are fairly
good right here you're learning a lot
and your new building products so you
might even have more experience than
those people that have been developing
for 12 to eight years um and also when
you look at on a job listing and if you
see um positions that require more than
what you think have well you think more
Skills than you think that you have that
doesn't mean you can't applies to this
is when I recruiters build these sort of
jobless things this is kind of a
wishlist right on you don't necessarily
need to have all these things and I
don't definitely encourage you to pause
attack Iraq it's not right I'm taking
the fun oh yeah I can take that so uh
someone who's taking a front-end web
developer Navy program you could just go
I'm taking the front front end web
developer nana TV program but i am
applying for a front-end job it startups
I don't have a wizard but that's great I
don't have much knowledge about it right
now but is there a chance startups would
be understanding of that or are they
just looking for the best like I said
there I think a good startup environment
will have a clear set of criteria that
they're looking for in candidates it's
not gonna be one thing it'll be a mix of
things obviously if you feel like you
you could use more skill I think you
could fight that back by saved by by
demonstrating that you are able to to
learn really fast and pretty much show
up and get the ground running and and
learn learn on the job and
is where that positive attitude kicks in
and up trying and trying even though
there might be obstacles and if you if
you feat if you have if you've had those
kinds of experiences before in other
fields or anything else I don't think
that should stop you from from applying
yeah there's different levels of
expertise suburbs are looking for right
asserted might not be looking for a lead
developer who has that marksman case
they might be looking for two developer
who's ready to learn maybe it doesn't
have right so right I mean yeah you
might find a really good role that will
actually be a great opportunity to learn
if you find someone if you find a start
off with a senior developer in it and
they will take you on as a junior and
then you'd have a mentor and that's
that's perfect yeah really same you like
a cookie for the best like it's really
hard to say if anyone is good best and
you know just kind of charter bus into
your best that's sort of right all right
it's the next question are there bats to
a light every sat
look at that oh yeah sure so with a
million apps on the google play store uh
I think it's far more than that right
Missy's oh yeah there's more come on it
more than I think it's yeah yeah okay so
it's definitely growing is the android
app market for the bath saturated um is
there really a great need for four
deaths in the enterprise that's like a
second question but the the first
question i don't think there's
saturation per se for things that are
needed for quality products that people
use i think that's that's a job that
lady needs to so that's that that's
problem at the plate team needs to solve
in terms of figuring out how to promote
those those good apps but that doesn't
change your approach in your desire to
build something greater so I mean even
alone there made millions of apps out
there okay the Garrity like nobody's
gonna build the same app that you're
gonna build right it's not who the
examples in is always room for more
different variations and what stars are
doing is search for solving very
specific problems right and because
they're solving soda fountain said
there's billions of people in the world
that have bottles there's one familiar
too fast and probably going somewhere
it's yeah and I guess the second part is
they're great need for devs in the
enterprise I'm actually not sure about
that one it refers to uh just like
enterprise software or larger companies
and definitely there's a need for
developers across many different
segments and many of them we don't even
know about yet there are jobs that we
didn't think in here about double Papa
in the next few years yeah especially
things like VRA our AI mobile Android
will stay there and it will be very
exciting to see we're already industry
goes yeah okay next question oh if you
haven't gotten your questions answered
yet make sure to submit it here and I
thought the questions that you do like
let's see it's really weird is the world
um I can do that one this one other bad
startups to apply to and are there any
red flags to watch out for so maybe
something I've touched upon before make
sure their well-rounded just having a
high valuation or having raised a lot of
money doesn't necessarily mean there are
healthy start up I'm I'm sure it's more
difficult to find out before being hired
what the environment is like there what
the motivations are but you can you can
kind of tell just from the interviews
just walking in and it's you
interviewing them as well so you should
understand what what drove the founders
to create the project and who who are
they or the other employees we meet
everyone on the team I mean they're not
that big so if you can definitely meet
everyone and talk and speak to them and
understand what what attracted them to
that company so these are just some ways
to get a better get a better picture and
I should also say that I think a good
startup environment has complete
transparency an idea that come from
anywhere an opinion to come from
anywhere and it matters it's big it
should be an environment in which that's
more truths eccentric it doesn't matter
whose idea it was it just matters that
the truth stands and the most the most
relevant action will be taken to improve
the product and most of the times you
see healthy startups spending eighty
percent of their time on the top 20%
most critical items and then you should
have full transparency into what the
founders direction is what their vision
is and also product roadmap you should
be filled in on all of those yeah it's
really just about research this is like
i'll just recommend googling started it
and if this is seriously about sort of
to our channel for and there's notify as
you might see the first thing that pops
up on you google I'm sorry I'm glass
door or like yeah glass to is great
place to look here I'll see how many
stars become Escott
working there if there's nothing
available maybe look up hook them up on
the outer crunchbase i'm french fries
website where you can see on information
about haha who got funding from
punishment again hat right if you're
interviewing a startup that has two
people no funding they might not be able
to pay you right so just like super
being cognizant at base like that it
like be kind of sin of who these Sutter
founders are like if it's this father
was a HP before that like be even if
it's earlier than up you can sign it
that's gonna be good sir right so just
any attention to the founders funding
and here just like do your research yeah
yeah definitely if you understand the
background of the founders dip that
they'll be a great way that would be a
great great indicator if there are
people that have maybe even found that
other startups before and now that
they've simply moved into moved into a
different direction and also yea i meant
to city regarding not getting favorites
like that so I feel like issued the
transparency of the environment should
give you a clear picture of what the
runway of the startup is and how much
time they have if locking onto their
costs how much how many months it would
be before they actually ran out of money
but of course that assumes they're not
going to have a further fundraising
round or that there's that there will be
absolutely no changes and down the
runway should make you feel comfortable
and should allow you two should should
fit well with your goals in your career
at the time that that you're thinking of
joining them there should be no secret
and I think it's sad to see sometimes
people getting getting laid off the
unexpected or only are so if you do
research normally don't have to worry
about um so we have a question here best
way to find startups and did is leaked
in anything else you suggest and we sort
of touched on this question a little bit
before sin my question about how to find
start but there's an another site called
Angeles I gently reckon to Allah the
URLs angel CO and super awesome
basically if you go up there create a
profile and after you create your
profile
if you go ahead and do to say how much
just in the startup Justin just arrested
without even really my and if it starts
interested you you can go ahead and sort
of have a conversation right on that's
one thing I recommend checking out I
mean there's just like a whole bunch of
resources out there I mean like try to
develop your online presence to start my
reach out to do like the like Dupree may
be a professional Twitter that you can
tweet it out like the school startup or
tweet about all the stuff your lettering
and then somebody might like a person's
will engage I can start a service or
teaching on some Android on your own I
like write a blog post about whatever um
playing their library whatever you're
working on and just like you will like
do so many things you can do so yeah
that's one way that's what I would
recommend anything else definitely all
of all of what you'd support what you
said and I would also say that a lot of
the startup hiring is mostly done
through referrals or just through
meeting people and as he really want to
be an odorless um not not just an online
presence definitely would help as well
but it's also a matter of having
something in common with that startups
product or direction or the technology
they're using so with a start-up is
using Android and you write a lot of
Android libraries that might be a great
indicator that they might want to have
you around so definitely getting
involved with the same environment that
that started all fruits in as well yeah
I think what's definitely some good
points let's see next question
um alright so we have like 15 is left
there are some interesting questions
here I made a lot of the stuff we
already covered and some stuff like just
isn't relevant um so if you want to see
a moment um answers to your question you
could go ahead and watch this after it's
over um but is there anything else you
wanna have you have any stories from
working at coffee meets bagel you were
the one of the first people to create
that have you had a good experience
using it yeah well I do have to mention
he was it wasn't just me there was it
was a team of three that bill t Andrew
that yeah and yeah it's been a
tremendous experience just being able to
work there in program a third of the app
and build it from scratch and launch it
in about three months yeah and see it on
Play Store see people use it here the
success stories hear the feedback I
think it's a i think is a like working
on working on consumer products
definitely is it's very different from
working on SDKs or working on working in
bigger companies or back end first of
all I learned that I you can't really
please everyone it is impossible there
will always be someone that is that
didn't like something that that you did
and that should never ever put you down
yelling in any way quite the contrary
you should take all that feedback and I
know prioritize didn't see how many see
violent coup focus on fixing the things
and building the things that a lot of
people care about first and that's
that's essential for for a startup I
think and also I think it I think it
feels really good to see the product to
be successful and actually have people
writing back in and saying thanks so
much for everything that that just feels
really good and it just makes you want
to work harder that's really cool so do
you think android netic it was like the
Phil it's on your desk I'll enjoy
creative it's like do some pockets on
the internet agree like take summer
courses and then like go back black oh
yeah you know I remember that
this is what I need to yeah actually
some like when I I mean I had thinking
you've already gone through the app
building process but it definitely be
launched oh and I was videos I was
weighed this point that I really wished
I could have finished that before
because I I do i do love learning in a
more structured way filling in all those
gaps in order and sometimes mostly when
in any job or in your aircraft things
will always come nicely packaged and
ordered yeah so you just have to move on
and come back to it later if you don't
understand something just abstracted use
abstraction abstraction is the keyboard
yeah just going to come back to it later
and you understand it so the nanodegree
actually helped me fill in a lot of the
knowledge gaps i had and i also learned
learn new skills like I I came back and
said hey you know like I I just learned
how to use the loader and I didn't know
before no and we have a listview why
don't we just put that 20 20 20 this to
you that the list you to a loader yeah
and then we have our data coming in
nicely and that's probably better than
the way we're doing it so I had some of
them knowledge come back into my into my
work as well oh that's really cool it's
really cool to see on that so uh it
looks like we're pretty much good
questions that's pretty much done it I
just like to thank you one more time
polish for taking the time out of your
day I'm joining us here it's been really
great is there anything else you want to
talk about no thanks very much as well
for listening and for all the great
questions I hope you'll enjoy
programming hope you enjoyed the
nanodegree and look forward seeing some
great projects out there great awesome
