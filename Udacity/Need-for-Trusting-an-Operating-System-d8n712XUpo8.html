system and I'm going to talk about
exactly what does it mean to trust a
system by that set of differentiates an
operating system from other applications
that may not be trusted so why do we
need to trust it in fact not only we
need to trust it but we actually also
call it a trusted computing base let's
see why do we call it a PCB or a trusted
computing base it is the base in some
sense if you don't directly want to deal
with the hardware we said applications
run on top of the operating system so
the operating system really is the
computing base that is seen by the
applications or the user processes the
need to trust to the operating system
comes from the fact that we're giving it
the keys to the kingdom case to the
kingdom here our direct control of all
the physical resources so the operating
system in some sense is able to access
anything that we have and then it's the
job of the operating system to make sure
that these resources or whatever
high-level resources we implement using
the low-level physical resources get
accessed by the correct users in the
system or the correct applications and
if you're going to make some one sort of
the in-charge or the controller you
better be able to trust it that it's
going to do what it's supposed to do
otherwise the results that you're gonna
have you will not like them so that's
why there's need to to trust an
operating system so what exactly does it
mean for us to be able to trust the
operating system so what are the
requirements that should be met by this
trusted computing base that we say has
such an important role in protecting our
resources first of all the operating
system absolutely has to be between the
untrusted applications and the physical
Hardware resources that we have this is
called complete mediation think about a
request coming from an untrusted
application and address this request is
for a resource that is being requested
by the application
it has to go through the operating
system the operating system has to
mediate this request and you can think
about why that's necessary it's
necessary because we have the operating
system has to check that the resource of
the request actually has access is
allowed to gain access to this resource
and for that check to happen the
operating system has to be come between
the request and the resource so that's
called complete mediation yeah you can't
get to any resources that require that
need to be protected without actually
going through the operating system so
trusted system is always going to take a
look at any requests before it actually
reaches the resource and the source of
that request is able to access that
resource so the complete mediation
requirement is the first one the second
requirement a trusted computing base has
to meet is what we call it has to be
tamper proof in fact we're going to
spend a bunch of time how to to achieve
that or how to meet that requirement the
reason it has to be tamper proof is that
we're talking about untrusted code and
in the trusted computing base or the
trusted operating system well if the
untrusted code can tamper with the
trusted operating system you can't trust
any more the untrusted code tampers with
it changes it to do whatever it wants
done in particular gain access to
resources that perhaps were not meant
for this untrusted application which may
be compromised could be malicious third
requirement is the so-called correctness
requirement if you're going to call a
system trusted you're going to
completely rely on it to make sure that
you're protected resources get used in a
proper way then however it does that
whatever functionality is implemented by
the trusted computing base it should be
done correctly because if there is a
one-er ability or a bug or some error in
the trusted computing base or the
operating system I said it has the keys
to the kingdom
so we said operating system is has to be
trusted now we know what it means for it
to be trusted
you shouldn't be able to bypass it
that's complete mediation you have to go
through it you can't alter or change it
if you are an untrusted application and
whatever functionality it implements
that's done correctly</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
