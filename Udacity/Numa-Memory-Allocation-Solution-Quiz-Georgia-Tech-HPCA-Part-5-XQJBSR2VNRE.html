quiz in order to improve performance of
a Numa machine the operating system
should really put all data pages that
are mostly accessed by a single core in
the memory slice local to that core that
will ensure that most of the accesses by
each of the cores are going to the local
memory which both make sure that
accesses will be quicker than they
otherwise would be and also the network
will not be used for the majority of
accesses so this should be selected if
we however put all data pages ever
touched by core and in the memory slice
and then we have a problem because for
example one core might initialize all
the data and then we put all of the data
in its memory slice and at that point
that memory slice becomes the bottleneck
because everybody will be accessing that
slice and the data might not even fit
there so this is not a correct answer
and then the put the stack pages for
core and in the memory slice end is a
very extreme example of this where
really it will just be the core end that
is ever accessing this data so of course
it should be in its memory slice so the
stack is one of those things that the
operating system can figure out very
easily where to put some of the other
pages are a little bit more difficult
because more than one core are accessing
it and then the operating system needs
to choose a good location either because
one core is accessing it more than
others or to put it in a memory module
that is kind of close to all the cores
that are accessing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
