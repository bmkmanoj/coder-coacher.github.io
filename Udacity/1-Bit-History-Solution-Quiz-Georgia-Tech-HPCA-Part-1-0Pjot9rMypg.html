bit history quiz we have a 1-bit history
that starts at 0 and 2 bit counter for
each possible history or counter started
strong not taken and the pattern we are
trying to predict is then not taken not
taken taken etc after 100 repetitions of
this pattern what is the total number of
missed predictions that we will have
seen one way to approach this problem is
simply to work through the table like we
have seen before
so we will have our state the prediction
the outcome and whether we are correct
and now we will just work through the
outcomes the outcomes will be N and T N
and T etc and of course we will not go
through 100 repetitions of this pretty
soon the predictor will start to be very
consistent about what its predicting in
each round of the pattern the state
initially is 0 strong not taken strong
not taken the prediction as a result of
that will be use the 0th counter which
is saying strong not taken so the
prediction will be not taken this agrees
with the outcome so we are correct
update the predictor so the state will
be 0 because the outcome was not taken
strong not taken will be updated with a
not taken outcome so it stays strong not
taken and the other counter just stays
the same
now the predictor again will predict
not-taken using 0 and strong not taken
and it will again be correct so the
history stays at 0 the strong not taken
stays at strong not taken and the other
counter just stays the same and at this
point we will again with the history of
0 use this predict not-taken strongly
and be wrong this time
so after run round we have a single miss
prediction the history will be 1 now and
the predictor here will be updated to
week not taken because there has been a
taken outcome and the other predictor
just stays the same now we will use a
history of 1 to index a strong not taken
so the outcome will be not
they can and be correct next we will
keep the stronger taking here the other
counter stays the same the history
becomes zero because of this and we will
use a history of 0 to index into the
weak not taken state and thus predict
not-taken again again we are correct in
our decision next the history stays 0
because the decision was not taken the
update of the weak not taken goes back
to the strong not taken because the
decision was not taken the other counter
stays the same and using the history of
0 we will index and use this counter
this contest has struck not taken so we
will predict not-taken this will
disagree with the taken prediction so we
will have a misprediction this concludes
round 2 as you can see at the end of
round 2 we have the same state that we
had at the end of round 1 so now pretty
much what happened in round 2 will
repeat more times overall in the hundred
repetitions of this in each repetition
we have a single miss prediction so the
correct answer is that we have a hundred
miss predictions or one third of our
decisions are wrong as you can see the
one bit history predictor is not a great
predictor for this type of a pattern</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
