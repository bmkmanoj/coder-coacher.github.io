to mention and it really does belong in
this lecture is the effect of market
type on revenue and this is really
interesting because you might have heard
about startups about something called
the hockey stick and the hockey stick is
actually this kind of curve now it turns
out what the hockey stick really
represents our startups in a new market
Wow
well that's kind of interesting why well
if you think about it in a new market on
year one you have no customers and so
your revenue is essentially flat and
your two revenue still might be flat
year three it might be flat your four oh
my gosh something changed about the
market there might be a tipping point in
a flexion point where sales literally go
exponential and start to skyrocket what
happened is a market that didn't exist
all things have just come together and
it's become the year of online education
or it's become the year of the network
or but it's become the year of the
mobile phone or smartphone the
unfortunate part is most startups who
are in a new market see something that
look like this and go out of business so
what we're really hoping for is we could
an influence and effect this tipping
point by our customer strategies our
value proposition and our get keep and
grow strategies but the key idea is we
want to hoard as much cash as we can
because almost no startup in a new
market can affect the diffusion of
innovation by itself other things need
to happen and by the way this little
bump in year one this represents the
fallacy in new markets because in almost
every new market you could find crazy
people just like you who'd be happy to
buy one for their lab or their home or
something or just so such early adopters
they want to have one and startup
founders look at that curve and say look
it's just gonna look like this and start
scaling their sales and marketing and
spending and then it all collapses again
because it really
and just an early adopter sign not
mainstream adoption so we want to be
careful about what our sales curve looks
like now what's really interesting is if
we're an existing market and remember in
an existing market what do we know well
they're our customers and they're our
competitors and what we have is by our
definition a better or higher
performance product on axis that the
customers have defined so our job in an
existing market is simply a year after
year if we execute pristinely simply to
take share away from the incumbents and
so our sales curve in an existing market
literally should be one of taking share
and finally in a reset mented market
this is kind of a hybrid of both new and
existing and what's happening in years 1
2 3 etc in the early days is you're
actually getting revenue from the
existing market that is people might
actually kind of find you or an OK
substitute but really don't understand
your unique value until some tipping
point where they realize oh my gosh
you're just not another vendor in an
existing market you actually solve
better a set of needs for a niche or
you're a low-cost supplier that really
makes you unique and special and
revenues take off and so what you have
to do is husband your cash but not as
much in a new market and figure out how
to get you differentiated from the
mainstream in existing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
