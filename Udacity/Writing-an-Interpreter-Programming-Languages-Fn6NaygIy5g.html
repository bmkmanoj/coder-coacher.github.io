started writing an interpreter together
I'm gonna write the first half of it and
for this quiz you're gonna finish it off
we're gonna write a recursive procedure
called interpret that's going to walk
over abstract syntax trees and figure
out what they mean
we're figure out what they mean is calls
a graphics library to render a web page
that's the meaning of HTML
the reason we're operating on trees
instead of just one this is mostly just
how I'm labeling it but remember that
HTML can be a collection of elements
rather than just one for example you
could write out a web page that said
hello friend
and it would be a list of two elements
so I want to make sure that we're
prepared to take a list instead of just
a single thing will immediately dispense
with that however by considering them
one at a time so now for example we'll
just do the hello remember for us though
it would look something like this we've
decided to represent our abstract syntax
trees as tuples so I'm gonna need to
pull out the zeroth element of this tree
to see what sort of thing it is so I'm
gonna pull out the node type in our
running example its word element but it
could be JavaScript element tag element
bunch of possibilities if it is a word
element I know what to do gonna call our
graphics library and say print out a
word and the word I want you to print
out is the second child of the tree so
in this example it's hello comma another
possibility is that someone has given us
a tag element something like this bold
tag begins some HTML in the center bold
tag ends well we went to all the work to
storing this information in our parser
so let's get it out now the name of the
tag we're entering is the first part of
the abstract syntax tree in this strong
text example it's just a B there may
well be some number of tag arguments for
the bold tag no arguments but for
something like the anchor tag there
might be more then there's a list of
HTML elements that we'll have to
interpret later strong text in this
example and then there's the closing tag
name here's what I want you to do for
the quiz two different things I want you
to check that the tags match and
interpret the subtree if the tags don't
match use graphics dot warning to make
that really obvious otherwise interpret
the subtree hint call interpret
recursively</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
