color spaces here's a nice picture of
all these different ways of representing
these things by the way notice the one
here at the bottom left red blue green
red green blue we'll talk about that one
in a minute alright but let me show you
what my favorite in fact I'll put up two
of them so which one's my favorite well
I think I already gave it away I told
you that the problem with this one here
is that the entire top surface is white
and so here's the question how much can
I change the color of something that's
white answer not at all
white is white is white so that's why I
like this idea of having this peak on
the top so that is you can't get far
away from it likewise same as on the
black and you spin around the double
cone gives you the hue and as you get
further out they call it chroma I
actually like calling it saturation
better it doesn't really matter too much
but the idea is I tend to think of it as
a cone and it what's important is when
you realize that it's a cone you realize
that if you're comparing and we'll get
to this a minute if you're comparing the
hue of two different patches if they're
very dark the hue doesn't mean anything
if they're very bright the hue doesn't
mean anything and that's very hard to
see on this cylinder representation but
it's very easy to see see on the on the
cone now of course what is the color
space that we all know and love or at
least know all right which is the one we
know best well it's the RGB space right
where basically you've got a cube where
and sort of its back corner where things
are zero zero everything's black if you
move down the red axis it turns red if
you move to the green axis turns green
add them together what's red and green
make yellow why cones and if you bring
the whole thing up it looks white and
what's cool is if you take that cube and
you sort of pull the white corner to the
top and the black corner to the bottom
alright so in fact I have sort of a
picture just think about that it would
be almost like a double cone not quite
it would be kind of a lumpy double cone
with sharp points but the idea is white
would be at a point on the top black
would be at a point on the bottom
and then you would have chroma as you
went around and that's why my preference
is the double comb</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
