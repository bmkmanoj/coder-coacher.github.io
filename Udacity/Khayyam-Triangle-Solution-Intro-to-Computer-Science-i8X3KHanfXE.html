build up a given row of Pascal's
triangle so you could solve this problem
recursively and that's what I did my
first time but I feel that the iterative
solution is a bit simpler and more
intuitive to understand this isn't
always the case but this is how I'm
going to explain this problem what we're
going to do is we want to start with a
list that's row 1 and then we're going
to build the next list by adding the two
numbers above it more precisely let's
say we're doing the last row and we have
the previous low already made we're
going to start an invisible zero here
and we're going to say 1 is going to be
the sum of the zero number that I just
made up and the one that's the first
element of the previous row we're going
to update our pointers to move over by
one and we get to the element four by
adding one and three we want to repeat
this process all the way through 6 is 3
plus 3 4 is 3 plus 1 1 is 1 and 0 so
that's pretty easy to explain and that's
basically how you would do it if you
were building it out by hand but putting
it out in the code maybe a little bit
more complicated and involuted eluded
you so let's see how it's done so if I
initialize the first row in the triangle
to 1 we don't have anything for a result
yet so that's an empty list I'm then
going to iterate through the process of
building each row one at a time n times
that way we get to the anthro we're
going to pend the row that we just
discovered onto the result list the
first time around it'll just be the list
of 1 because that's how the triangle
starts we're then going to find the next
row which I haven't defined yet and then
repeat this process appending the
current row onto the result list once
we're done we're going to return the
result so this is kind of a good outline
of what we're doing but we're missing
the most important part and that is the
makes next row so where I was going to
start as an empty list and as I had the
two pointers before we're going to have
the previous one and then we're going to
have one that I'm going to call E so as
I said in the description we're going to
start out with 0 that way when we add 1
we get 1 which has the sides of the
truck
we're going to calculate the new entry
in the current row by adding e that's
our right pointer with the previous one
that we start out at zero so that we get
one we're going to update the values in
previous and then the next iteration
II will update to the next value row and
this last line basically includes the
one on the right-hand side once we
return result triangle can use make next
row accordingly and we're done</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
