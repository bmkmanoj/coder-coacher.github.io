that we're going to cover in this
lecture
DFS wants to intelligently use the
cluster memory for the efficient
management of the metadata associated
with the files and for caching the file
content cooperatively among the nodes of
the cluster for satisfying future
requests for files in other words what
we would like to do is since we know
that the disk is slow we would like to
avoid going to the disk as much as
possible and retrieve the data from the
memory of appear in the network if in
fact that peer has previously accessed
the same file and that's the idea behind
cooperative caching of files but in
order to fully appreciate the question
that we are asking and the answer that
we're going to discuss in this lesson it
is important that you have a very good
understanding of file systems if you
don't have it don't worry we have
supporting lectures that will help you
get up to speed and you can get this
knowledge by diving into a good
undergraduate textbook that covers this
material well and the textbook that is
used in the undergraduate systems course
CS 2200 at Georgia Tech is a good
resource for that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
