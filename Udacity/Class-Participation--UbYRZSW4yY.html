teach you software design you have to
actively learn it to encourage this part
of your grade for the course will be a
measure of your participation in it this
is necessarily a subjective element but
I can let you know of some of the
considerations that go into it
first is your teammates evaluations of
you on the projects and assignments also
your engagement in the quizzes that are
part of the lessons third is your non
gratuitous participation on the class
forum I consider this course itself as a
design project although it has been
offered many times before it has
necessarily been adapted to deal with
the constraints of web-based delivery
and a large number of students therefore
I expect some elements will work better
than others I specifically would like to
solicit your contributions such as the
following first any bugs in the material
these can be as trivial as typos or as
Vegas questions about unclear or lesson
content if you have any suggestions for
additional content as long as the
suggestions fit within the general
intent of the course also specific
examples either generated by you or ones
that you have seen that were
particularly edifying alternative
assignments or assignment questions even
suggestions for style elements that
might be added to the course in general
the first contributor on a particular
item will get primary credit for that
contribution</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
