store transforms is that a single matrix
can hold any number of transforms at
once as an example consider object 3ds
rotation parameter here's a snippet of
code from the Euler angle demo the
airplane's three rotation axes are each
set this means that the airplane is
first rotated around its z axis then its
y axis then X internally a transform
matrix is made for each rotation then
these are multiplied together
matrix multiplication works like this
for each location in the resulting
matrix you take the corresponding row of
the first matrix and the column of the
second Matrix and perform a dot product
between these two for example to compute
element n 2 4 I compute the dot product
of the fourth row of the first matrix
and the second column of the second
Matrix this gives this set of terms here
added together gives n 2 for 16 dot
products later and you have the
resulting matrix to multiply together
our three rotation matrices we can start
at either end multiplying our X by our Y
or our Y by RZ I've decided to start
with ry and RZ multiplying these
together we get some temporary matrix U
we can then multiply together the X
rotation matrix by this temporary matrix
this gives us another matrix call it Q
which consists of all three rotation
matrices multiplied together this
resulting matrix Q can then be used to
transform coordinates when an object
coordinate is transformed by the single
matrix the coordinate in fact is rotated
by the three rotation matrices in turn
it's clearly more efficient to use a
single matrix than three the scale and
translation parameters in the object 3d
class do the same thing they create
matrices and these all get multiplied
together here's the full sequence of
transforms that happen for an object 3d
when using its parameters scale the
three rotations and translate internally
these matrices are all multiplied
together to give a single resulting
matrix M the parameter in the object 3d
class is in fact called matrix you can
now see why I've been listing the order
of matrices as from right to left as
this is the order we can use for
multiplying them together multiplying
matrices together like this is called
concatenation</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
