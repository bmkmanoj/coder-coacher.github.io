an entrepreneur when entrepreneur asks
me you know what investors should i pick
up or how should i choose my investors
the first answer I give them is just
like that lot just like I expect you to
of the fastest possible you should
expect your investors to move the
fastest possible and between getting a
great investor in three month or getting
a good investor now go for the good
investor now and then fulfill the rest
of your need in terms of people that
will help you through advisors or
anything else I think that this is good
advice in general because as I said
speed is the most important thing if you
don't have money you cannot move in many
cases you cannot hire more people and so
this is really critical having said that
you've got to make sure that you don't
get investors in it basically become a
liability on the company and the kind of
investors that could become a liability
on the company are those that are either
very bad in the way they manage the
relationship with the founders that's
one thing or those that demand all kind
of terms that would basically take away
either the control of the destiny of the
company or slow down the company and so
when I see investors that are requiring
you know extreme veto rights or they're
requiring to be the ones approving stuff
or invest I've even seen investors that
say I want to sign on amounts that the
company spends above a certain level I
stay away from these deals and the
reason is because as i said i want the
interpreters to be able to move fast and
iterate fast and if each such movement
and iteration is going to be slowed down
by investors that want to be part of it
then you know that the company is going
to have a liability that that I don't
like and so all things equal go with the
with good investors that that move fast
however make sure that you do not take
money from people that could become
liability how do you know that first of
all get a good lawyer and a ghoul or is
not necessarily one of the large firm
but it's somebody that dealt with many
startups and make sure that the lawyer
explains to you what are the terms and
the term sheet are in the contract that
are going to slow you down and these are
the ones you need to insist on on
removing the ones that sell you them the
second thing never take money from E&amp;amp;S
an investor without talking to at least
one comfort
preferably more that they invested in
just like the investor due diligences
you you need to do diligence them
because that's marriage they are going
to be together for years now and so if
you're not going to basically talk to
somebody that already worked with them
and get honest honest review of them
then you're not doing yourself justice
and just like an investor is not doing
its job if they're not doing you did it
on the company you're not doing your job
if you're not due diligence in the
investors and after all of that you know
when you get the list of people that
past your due diligence and that are
willing to move fast only then start
thinking about who's the best only then
start thing but who can help me the most
who can bring me the most value and then
when you think about who can bring you
the most value it's important to not
think about who brings me the most
Valley hands on because you don't want
your investors to be hands-on with the
business that you're building it's two
things is who gives me the most
credibility in the market because let's
say that you're building a an open table
like business then if you got an
investor which is an open table X
executive that brings you lots of
credibility with investors so that's one
thing that can bring value the other
thing is if you get access to their
network so look at the network of the
person these are the two things to look
for credibility that it gives you and
network that you can use</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
