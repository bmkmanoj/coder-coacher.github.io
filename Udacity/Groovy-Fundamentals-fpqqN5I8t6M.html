groovy so we can better understand
what's going on in Gradle build scripts
before we get started looking at code a
pet peeve of mine and online courses is
when you have to constantly pause the
video to copy down code you don't have
to do that in this course all the code
will demo is included in the course
github repository groovy exists to fill
a hole for Java developers who need a
scripting language
it's terse expressive interoperates
extremely well with Java and has some
special features that make it ideally
suited to creating domain-specific
languages Gradle even provides its own
groovy distribution so we don't even
need to install groovy we can just put
our groovy code in a build Gradle file
and ask Gradle to do any task that uses
the file to start off with will declare
a task called groovy that doesn't do
anything we'll be talking about this
syntax in a minute don't worry about it
for now all this is doing is just
telling Gradle to go ahead and load this
file if we go ahead and run that task by
running Gradle groovy what we see is
that Gradle runs the groovy task but
doesn't really do anything that's what
we expected alright let's dig into
groovy and you know where you have to
start right of course we got to start
with hello world let's try running this
build script again and see what happens
all right
we see our message we've successfully
reached hello world let's do something
more interesting
most Java is also valid groovy let's
test that out by creating a very simple
Java greeter class just has one method
say hello and prints hello Java to
standard out if we create an instance of
that class and then tell it to say hello
let's see what happens
remember this is groovy not Java let's
run our Gradle groovy task again and
there we go hello Java Gradle is an
optionally typed language that means
that you can give all of your variables
types if you want to but if you don't
feel like it you can declare variables
just using the DEF keyword in this case
we're just declaring a variable called
foo value 6.5 we can also execute simple
groovy code inside a string by creating
a block of curly braces preceded by a
dollar sign while dynamic typing is
really nice sometimes it is good to know
the class of a variable we can do that
simply by calling dot class on any
variable finally dynamic typing also
allows us to reassign a variable to a
different type this isn't very good
practice but
it's good to show off alright let's give
this code a try awesome
looks like foo has value 6.5 yep that's
what we expect down at this line looks
like five plus six does indeed equal
eleven looks like groovy was nice enough
to do this math for us and then finally
it looks like foo is of class Java mouth
big decibel when it has a value of six
point five but then when we reassign
food to a string looks like foo now has
the class java.lang string let's have a
look at how to declare functions in
groovy looks somewhat Java like but note
the DEF out front instead of a return
type also we don't need a return
statement the last expression in the
function block is what's returned so
this function takes its input and
doubles it we can call it with a number
however since plus is overloaded in
groovy we can also call it with a string
let's check out the output of these
indications have double it alright looks
like double it if the argument five
gives a ten and double it with the
argument the string fubar gives us fubar
fubar fantastic there's one more super
cool feature of groovy and that is
whenever a function is called with at
least one argument and it's unambiguous
you can usually leave off the
parentheses let's give that a try I've
set us up with three functions here one
of which no args one of Monarch one with
two args
let's see what we can do if we go ahead
and call our one arg function with some
argument and we don't put any
parentheses around it well let's see
what happens
hey we successfully called the function
I'll write now let's give the two
argument function a try
note we still have to separate the
arguments with a comma all right let's
see how it goes beautiful no parenthesis
still getting a function call let's see
if we can pull the same trick with the
no argument function looks like
something exploded turns out you can't
use no parentheses when you're invoking
a function that doesn't have any
arguments otherwise groovy is confused
about what's going on all right let's
try something real hard now we're doing
a nested function call so we've got two
arcs and then the first arc to two args
is one Arg past 500 and then 200 is
going to be the second Arg for two args
you think this is going to work let's
give it a try
hmm looks like something broke looks
like there's something weird going on in
here turns out this is actually
ambiguous
it's not clear to groovy whether you
want to pass two arguments to one arg or
what's going on here fortunately we can
make this unambiguous with just a couple
parentheses around 500 now that we've
added those parentheses let's see if it
works now
beautiful we're getting the nested
function call exactly how we want it
first the one our function is being
called then the two arc function is
being called</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
