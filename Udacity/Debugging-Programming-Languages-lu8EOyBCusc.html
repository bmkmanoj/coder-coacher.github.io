interpreter in a web browser we will
make mistakes and in fact even a single
word flip can be deadly consider this
hypothetical utterance from Joan of Arc
I would rather have a sandwich then be
burned alive up here we've got the
sandwich here we've got the fire the
meaning of this single word really
really matters in this sentence then
actually means and subsequently for most
of us I would rather have a sandwich and
subsequently be burned alive is not
actually what we would go for so the
difference between then and then a
single word in a natural language
changes the meaning almost entirely Joan
of Arc was a French national heroine and
martyr and although it's easy to imagine
these sorts of single word flips in
natural languages we're going to see the
same problem in constructed languages
like java script or HTML we're going to
have to get every word right in order
for the meaning to be correct and this
is a big project that means we're knee
we will need to focus some of our
efforts on removing or finding mistakes
and that process is called debugging in
computer science for example suppose
when we were writing out the
if-then-else part of our JavaScript
interpreter we made a single mistake we
pull the conditional expression from the
one that amount of the tree we pull the
then branch from the second element of
the tree we pull the else branch from
the third element of the tree then we
evaluate the conditional expression in
the environment and if it's true we
execute the else statements and if it's
false we execute the then branch
statements did you catch the mistake
we've swapped these two lines if the
conditional comes out true we will
mistakenly go to the else branch the
conditional comes out false will
mistakenly go to the then branch will
get almost every program incorrect but
not actually every program and this is a
skill in debugging what we want to do is
make a test case a sample JavaScript
programmer web page that will show off
this mistake where the answer won't be
what we expected so here I've written
down for candidate JavaScript programs
that we might use as test case
is to notice this mistake in this
multiple multiple choice quiz what I
would like you to do is select each test
case that will actually show off the
mistake that is imagine our interpreter
has this bug in it and we feed at this
input will we get the same answer we
expect from reasoning in our minds or
will we get something different if we
get something different than what we
expect then we know there's a bug and we
can get started on fixing it which of
these inputs will highlight this bug</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
