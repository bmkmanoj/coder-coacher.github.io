when we have an intervention we need to
write to memory every time we have a
cash to cash transfer so for example c1
has the Block in the M State because it
just wrote it
c2 wants to read the data so it puts a
read request on the bus c1 responds with
the data
so now c2 has the data but c1 can no
longer just write to this block so c1
gets the Block in the shared state c2
gets the Block in the shared state and
that's why the memory had to grab the
data when c1 was responding now what can
happen is c2 writes so it sends an
invalidation cuz it already has the data
now C one gets the invalid state C two
gets the modified State
and then let's say this read write
behavior moves to a another core like c1
so pretty much if one core reads and
writes then another one reads and writes
and so on we can have a repetition of
this so pretty much the data is kind of
moving around the caches but the problem
is every time it moves between caches
the memory also gets written and the
memory doesn't have as much bandwidth as
the caches do so the problem really is
that here we need it to do a memory
right another problem occurs because
when c2 has written for example and has
the data in the modified state and then
c2 responds with data and that causes a
memory right we again get c1 has the
Block in shared state c2 has the Block
in shared State
now if C 3 reads because both of these
have the Block in the shared state the
memory provides the data so we have
memory reads here even though one of
these could have responded with the data
if we only knew which of the two should
respond definitely both of them should
not respond so if we had a way to tell
which one of them should respond we
could avoid this memory read by the one
that is responsible for responding
providing the data as long as there are
new requesters this can happen a lot of
times so if another quarry it's same
thing we get the memory read although
now there are three
course with the data in the shared state
and so on we want to avoid the update to
memory as long as there is a cache that
still holds the most recent value of the
block and we want to avoid memory reads
if there is a cache that can provide
this block because again memory
bandwidth is a lot lower than cache
bandwidth and also memory reads and
writes are a lot more expensive in terms
of power and latency than cache reads
and writes but to do this we need to
make a non modified version of the block
in one of the caches responsible for
giving data to other caches when they
want it
so that the memory doesn't need to
respond and eventually writing the block
to memory so that the memory doesn't
need to be updated every time we do
something like this so what we really
need to know is which of the shared
copies is the one responsible and we
will know this by introducing another
state called all which stands for owned
so there will be one owner of the block
if others are sharing it the O state
will behave just like the shared state
except that whenever there is a request
for the data in the block the owner is
the one of the shares that gets to
respond and also if the owner replaces
the block from the cache it gets to
write back to memory so that we ensure
that memory gets updated</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
