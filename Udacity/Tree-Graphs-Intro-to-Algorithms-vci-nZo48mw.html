we needed to do is to see if the graph
is connected looking through the eight
graphs and see that the fourth graph is
not connected recoloring the edges you
can see that these three nodes are not
connected to these three nodes so this
one can't be a tree all the other graphs
are connected the next thing we need to
look for our cycles the second graph is
a ring and it's obviously a cycle and in
the seventh graph there's a cycle
between these four nodes connected by
the edges in pink and so that can't be a
tree and so that leaves these other five
nodes all of which are trees now some of
these like this one it's kind of obvious
that it looks like a tree but the eighth
graph doesn't really look like a tree
why do we call it a tree graph what we
can do is number and rearrange the nodes
to make it look like a tree there's
seven nodes in this graph and I've
numbered them 0 through 6 let's start
rearranging this let's start with node 6
now node 6 is connected to node 2 so
we'll draw that connection and node 6 is
also connected to node 1 so there's that
edge you can see that node 2 is
connected to node 4 and node 5 and so we
can draw in those nodes and the edges
and then node 1 is connected to node 0
and node 3 so here are those nodes and
edges drawn in we can see that we can
transform this graph which doesn't look
like a tree at all into something that
looks a little bit more like a tree it
branches out so hopefully that gives you
some idea of why we call these tree
graphs</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
