let's look at an example of computing
the LP just so that we can be on the
same page about that first we need a
program so let's say we have this
program we have already renamed it so
that only the true dependencies remain
so now let's look for those through
dependencies we write to p10 this
instruction doesn't use p10 actually the
first one that uses p10 is this one we
write to p6 nothing uses p6 we write to
p5 this one uses be fine so there is a
dependence basically here and another
one here and then here we produce before
so we only have really these two true
dependencies so now let's look at like
what can execute in which cycle to do
that the best way is to just kind of
check off instructions and counter
cycles so in the first cycle we can do
this this this and this cuz none of
these instructions has any incoming
dependencies yet in the second cycle
okay this one cannot be done in the
first cycle because it has a dependence
from this and this and that's not been
done in the first cycle yet so after the
first cycle all of these are done so now
we can do this so what we have what we
get is now the ILP is equal to how many
instructions five over how many cycles -
we got an IP of 2.5 again we didn't need
to know what the process looks like
now some convenient tricks for computing
the ILP first I didn't actually need to
rename the program if this program had
real registers with some anti and output
dependences I could just fake renaming
but just looking at where the true
dependencies are and completely ignoring
the anti anti and output dependences why
well because the renaming would
eliminate them anyway all that would be
left is the true dependencies so you
actually when you're computing the ILP
don't really need to look at a rename
program you can do it directly on the
program as it was written you just need
to follow only the true dependencies and
completely ignore the the anti and
output dependences second you know when
checking this off be mindful to kind of
remember how many cycles you are
computing and also what has been done
and so on and then you know just be
careful also to kind of divide the right
thing with the right things so it's five
instructions over two cycles not yet
way around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
