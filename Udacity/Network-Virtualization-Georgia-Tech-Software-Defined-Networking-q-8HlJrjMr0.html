of congestion increases in a quadratic
like manner as the loads on the links
continue in to increase ultimately
becoming increasingly expensive as link
utilization approaches one solving the
optimization problem however is much
easier if we use a piecewise linear cost
function we can define utilization as
the amount of traffic on the link
divided by the capacity and our
objective might be to minimize the sum
of this piecewise linear cost function
over all the links in the network
unfortunately solving this optimization
is still np-complete which means that
there's no efficient algorithm to find
the optimal setting of link weights even
for simple objective functions the
implications of this are that we have to
resort to searching through a large comp
set of combinations of link weight
settings to ultimately find a good
setting so clearly searching through all
the link weights is suboptimal but the
graphs turn out to be small enough in
practice such that this approach is
still reasonably effective in practice
we also have other operational realities
to worry about
for example minimizing the number of
changes to the network often changing
just one or two link weights is enough
to achieve a good traffic load balance
solution whatever solution we come up
with must be resistant to failure and it
should be robust to measurement noise we
also want to limit the frequency of
changes that we make to the network this
completes our overview of intradomain
routing and now we will take a look at
inter domain routing intradomain routing
and traffic engineering concerns traffic
flow within a single domain such as an
isp a campus network or a data center in
contrast inter domain routing and
intradomain traffic engineering concerns
routing that occurs between domains
something that we looked at before in
the context of the border gateway
protocol</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
