processing of video and some of the
applications or not just applications
but the general computations that we
would want to do and then we care about
how motion can be used in order to or
the motion processing abused to do that
so a simple one is background
subtraction so you might have a
situation where you've got a static
camera and a the background is
considered to be a static background and
I've got some object moving in the
foreground and my goal is to pull out
the foreground object the moving thing
from the static background so I might be
able to track it or model its dynamics
or recognize it or something else that's
that's focused on the object another
interesting application might be what we
call shot detection and that's
illustrated here so the idea is here we
have a bunch of frames that are in a
video and commercially produced video is
usually made up of a sequence of shots
each shot coming from a particular
camera the camera might be moving it
might be panning it might be dollying
moving at translating and then you'll
cut to a different shot and in this
particular case our shot boundary is
shown right here right all of these are
taken from one camera shot and these are
taken from another often it looks to you
like they're taking one right after
another but in reality they changed
everything they moved the camera around
change the actor read that his makeup he
went and got a smoke or whatever is
there smoking on set and then they came
back and they did the next shot and they
just cut them together and if you think
about what that would look like to a
computer in one case I might have a nice
smooth background moving with some
objects moving within it and then
there's this rapid change and I might
have another camera which might not be
static it might be moving as well and
the analysis of that motion might allow
you to do the shot detection so we have
background subject subtraction we have
shot boundary detection maybe we have a
bunch of objects that are moving in
different ways within a scene and we'd
like to separate out each of those
objects and that's referred to as motion
segmentation motion segmentation is you
segment the video into multiple what we
call coherently moving objects
it's alright so they're each moving but
they're moving in an independent way so
here's an example and what's funny is
this is a static image of a snake and a
mongoose taken off the web and you could
imagine trying to separate these out
just spatially in fact you can sort of
do that but in fact the color of the
Mongoose and the snake is very similar
to the color of the background and if
you were to track these things you would
see pixels coming and going but if you
actually look at the motion you would
see the motion of the snake as being a
coherent thing and the motion of the
mongooses being a coherent thing and you
would have be able to use motion to help
you segment out those objects</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
