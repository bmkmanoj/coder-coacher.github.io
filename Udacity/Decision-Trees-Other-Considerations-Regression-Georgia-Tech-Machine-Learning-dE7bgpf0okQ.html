to think about with decision trees but
you're not going to go into a lot of
detail but I think might be worth at
least mentioning is the problem of
regression so so far we've only been
doing classification where the outputs
are discrete but what if we were trying
to solve something that looked more like
x squared or 2x plus 17 or some other
continuous function in other words a
regression problem how would we have to
adapt decision trees to do that
any ideas Michael so this year now
continuous outputs not just continuous
inputs
all right maybe the outputs are all
continuous maybe the outputs are
discrete maybe they're a mix of both
well it certainly seems like our rule of
using information gain is going to run
into trouble because it's not really
clear how you measure information on
these continuous values so I guess you
could measure error some other way well
we're not something it's not error rate
it's trying to measure how how mixed up
things are oh so maybe something like
variance because in a continuous space
you can talk about you know if there's a
big spread of the values that that would
be measured by the variance oh good so
what you really have here now is a
question about splitting what's the
splitting criteria
I guess there's also an issue of what
you do in the leaves right so what might
you're doing to leave I guess you could
do some sort of more standard kind of
fitting algorithm so like report the
average or do some kind of linear fit
there's any number of things you could
here by the way that's worth pointing
out on the output that if we do pruning
like we did before we have errors we did
actually say when we talked about that
how you would report an output right if
you don't have a clear answer where
everything is labeled true everything is
labeled false how do you pick so
something like an average would work
there I don't know I mean it seems like
it depends on what we're trying to
measure with the tree if the tree is
we're trying to get as many right
answers as we can then you probably want
to do like a vote in the leaves right
which at least if the only answer is
true or false that would look a lot like
an average okay right so you pick you do
a vote I like that so we do vote so we
do pruning we do have to do with this
issue of the out
it somehow and something like a vote
makes sense
and here when you have a regression then
I guess average is a lot like voting
yeah in a continuous space yeah so
either way we're doing a kind of voting
I like that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
