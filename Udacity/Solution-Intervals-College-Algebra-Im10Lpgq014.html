solving rational inequalities and
quadratic ones for that matter so here
is my filled out table now I can just
read off which of these regions contains
X values that make this fraction or this
rational expression negative so that's
just this first region which is X is
less than two in the second region x is
greater than three since on a number
line these two regions do not overlap we
have to use an or since no value of x
can fall inside both regions so our
solution is x is less than 2 or x is
greater than three let's take a second
to think about how we could visualize
this inequality using graphs so here
I've plotted two equations I plotted y
equals negative 16x plus 48 over the
quantity 3x minus 6 and the purple line
is just a line y equals 0 the x-axis we
want to know according to our inequality
when this line the pink one lies
underneath the purple one and watch know
when the Y values of this curve drop
below this curve so we can see that
that's every part that's going to happen
for all X values except for those in the
very small portion of the curve that's
up here we can see that this match is
the solution we came up with this curve
lies below this one anywhere beyond this
point or x is equal to 3 and anywhere in
this part of the graph this line right
here that represents the disconnect
between these two portions of the pink
graph goes straight through the point 20
and in fact this is the line x equals 2
we can see that the entire part of the
pink graph that's to the left of this or
that has X values less than 2 is
underneath the purple curve so this fits
what we found awesome</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
