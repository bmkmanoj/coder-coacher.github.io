quiz let's go through this as as one by
one first every infection can be traced
back to defect that causes it this is
actually correct because if we have an
infection if we have an error in the
program state that is we can figure find
out which defect causes it namely the
piece ending the program which got a
same state as input and which produced
an erroneous state and infection as
output second every execution of a
defect causes an infection that's
actually not the case it may well be
that there is a defect in the code which
operates only under certain
circumstances which works fine most of
the time and only under certain
circumstances produces an infection so
this is not correct every infection ends
in a failure if only it were so then it
would be far easier to make a program's
defect free no like real infections they
can die out before they ever ever cause
real harm finally every defect can cause
a failure ha that's tricky remember a
defect is an error in the code failure
is an error in the execution an
infection and error in the state a
defect is an error in the code and you
can have an error in the code even in
code that's never executed or in code
that's actually unreachable how can it
be an error if it can never be executed
well it may well be that over time when
the program is maintained the error
actually becomes executable get then it
can actually cause a failure it is not
the case that every defect always can
cause a failure because defects may be
an unreachable code and therefore they
may not cause a failure so this is not
correct just as well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
