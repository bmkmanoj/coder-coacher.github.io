I think when you're working on a
workstation and your screen is vertical
then I think of it as Y up but people
working with pads now you sort of had to
have this place where the Z is coming
out of your pad your your tablet because
you're working in this direction I would
say negative Y because that's how my old
VGA card on my PC worked they for some
reason the y axis points downwards on
them so when you started making the
first 3d effects which was like you know
the star scroller you're like you're
flying toward in some kind of galaxy
which stars you ended up with you know
when you increased Y the point we're
moving downwards so I would say negative
Y that's up for me because I'm going to
shop all the time Z is always up and
that has to do a lot with like CNC
machining and you know with them on the
shopbot it's always the Z if you're
doing 3d printing it's always the Z
