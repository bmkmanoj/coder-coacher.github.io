different kinds of deoxynucleotides in
DNA and each one varies in this region
here
these colored variable regions are what
we call the nitrogenous base it's called
a nitrogenous base because it contains
an element from the periodic table
called nitrogen that's what the N
represents right here in each of these
structures the reason there are four
different types of deoxynucleotides is
because there are four different types
of nitrogenous bases the four different
chemical structures four nitrogenous
bases in DNA are adenine thymine guanine
and cytosine sometimes we note the names
of these nitrogenous bases or bases in
shorthand by using one letter
abbreviations a for adenine tea for
thymine G for guanine and C for cytosine
now if we go back up to our strand of
DNA and we replace the nitrogenous base
the chemical structure with the letter
that represents each base we get a very
different looking model that's much
easier for your eyes to distinguish
which type of deoxynucleotide is in each
position of the DNA so now take this new
single strand of DNA that has a
different sequence or order of
deoxynucleotides
see if you can look at this chemical
structure of the nitrogenous bases in
the single strand of DNA and write the
order of the bases in this text box here
obviously you can use the key here at
the bottom of the screen to see which
chemical structure corresponds with
which letter when you think you know the
right answer go ahead and put the
sequence of letters here in the textbox
all together with no spaces in between
the letters</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
