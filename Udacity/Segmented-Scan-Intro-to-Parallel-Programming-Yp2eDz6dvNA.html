the need for many small scans instead of
one large scan we've said before that
when you launch a kernel on a GPU you
want to have lots of work to do in that
kernel so it doesn't make a lot of sense
to launch a scan kernel separately on
each one of these small scans instead
we're going to pack these scans together
as segments inside one big array and
then have a special scan operator that
scans each of the segments independently
typically to indicate where segments
begin in an array we use a second array
that has ones for segment heads and
zeros for non segment heads let's do an
example so if you'll recall exclusive
sum scan on an array simply takes the
running sum of all elements that come
before the current element so the sum of
all elements before 8 for instance is 28
now
what's different about a segmented scan
is that we have a normal array what we
do is we're marking with these large
lines here boundaries between these
segments so when we call a segmented
exclusive sum scan on this array what
it's going to do is take separate scans
of each of these three segments so the
result is the scan of one two the scan
of three four five and the scan of six
seven eight and so the way that we're
going to represent these segments is
with segment heads so that we have a
second array the same length as the
input array that marks where segments
begin so a segment begins here with the
number one a segment begins with the
number three and the segment begins with
the number six so to make sure we're on
the same page we're going to take the
same array we did last time where we
computed an exclusive segment at some
scan and instead you're going to fill in
the result of an inclusive segmented sum
scan on this input array if you'll
recall an inclusive sum scan is going to
be the sum of all elements that came
before in the segment as well as the
current element so why don't you fill in
these eight boxes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
