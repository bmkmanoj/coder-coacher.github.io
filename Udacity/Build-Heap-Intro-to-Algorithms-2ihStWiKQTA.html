can actually use these pieces to build a
heap from scratch so we've got see a set
of we have the heap structure in this
case with seven nodes and we filled it
in with just random two-digit numbers
and it's not a heap at the moment but we
can make the heap property be satisfied
and this is the way we're going to do it
we're going to start off at the root
which is node zero and we're going to
say okay well to make this into a heap
well first magically make this into a
heap and make this into a heap and once
we're done then we can do down heapify
on this value and everything will be
fine all right but how do we build a
heap out of this smaller piece well we
can do it again recursively we can say
to build a heap rooted at this node make
this new heap make this into a heap and
then down heapify well how do we do
these guys well the singleton nodes are
already heaps so any leap anything that
is a leaf already we're done that's our
termination condition so this is a heap
and I'll check them off as we go this is
a heap this is a heap this is a heap
this is a heap all right so now to make
this whole thing a heap we need to do
our little swap thing so 88 gets swapped
this is down heapify 88 gets swapped
with 30 because 30 is the smaller of the
children and now that down heapify is
completed this whole thing is a heap we
need to do this subtree again same trick
these guys are already heaps to make
this into a heap we have to swap it with
the smaller of the children 13 now down
heapify finished so this is a heap and
now we've got just the last little step
to make the whole structure here into a
heap we need to do hit down heapify on
that on the root node which means
swapping it with the smallest of the
children that's the 13 and continuing
recursively because that's what down
heapify does swapping it with the
smallest until we reach the bottom and
that's done so the whole thing is a heap
we made it blue perhaps even cooler the
running time is is quite nice the time
it takes to build a heap out of n
elements
well we build two heaps of size n over
two then there's a log and step two down
heapify and this is a slightly hard
piece to analyze it's not so hard to
figure out that we're
essentially running down heapify which
is a login operation on each of the
nodes sort of as a root so we know that
it's actually Big O of n log n and
there's a tighter analysis which I'm not
going to give that actually shows that
this T of n is in big theta of n so we
can actually establish the heap property
throughout a tree of n nodes in linear
time that's pretty cool</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
