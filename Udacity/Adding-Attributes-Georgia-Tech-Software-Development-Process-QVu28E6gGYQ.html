and it's something that I can see here
that we didn't point out before is that
there seems to be clearly some concept
of the due date and I'm telling you why
I'm saying that because here for example
I notice that it says when items are due
we mention overdue several times so is
this something that we need to keep
track of yeah remember when we used to
stamp them on the books in the state
yeah yeah right yeah we definitely keep
track of the system has to keep track of
when books are there okay so and it
seems to me that one good way of doing
that is by basically adding an attribute
to the item okay and I'll just call it
due date okay so basically for each item
in case it no it's loaned there will be
this attribute will contain the value of
when when the item is due okay right and
then something else that I notice here
is that down here it seems like the
requirements are saying that an item can
be renewed only once so I guess that's
something else that we need to keep
track of right the system needs to know
we have to have to know whether they
renewed it or okay so I'll do a similar
thing here I think I want to go and add
an attribute that we call number of
times renew it and add it to the item
class okay and this is kind of more
generic than what you need because here
you say only ones but let's say that in
the future you weren't allowed to can
renew twice you'll be able to use this
attribute again because you know we can
just count how many times it was renew
it okay make sense all right and one
last thing I want to point out is it
seems pretty obvious but I'm gonna check
with you anyways and seems like there is
basically the need to keep track of
whether an item is checked out or not if
you if you look at the text here the
requirements here I can see that check
out and checked out are mentioned five
times so I'm assuming that that's
something also that we want to know
about an item whether it's checked out
or not we have to we have to keep track
of whether they're checked out okay so
I'll add an additional attribute there
so I'm gonna again go back to the to the
diagram and I'm just gonna right here
also the checked out attribute
and I think that's it as far as I'm
concerned is anything that you think is
missing well I I do have a do have a
question would checked out I it better
not be the case that somebody can check
out a reference book oh I see I see
yeah I mean oh oh it's only the books in
the audiovisual material that can be
checked out right right right
okay so I I guess well the way I will
fix that is I'll probably put yet
another attribute in the item class and
I'll call it loanable and basically this
attribute is just telling us whether an
item is loanable or not so when it's not
true when loanable is not you know on
basically that that item can be checked
out okay the system would know this this
is know the system will know that and
affirm you check the Randi from
happening okay all right perfect
so we're gonna do that and I need any
other objection any other any other now
that is my question okay perfect
so what I'm gonna do next to me I
haven't mentioned that yet but no
classes right now we just looked at the
attributes right they give you sort of
the state of the class and there's
something else this is the second part
of the class or a kind of orthogonal
aspect which is what the class can do
and we call those operations so normally
these classes also have operations I
guess you know makes sense to you as
well and one way one very natural way to
identify operations is to look at the
requirements and look for verbs because
verbs associated with an item will tell
you basically what the item can do okay
so I like to go back to the requirements
and start the same way in which we
underlined announce we're gonna
underline verbs and we're gonna see
which one's of those verbs actually
represent actions that we want to
represent explicitly we want to model
explicitly in our class diagram okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
