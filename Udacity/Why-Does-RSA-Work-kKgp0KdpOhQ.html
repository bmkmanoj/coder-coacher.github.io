know that the public key is enn and
private key is DN we also know that n
equals to P times Q and P and Q are
prime numbers therefore toshin n is P
minus 1 times Q minus 1 the public key e
in poverty D a multiplicative inverse of
each other
Matt ocean n that's why we say the
public key and a private key are paired
together and therefore when we compute X
raised to the power of e times T the
same as X raised to the power of E times
T Matt ocean n which happens to be one
that is let me compute X raised to a
power of e times T is same as X mod n so
that is the so quick recap of the
properties of the RSA public and private
keys now to include a message M mu raise
em to power of e mod n to decrypt we
take a ciphertext raise it to the power
of T mod n this is same as raising M to
the power of E times t mod n which is
the same as M mod n according to this
property since we require that the
plaintext input is smaller than the key
that means M mod n equal to M and that's
the original plaintext so this shows
that decryption indeed works as an
exercise you can similarly verify that
digital signature under RSA also works
here's an example of RSA the keys are
generated as follows we select two prime
numbers P equals 17 Q equal to 11 so n
is P times Q which is 187 and at ocean n
is P minus 1 times Q minus 1 because P
and Q are prime numbers so in this case
ocean 187 is 16 times 10 which is 160
for public key we select a number that's
relatively prime to toshin n in this
case we select 7 because 7 is relatively
prime to 160
the private key D is the multiplicative
inverse of e-mart ocean n so the
multiplicative inverse of 7 mod 160 is
23 therefore the public key is 23 to
summarize the key generation process we
at the public key 7 187 private key 23
187 suppose we use the public key to
encrypt the plaintext message 88 we
raised a DA to a power of 7 mod 187 the
result is 11 to decrypt we raised 11 to
power of 23 and then mod 187 the result
is 88 the same as the plaintext</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
