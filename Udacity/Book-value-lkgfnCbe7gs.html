the lesson we talked about three major
ways to estimate value one is intrinsic
value which we just covered
another is Book value which we're going
to cover now and the other is market
capitalization so let's take a look at
Book value here's a classic definition
of Book value it's total assets of the
company in other words things like
property that is owned and so on -
intangible assets and liabilities so
intangible assets are things that are
difficult to put a price on they're
things like the value of a brand or a
patent or so on liabilities are a little
bit easier to calculate those are just
things like loans that are owed and so
on so let's consider what is the book
value for an example company let's say
the company owns four factories and that
each of these factories is worth about
ten million dollars these are assets and
altogether they're worth about forty
million dollars suppose this company
also holds three very important patents
and each patent is valued at about five
million dollars the value of these
patents is about fifteen million dollars
but these are intangible assets that are
hard to price exactly finally suppose
this company has one large loan this
would be under the liabilities column of
ten million dollars if we follow this
rule that book value is total assets so
total assets are this 40 million plus
the 15 million or 55 million minus
intangible assets so we just don't count
these intangible assets and liabilities
it's all together we've got our total
assets minus intangible assets which is
40 million and liabilities minus this 10
million so in this case this company's
Book value is 30 million</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
