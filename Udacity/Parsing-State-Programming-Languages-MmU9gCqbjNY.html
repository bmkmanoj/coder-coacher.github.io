little more of the input let's say we
actually walk over and we see the two
well then our parsing state looks like
this e goes to two we've seen the two
and there's nothing left everything
important is in the past there's nothing
in the future so conceptually we can use
this rule this rewrite rule egos to two
like we hinted at here with their purple
text and we will also be here he goes to
e plus e but we've already seen the e
the plus + e e plus e so we can go even
further and go back to the first rule in
our grammar where we were trying to
parse a sentence which could be an
expression we've already seen an entire
expression 1 plus 2 and now we're done
and in fact if you can get to the state
corresponding to your starting
non-terminal being completely finished
everything is in the past nothing to see
in the future then you've parsed it that
string was in the language of the
grammar so formally a parsing state a
possible configuration of a parser a
world we could be in is a rewrite rule
from the grammar augmented with exactly
one red dot that's where I'm putting my
finger that's where we are now the past
comes before it the future comes after
it on the right hand side of the rule
you never put the dot on the left the
dot is always to the right now for any
given input as we've seen here you could
actually be in maybe three of these
parsing states at once one way of
looking at the world is that I just
finished seeing the two another way of
looking at the world is actually I'm
done with everything those can all be
true at the same time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
