where he talks about computers as
bicycles for the mind he said that back
in 1990 today we have about a hundred
thousand times as much computing power
as people had back then so we should
really think about computers as the
interstellar spaceships for the mind
this is pretty amazing you have in your
pocket more computing power than the
most powerful governments in the world
had access to 20 years ago but what's
really great about computing is
computers are universal machines this
means you can program them to do just
about anything well do this by looking
at something most people use every day a
web search engine you're not expected to
have any previous programming experience
entering the class but by the end of the
class you'll understand the big ideas
that power a search engine as well as
how to read and write your own computer
programs I hope you'll join us and enjoy
the ride</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
