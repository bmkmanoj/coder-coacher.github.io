is what's the probability of getting the
observation sequence given lambda given
an hmm and so first I want to look at a
naive solution and then you'll see how
the cool solution is so much better than
the naive solution so let's start off by
pretending assume for the moment we
actually know the sequence of States
okay so that's Q sub 1 through Q sub
capti I q sub 1 through Q sub capti
that's the actual state at time 1
through time Kathy H one of them is an S
sub J right so maybe it goes from state
3 to 2 to 4 or whatever 1 through T is
the time okay so we're gonna assume that
the other thing we're going to assume is
that the observations only depend upon
the state that you're in so when we say
independent observations what we mean is
that if you knew this state then the
probability of the observation is just
dependent on the state and not dependent
upon anything else well if that's the
case then the probability of the
particular observation sequence given
the state sequence
well because of independence it's just
the probability multiplied time each
other of the output of that of the
particular symbol seen at time T given
that you're in the particular state at
time T and that taken the whole product
and that's just these B variables right
so B of Q 1 that of o 1 means the
probability given that I'm in Q 1
whatever Q 1 happens to be of outputting
a 1 and etc ok so if we knew the state
sequence then we could just multiply
this to get the observation of the C the
likelihood of the observation sequence
given the state sequence but for any
given state sequence I can tell you the
probability of getting that state
sequence right it's just a very simple
product shown here right so if I know
it's Q 1 through qk t then it's the
probability here's PI of Q 1 of starting
in that state and then a of Q 1 Q 2 is
the probability of going from that state
Q 1 to whatever the next state Q 2 is
times a Q 2 Q 3 all the way up to
a cutie - one - cutie all right
so assuming I knew the sequence I could
tell you the probability well you say in
that case I can do the following given
that I can compute the probability of a
sequence of an observation sequence
given a state sequence and given that I
can compute the probability of any given
state sequence well then obviously we
can compute the probability of getting
that output sequence by just summing
over all the different state sequences
right taking the probability of the
state sequence times probability of the
observation given the state sequence
summed as I said overall the state
sequences okay
you could just do that of course the
problem with doing that is it would take
you a long time how long a really really
really long time and the reason is this
is summed over all possible paths all
possible state sequences all right well
there are n states and there are T time
steps that's end to the T okay
exponential and time into the T and each
one costs T calculations because I have
to figure out the probability of oh so
the complexity of that is T times n to
the T that as we say is a really long
time so it's not such a good solution so
you think we can do something better
well of course we could or I wouldn't be
standing here wasting your time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
