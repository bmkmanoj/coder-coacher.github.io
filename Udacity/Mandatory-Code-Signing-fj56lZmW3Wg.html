controls which user processes and apps
can be run to ensure that our apps come
from unknown or approved sauce and have
not been tampered with iOS requires that
all executable code be signed using an
Apple issued certificate more
specifically apps provided with the
device such as Mel or Safari are already
signed by Apple the party apps must also
be validated and signed using an Apple
issued certificate this military
co-signing extends the concept of chain
of trust from the iOS to the apps and
prevents third-party apps from loading
unsigned code or using self-modifying
code at runtime code signature checks of
all executable memory pages are being
performed as the pages are loaded to
ensure that our apps has not been
modified since it was installed or last
updated this is done through a user
space diamond and is enforced by the
kernel in summary iOS enforces military
co-signing and verification to extend
the chain of chest from iOS to the apps</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
