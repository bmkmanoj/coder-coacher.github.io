procedural design versus an object based
design you're all familiar I'm sure with
procedural design where you're writing
your code as one monolithic entity and
in a procedural world you have shared
state in terms of global variables and
you may have private state in the caller
and the callee
and state is now distributed all over
the place so basically the interface
between the caller and the callee is
through this normal procedure called
mechanism that one subsystem may make a
procedure call that goes into another
subsystem and this is how monolithic
kernels are built where state is now
strewn all over the place there may be
some shared state and private state of
subsystems and so on and this is
typically how monolithic systems are
built to contrast this procedural design
the object based design in an object
based design objects contain the state
that is entirely contained within this
object not visible outside and there are
methods that are inside this object that
manipulate the state that is part of
this object so in other words externally
the state is not visible the only thing
that is visible are the methods for
invocation and these invocations work on
the state that is local to the object so
what you get with an object based design
is strong interfaces and complete
isolation of the state of an object from
everything else contrast that with the
procedural design where the state can be
strewn all over the place and the shared
state can be manipulated from several
different subsystems that are part of a
big monolith but in this case what we
have is strong interfaces that
completely separate one object from
other objects and the state that is
specific to an object is contained
entirely inside this object invisible to
other objects outside except via
well-defined invocation methods that are
being exposed by this object implementer
to the outside world as always designers
the immediate question that might come
up is well if we have the strong
interfaces it sounds similar to what we
discussed when we talked about the
structure of operating systems early on
and that is border crossing across
protection domains is it going to cost
us but there are ways around it to make
these border crossing performance
conscious as well now where to apply
this object-orientation well in spring
for instance they applied object
orientation in building the operating
system kernel so the key point to take
away is if object orientation is good at
the level of implementing a
high-performance operating system kernel
it should be good at higher levels of
the software as well and while I am
expounding the virtues of object based
design here we've already seen this when
we talked about Tornado system that was
also using an object based approach to
building operating system kernels</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
