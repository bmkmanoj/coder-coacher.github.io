is actually quite simple
rice theorem simply says that if you ask
for an algorithm to decide if a program
has a functional property and it can be
any functional property then you're
looking at an undecidable problem I
don't even know if that comes as a
surprise to you after we have shown that
basically anything is undecidable it's
almost a surprise now that any problem
on a computer should even be solvable
but we'll get into that in a minute the
main question is of course how can you
show rice theorem and the proof of that
is actually quite easy and it follows
the same scheme as above here so the
proof of this general statement follows
the same scheme that all of our other
proofs of undecidability have basically
used so again we assume that there's a
program that can decide for another
program if that possesses a certain
functional property so we're given a
program P again any program P and we
assume that no matter what P is we can
always say does P have ID functional
property now on the other side assume
that there's another program P Prime and
what we want to do is solve the halting
problem for this program here and then
we'll use the algorithm here that can
decide for any program P if it has a
functional property to solve the halting
problem and the way we do this is as
follows we construct a new program will
call program X and this program has only
three steps first
it runs P prime then it clears all of
the memory so basically a fresh start
for the machine and this is the only
reason why we need this condition to
here for a functional property because
if we have an algorithm that can decide
a functional property this means that
there are some programs that have this
property and others that don't so we
will now add to our program X a program
that has this functional property so run
program with functional property and
what we then do is we take this program
X and feed it into this algorithm here
what you can see now is the following if
P prime here the problem for which we
want to solve the halting problem run
smoothly and terminates then this
program X will have the functional
property that we can decide because it
runs this algorithm here then it clears
the memory and then it runs a program
with that functional property this is
also the reason why time is not a
function
property that would kind of destroy the
proof of Rice theorem but if time is not
an issue then as long as P prime
finishes the program X will have the
functional property that we can decide
here if on the other hand P prime goes
into an infinite loop then the program
does not have the functional property
because it will never be able to reach
these two lines here so deciding the
functional property for this new program
X here is the same as solving the
halting problem for the original program
that we started out with</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
