you get me my genome oh you got your
genomes information back what do you
think oh I love it it's really exciting
I found out a lot about my traits
including some diseases that I'm not a
carrier for which is great news as well
as my risk factor for her some complex
traits well it's kind of like a big
story book of you isn't it it is except
there's something missing that I kind of
wanted to know about what's up I wanted
to know like where I fit in and the
grand scheme of things well Lauren when
when two people love each other very
much Matt Matt I know where I came from
in that way oh I've had that talk before
I'm talking about like 10,000 years of
ancestry I want to know where I came
from like that well it is true your
genome can really reveal that
information giving you close family
members even answers into your deep
distant past all you need to know is
where to look what where are we yeah
this is the genome library and all of
these books represent the genomes of
thousands of people all across the world
and using this information we can make
comparisons and possibly find family
relationships that you never even knew
about before well I mean I know I have a
brother and I have a half-brother I
parents well sure you know these
relationships but your genome has a lot
of secrets to it and it could possibly
reveal that some of the relationships
you think or true may not be as true as
you think and it could reveal new
relationships you never even knew about
before and don't forget there are
adopted individuals who've never even
had an opportunity to know who their
blood relatives are so this could be a
great opportunity for them well they're
really fortunate to have this tool I
think this is an awesome opportunity for
anybody but I am still interested in
knowing where I fit in the grand scheme
of things well you're in luck larne
because with this genomic information we
can get pretty far in answering that
question</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
