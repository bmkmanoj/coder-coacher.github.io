difficulty in must somehow incorporate
these two concepts of total amount or
weight of water and the distance we have
to lift it and so why don't we start by
thinking about the last unit well in the
last unit we learn about force and
namely forces the cause of acceleration
and we use this equation to describe
acceleration well let's try to analyze
the situation using forces well I have
all this water here that I need to get
rid of that I need to pump up this water
has some mess which means I can draw it
as a force diagram and to make things
simple of represented the water is a
simple block of mass M that block has a
weight and the ground is supplying some
normal force to keep the water up well
using forces to analyze this situation
well it seems like total weight of water
is taken care of we've addressed that
concept but we haven't talked about the
distance we have to lift this water
which also seems very important
analyzing or quantifying this difficulty
of this task how much work we're going
to have to do I've been using this word
work kind of colloquially but it has a
very precise meaning in physics and
that's one we're going to learn today
we're also going to learn about energy
and what's called the conservation of
energy so even though these terms work
in energy are relatively new ones we can
go all the way back to the time of
Archimedes to study their origins</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
