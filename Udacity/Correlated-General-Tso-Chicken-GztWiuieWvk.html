actually going to be even better than
dying 1/9 of the time what we're gonna
do is we're going to introduce a third
party so you know here's smooth mmm and
here's curly yeah and then here's my
best sort of drawing of Chris who's
helping us with this Clower course
creator course creator commissary
I like course creator better because
then it's like a good MC name though of
course developers CD which is on the
screen that's true of course developer
Chris good will do that it does sound
like a good hip-hop name there you know
we should do we should do some kind of
rap of some sort you're gonna have to
teach me because I don't know how to do
that
okay well we'll talk about it later okay
so we're gonna put our little CD here
and he is going to stand between us so
he's gonna act as a kind of go-between
and what he's gonna do is he's gonna
make a decision for us of a certain sort
so here's the decision that we're gonna
have Chris - Chris is going to write
down three cards one's gonna say CC
one's gonna say DC and one's gonna say
CD three cards three cards okay yeah and
he's going to shuffle those cards and
then pick one of them so in other words
he is going to uniformly randomly choose
among C comma C D comma C and C comma D
okay yeah yeah okay I get it so you'll
notice that that's three of the four
strategies it's three of the four
strategies yeah you're missing D D D D
which is the worst one yeah so you
should put down it no okay well I could
put it in and give it an assignment a
probability of zero but I like that
you're their cards and we they all have
equal probabilities right they're all
have equal probability so uniform choice
all right so you with me okay so Chris
randomly picks one of these three things
neither of us knows what it is and we
don't know anything about where the
other has but Chris gets to pick up this
car and then what Chris is gonna do is
something very simple chris is going to
inform one of us perhaps both of us one
after the other but Chris is going to
let's say for the purposes of this
discussion Chris is going to inform one
of us of what that person's action is
let's say Chris pick C comma C Chris
will turn to me and we'll say I want you
to choose C now Chris will could also
turn to you and say I want you to choose
C okay and there's no conflict there cuz
we can both chicken you both do whatever
you want to do I'm just telling you
here's what the card says you should do
all right card says you should chicken
out and he's going to force me to do
that now no let me do one more example
before I really answer that question all
right let's say Chris had accidentally
and that is uniformly probabilistically
I've chosen D comma C yes then Chris
would turn to me and say the card says
you should do D Chris would turn to you
and say the card says you should do C
but I would know that he was actually
just making me chickened out because
that's what people do
no that's because that's what the card
says now let me be a little bit clearer
here okay there wasn't these three cards
are known to both of us yep and we know
that there's a uniform probability of
giving any of those three cards and we
trust Chris enough that he's not gonna
always give you the good thing yes he's
going to with probability 1/3 okay do
that okay Jess Chris all right I trust
Chris I mean look at that hair I could
you not trust Chris okay so Chris is
gonna pick one of these cars and then
tell each of us what it is we're going
to do or what we're being asked to do
okay but not tell us what the other
person is being asked to do okay so
that's important got it yeah that's okay
because I can use inference you can use
inference so in fact let me ask you what
inference you should use so Bayesian
inference oh you didn't ask it I didn't
ask it so in fact I'm gonna because you
said Bayesian I didn't say Bayesian you
just said Bayesian inference I'm gonna
make this a quiz Oh
as punishment for saying beach how dare
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
