procedure we had before we're checking
if the name at position zero is equal to
D or the result of name at position zero
is equal to n that produces the same
result and we've introduced the new
construct or which gives us the logical
or of the two operands on its left and
right so just to see how or works we can
use or like this so if we have true or
false the value of true or false is true
if we have false or true that also has
the value true true or true is also true
but false or false is false and I'm
showing these with boolean literals this
could be any expression we want like we
use the name at position 0 here the one
important thing that or does that's
different from other operators it only
evaluates what it needs to so here's an
important example so we could say true
or this is an error' that will also
evaluate to true even though if i just
looked at this is an error by itself
well that's an undefined variable we
didn't define the variable this is an
error but when we evaluate the or
expression because we already found that
the first part was true
we don't get an error if we try to
evaluate instead of true or this is an
error if we evaluate false or this is an
error it's necessary to look at the
second operand and then we'll get an
error so let's try that we're doing
false or this is an error we get an
error because since the first operand
was false to know whether the or is true
or false we need to look at the second
operand and that's not defined this
behavior or will turn out to be very
useful we'll see other places where we
rely on the second operand not getting
evaluated if the first one is true so to
summarize here's what the or construct
looks like so if the first expression
evaluates to true then the value of the
or construct is true
and there's no need to evaluate the
second expression and in fact the Python
interpreter does not evaluate it if the
value of the first expression is false
then the value of the or construct is
the value of the second expression</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
