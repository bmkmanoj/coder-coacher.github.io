become really easy take our coin flip
there's a true probability P for the
coin now we know that we sample the coin
n times and compute from it our
empirical mean using the formula you
well know that it's well true they could
easily happen that P doesn't Inc from
you and it's because flipping the coin a
fine number of times gives us just an
estimate of the true probability P now
how likely are estimates so suppose this
is a true P and they give you three
possible news this one this one and one
out here and I put little check marks on
it underneath check the box that is the
most likely mu we might observe if P is
the true probability using our
statistical estimator and of course this
nearest one in fact the most likely one
will repeat itself and the further out
you are the less like needs to have a
sample that gets you this far out
and now we'll be using the central limit
theorem for large and say enlarged or
equal to 30 we know that the
distribution of Muse you might observe
is Gaussian for any value here let's
call this one a the chances that we
observe a mu that's smaller than a is
the same as the surface area under the
Gaussian over here
that's a tricky haven't seen but the
probability of driving any mu is at
least in the limit given by the height
of this Gaussian so for any value a we
can compute the probability that mu
becomes smaller than a and by symmetry
for any value B there is say equally
away from psas on the left side from P
you can do exactly the same thing now
where does the 1.96 come from and here's
the trick 1.96 marks the 95% confidence
interval so we plug in the observed mu
instead of the P which we don't know
under the central limit theorem we get
the same Gaussian and then we compute
the ex of which mu minus X mu plus X
give us these decision boundaries such
as the total area in these two tails
over here is exactly 0.05 that's the
same as 5% in fact we place half of this
on the left side and half of it on the
right side when that's the case the
converse interval itself carries 95% of
all possible values for P so the chances
that P lies outside the green converse
and Mo is 5% hence we call it a 95%
consequence though let me ask you a quiz
suppose you go from 95 percent to 90
percent
does this make X smaller larger or will
there be no change which one is it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
