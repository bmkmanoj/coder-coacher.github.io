about why we would use MongoDB one of
the most important reasons to use
MongoDB is because it has a flexible
schema this enables us to more easily
handle data in flat formats such as CSV
and also hierarchical data where
individual fields are composed of
multiple elements MongoDB is also
oriented toward programmers one way we
see this is that the type of JSON
documents stored in MongoDB map directly
on too familiar data types found in most
popular programming languages such as
the examples we saw PHP arrays Python
dictionaries etc another place we see
this is in the MongoDB client libraries
or drivers as we call them MongoDB
supports drivers for most popular
programming languages these drivers
handle the job of translating the data
to and from native data types within the
particular language as needed by the
application and also support a number of
other features that make it easy to
develop applications using MongoDB
another feature that makes Mountain
going to be great for data scientists is
your ability to deploy MongoDB in a
variety of ways so for example in just a
couple of minutes you can download
install and run MongoDB on your laptop
and quickly begin developing an
application on your laptop or you can
deploy MongoDB on multiple servers with
several demons running to support a big
data application and of course there are
lots of options in between these two
MongoDB is designed for big data it's
highly scalable horizontally on
commodity hardware and includes native
support for MapReduce and it includes
the aggregation framework that enables
efficient analytics applications okay so
enough chatter about MongoDB let's dive
in and actually start using it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
