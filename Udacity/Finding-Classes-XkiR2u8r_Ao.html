registration menu then click lookup
classes then we'll select our term this
will bring us to a list of every subject
offered across the entire university
right now the OMS program has classes in
two subjects computer science and
computational science and engineering so
we'll scroll down to those and use shift
to select both then we'll click course
search and we'll get a list of all the
courses in those subjects that are
offered in the semester you can then
click view sections to see the status of
the different sections of that class
we'll talk about this screen in a bit
you might notice that this list is
actually pretty overwhelming you're
seeing every class offered on campus for
the entire semester as well as the
online classes we can make this a bit
easier by going and doing an advanced
search like before we're going to select
computational science and engineering
and computer science as our subjects but
then we're going to scroll down to
campus and select online and then we'll
do our search then when I scroll down
i'll see only those courses offered in
the online campus or in the OMS program
for that semester this way you can focus
only on those classes for which you can
actually register so now let's talk
about actually registering</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
