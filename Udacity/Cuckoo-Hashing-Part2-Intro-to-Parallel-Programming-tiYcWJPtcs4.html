we're going to try to hash into this
giant cuckoo hash table and the cuckoo
hash table has two sub tables T 1 and T
2 and so each one of those 2 sub 2
tables has two slots corresponding to H
1 equals 0 H 1 equals 1 H 2 equals 0 H 2
equals 1 now we have four items that we
are going to try to hash into this big
cuckoo hash table and so I've already
computed their hash functions so item a
for instance it's H sub 1 of its
particular key is 1 and H sub 2 is equal
to 1 and so on so you can see all these
hash functions here so let's do round 1
what do we do on round 1 what we try to
do is place all of the alive items and
we start off with all the items being
alive and we're trying to get place them
all into T 1 using this hash function so
now we see that items a and C both would
like to map into this bucket and items B
and D because of their values of H 1
would like to map into this bucket now
we can only fit one item per bucket so
we're gonna arbitrarily pick a couple of
items to win
okay so I'll arbitrarily pick that C and
D happen to win here D is written into
hash bucket number 0 and C is written
into hash bucket number 1 cool and so a
and B are still alive and now we move to
the next iteration of the algorithm and
we use H sub 2 to try to map a and B
into Table 2 and we see well both of
these guys would like to map into this
same bucket so again they're both going
to try only one of them is going to
succeed for the purposes of argument I'm
gonna say that's gonna be beat ok so now
we still have element a left after both
browns so here's the neat part we now go
back to table 1 and we know that if we
hash item a it's going to collide with
an item already stored in the hash table
we know that because it didn't succeed
the first time so we're going to try to
hash it again but now when it collides
with an item that's already in the hash
table here's the different part we're
going to take a and place it into the
hash table and we're going to kick out
the item that's already there and
continue and now we continue on the next
iteration of the algorithm again we see
that the only item that's left alive is
now C we see that its value of H
is zero so we can safely place C into
the hash table here and we're done so
the big picture here is that by kicking
out things that are already in the hash
table we have a new set of items to try
to continue to place in the hash table
and maybe they'll fit better than the
old set and we continue to apply this
procedure on each iteration we always
try to place our outstanding items into
the next sub table of the hash table and
if they succeed they kick out the items
already there until we have no more
items left now will this always succeed
yes or no</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
