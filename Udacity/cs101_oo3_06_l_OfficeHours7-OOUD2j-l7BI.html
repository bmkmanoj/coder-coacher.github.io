hi hi can you try again we couldn't
quite hear
may want to try typing your question
ok
I you see that a life which of what kind
of masks are we talking about me talk to
her oh so what's what are the actual
what kind of mad zach are expected for
the cryptography also what kind of mass
is related to prepare science oh okay so
it's two different questions so so for
in general for computer science that
most of the math that we use is discrete
math and what discrete means is values
that are in a well-defined set so the
integers are discrete there's a finite
number that they're actually counters an
infinite number there's a countable
number as opposed to the real numbers
where there's an uncountable number of
real numbers and so discreet things or
things that are accountable you can
count how many there are the continuous
math like calculus comes up in some
areas of computer science but not nearly
as often to discrete math and the reason
the street math comes up is because in
computers we're representing things
using the digital abstraction so we're
representing things at the level in the
computer as zeros or ones where although
there's physical things that are analog
that are storing the values we're doing
all the processing on them as discrete
values so most of the math that is most
fundamental to computer science is this
great math so logic is a big part of
that now and you've been doing logic
you've been using if and predicate tests
you've really been doing logic there's a
lot of formalism behind the logic that
we haven't covered in cs101 and we will
have a discrete math course that will be
one of the courses that start in june
the other kinds of math that are
important so for cryptography we use
probably a bully of a lot so that's
probably the most important background
to have for the cryptography course I'll
teach number theory is used a lot in
photography so things like modular
arithmetic is used a lot and and that's
used in all of computing but becomes
especially important in cryptography and
what else one sebastian's classy is a
lot of linear algebra yes yeah linear
algebra definitely that sebastian class
robotics AI graphics all use linear
algebra a lot um cryptography does use
linear algebra
not the cryptography that I'm going to
focus on in the course that i'm going to
teach but there are parts of
cryptography that that are based heavily
on using lattices and that's it that's
all building on linear algebra yep
we did talk about homework 2.5 earlier
the cards commercial my shadow I think
when we post these guys wait I had more
questions about that yet but but I think
hopefully people saw the discussion
earlier yeah and we'll post it on the
website my numbers are immutable what
was it oh so there's like the question
where you assign X plus 1 to X Y is I
come what does that create a new number
and it's it's a good question to think
about so when we think about what
programs mean we have a model and that's
an abstract model of saying well we're
not modifying a number we're creating a
new number we're not actually creating
something new to build that number we
just need to store that number so often
the way we we think about programs
executing as a model doesn't correspond
very closely to actual resources that
are used to execute the program another
example in this depending on how far
you've seen the lectures that the range
that takes in two numbers we think of
that as producing a list between the two
numbers and that's what it does but when
it's used in a for loop the Python
interpreter is much smarter and doesn't
actually have to build that list that's
why it's faster to use the four with the
range then to use the while loop with
the adding adding one so these are
things where it's helpful to have a
simple model that shows how the program
executes and is correct in terms of the
semantics and the meaning of the program
in terms of what's actually implemented
there are lots of ways that things might
be implemented that don't actually
involve doing everything that our model
says
accessing the Python income okay so a
question is being able to access the
interpreter and lecture at any time and
the low expression not yes so we hope
the site will soon have a button that
makes it easy to pop up the interpreter
and try things on your own if there are
other ways to run Python and depending
on what kind of machine you have that
that could be quite easy if you have a
Mac if you open a Mac shell and type
Python you get a Python interpreter so
you can try things yourself that way if
you don't have a Mac you can go to
python org and download the Python
distribution and that includes a way to
run python that works on almost all
platforms so there are lots of ways to
run Python separately from the way we
run in the class we think having the
embedded interpreter that you can run
right in the browser is helpful and you
don't need to install any software to
the class and we hope to make it easier
to access that but for now it's only
when you have a quiz or homework problem
that uses it next question is am I your
students uh-uh is it do I answer that
idea I don't know well I'm not I'm not
here I'm not taking you destine course
right now that's that's true um I am a
student in Dave's a security research
group back at the University of Virginia
so Peter was was a TA for me Beckett at
the University of your unit and a
student in my research group has done a
lot of very exciting research on
security which is what my group does
work on and since he managed to finish
all those course requirements as
semester early I is able to come out
here to be a TA for this class which is
much more than a full-time job yes
that's true uh it well I guess still
sort of this low its but it's nine
o'clock and we're still here yes so it's
kind of a nine-to-five and it's applying
I do say like you know once the student
always a student so it's all about the
mind sighs we talked about the dusting
name earlier so I think we should take
one last question yeah wisin your last
question is the last question that
because my battery's about to die anyway
oh I've got one question go for it do
you plan on offering them like graduate
level classes or class that would
involve research and more interaction
with students so we definitely plan to
offer more advanced courses and the
course Sebastian is teaching now is a
fairly graduate level I think it's
definitely much beyond what most
undergraduate courses where the planned
courses that will have been doing are
probably so the 200 level courses and
then some more advanced undergrad
graduate level courses will definitely
have a mix of more introductory in more
advanced courses as we go forward a lot
of you know that the experience of doing
a PhD is really individual focused on a
research problem working very closely
with a professor for commerce and that's
something that sort of involves a lot of
you know one-on-one interaction and
working sort of to define a problem to
work on is very unique experience so
it's not something that you can scale or
offer without having many in person
meetings and that's really to do a PhD
is a very different kind of teaching
then classes would be but we think we
can definitely offer and do plan to
offer a high level graduate courses that
will probably be a little bit later
before we have have many graduate
courses but that we will have okay well
well thanks everyone for joining hang
out this was an experiment I think it
more or less where we had some glitches
getting started and and you know we
realized people are in different time
zones so if we do this again we'll
schedule at a time that's more
convenient for Africa and Europe and
we'll move the time around that to work
well for different students but thanks
everyone who joined us and thanks for
the questions and we'll post them on the
website yes so if you came in like okay
I will see them okay okay goodnight
thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
