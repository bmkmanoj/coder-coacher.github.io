down so I'm going to start with just
imagining printing the first row this
for loop might seem a little bit silly
but once I write it I can compare it to
the one for the second row for each
column I want to print out a pair of
square brackets but in this case the
columns start at the first column and
only go up to the first column so
that'll look like this the for loop for
the second row will look pretty similar
except it will print two pairs of
brackets one for column one one for
column two so this is interesting
instead of something changing inside the
loop it's the actual loop condition
itself that's changing from row to row
the threshold is actually the row itself
now these are exactly the same so I
could set row to one and do this and
then increment wrote a two and do the
exact same thing which means that I can
put this code into a loop so I'll indent
it remove the extra repetitions and now
instead of just setting row to one I'll
actually loop over all of the rows
starting at 1 and going while row is
less than or equal to the total number
of rows let's see how much progress
we've made after fixing typos well it's
certainly printing some brackets let's
put line breaks between the rows much
better this was kind of neat in this
problem we used the outer loop variable
to control the number of iterations in
the inner loop the loop condition for
the inner loop depends on the loop
counter variable for the outer loop</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
