we start off with some underlying
distribution pardon my inability to
trace okay but of course we don't
actually have a real distribution what
we have is a set of particles okay those
particles are not uniformly weighted
remember the sum of all the weights is
one some particles are more weight than
others that is they that particle has a
higher probability all right so here's
what we do the first thing we do is we
draw a set of samples from this set okay
now you'll notice here in this nice
picture one of my big particles happened
to gets to get sampled three times the
medium particles got sample twice and
that this one got sample ones and by the
way notice how many times did these
itty-bitty particles get sampled not at
all that's okay because you're doing a
random sample because it corresponds to
the density and that random sampling
sometimes gets all the particles
sometimes only gets the ones with
significant weights so we do the
sampling now the next thing you'll see
is that each one of these particles has
been shifted but you'll notice that the
shifts are not always the same so why do
you think that is do you know why that
is there's a deterministic part nothing
says that my deterministic part has to
be the same for all my guesses of the
previous state okay let's suppose what I
do is I take a step proportional to the
number of lines that are on the floor
right so I'm going to step three lines
but if the lines are closer here than
they were over here relax Megan then
going three step three lines over here
would actually mean I'd moved a smaller
amount than if I was over here if I gone
three lines I would have gone a further
amount all this means is that the
deterministic part doesn't have to be
the same everywhere it's just
deterministic then we add in essentially
what could be thought of as the
diffusion part of the uncertainty part
remember when we were generating the new
sample we did the deterministic part
plus the probabilistic part and that's
what's here right so after we take a
sample and we move it we add some noise
and we do
that every time we had drawn a sample so
since we drew three samples from this
particle it ended up at three different
places likewise for all the others then
what we do is we take our measurement
and we've got P of Z given X that's what
this value is and we just multiply these
weights which are all one to start with
by that value okay oh here it is P of Z
given X we just multiply it and we end
up with this new set of particles okay
so if i erase my my figures there you
take a look that's a beautiful figure
it's all of particle filtering just
sleep with it under your pillow and
you'll be in great shape</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
