customer development process ties back
into agile engineering and agile
development hand and glove basically
it's this notion of the Minimum Viable
Product back in the old days what we use
to do is specify the entire feature set
of the product from beginning to end now
this makes sense when you're in a large
company releasing version 2 o 3 o &amp;amp; 4 o
because you kind of have a feeling of
who the customers are and what they need
so a product manager can be pretty
accurate about you know I've been
interacting customers for the last year
and a half and I think I know what they
need but in a start-up you're really
kind of guessing and the odds are you're
going to be guessing wrong so rather
than waste a whole ton of time and money
why don't we actually get outside the
building before we build something and
waste a lot of engineering time and more
importantly cash because that's what
puts startups out of business is running
out of money we want to make sure that
we actually listen to the people who
eventually will buy this product we want
to make sure we satisfy their wants and
needs so why don't we just figure out
how to build the Minimum Viable Product
build the minimum features in order to
get feedback now feedback could take the
form of input and verbally or they gave
you early orders or they gave you
anything that was valuable in helping
you come to closure of what should we be
building in what order
and by the way MVP could be something as
simple on the web as a wireframe or a
PowerPoint slide or for physical product
it could be a physical mock-up or it
could be a working part of the system
but as you get more feedback you could
start adding more features so one caveat
is a comment I always get is well Steve
Jobs didn't build the iPhone by asking
customers and we really doubt Henry Ford
asked customers do they want a car
before one existed in fact in his case
if you would ask people about what they
wanted they would have set a faster
horse or one with six legs and so the
immediate response is well therefore for
new products you just don't get out of
the building at all and that's just a
fallacy there is a type of startup in
what we call a new market and we'll be
describing new markets in the customer
segments lecture but just understand
than in new markets of course you don't
get out and ask people what features
they need but you do want to understand
how is their day in the life different
today versus the day after you give them
your new product how does their world
change and there's no possible way
sitting locked in your conference room
or your office you would know that
without talking to customers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
