option for showing GPU overdraw once you
toggle that too active you'll notice
that your layouts are all drawn with a
tint a pixel drawn once is shown in its
normal color but when the pixel is drawn
over itself it's tinted you've got blue
41 overdraw green for two pink 43 and
red for four or more clearly the goal
here is to minimize the amount of red
and keep everything fairly blue to see
how this works will look at sunshine
both before and after dan updated it
with a look inspired by material design
you'll notice that most things are
pretty consistent except that after
material everything is a shade or two
darker on the 10th scale this is because
material design focuses on beautiful
components and transitions and so it
comes with a heavier drawing costs some
events have a heavier cost as well
clicking for example tends to result in
a shading effect as an indicator of the
action to the user you can see this with
the red / draw on a touch event with
material design though we increase the
number of these types of smaller / draws
with the addition of animations such as
the scroll animation or the hover action
in the menu these animation elements add
a bit of magic to the app and help
create a beautiful user experience but
as you've seen there's clearly a
rendering cost perf considerations are a
trade-off you want to do fancy things
but you might be doing too much so use
your tools to set up a regular testing
process and then evaluate while your
changes for the better versus how it
could be improved</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
