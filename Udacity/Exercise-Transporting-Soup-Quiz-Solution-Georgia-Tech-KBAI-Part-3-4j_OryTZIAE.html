the answer seems kind of obvious the
only thing among all these objects that
we transport soup would be the pitcher I
think most of us would give the same
answer the picture not the backpack of
the car or this box now for humans for
you and me this is a little early easy
problem all of us get it right pretty
much all the time but what about a
machine what about a robot how would a
robot decide that a picture is a good
utensil to use for transporting soup
from the kitchen to the dining table but
not a backpack or not a box for a robot
this is a surprisingly hard problem so
the question then becomes but what is it
that makes it easy for humans and hard
for robots how can we program air agents
so that it would be easy for them as
well one important thing to note here
this is another example of incremental
learning now we have come across
incremental learning earlier when we
were talking about incremental concept
learning there we were given one example
at a time that was the example of arch
and we were learning one concept of
concept of arch this is in contrast to
other methods of machine learning where
one is given a large amount of data and
one has to detect patterns of the galera
T in that data here there is learning
occurring one step at a time from a
small number for examples one single
concept is being learned we also came
across the notion of incremental
learning when we were talking about
chunking there to there was one
particular problem and from a small
number of previous episodes we chunked a
particular rule this notion of
incremental learning permeates much of
knowledge-based AI another thing to note
here this notion of explanation miss
learning is brilliantly do creativity we
talked earlier about the relationship
between creativity and novelty here is
an example in which an AI agent is
dealing with a novel situation usual
utensils work taking soup from the
kitchen to the dining table are not
available what should the robot do the
robot comes up with a creative solution
of taking the picture as the utensil</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
