about file formats we basically talked
about file formats being nothing else
but a data structure that would actually
store the intensities of each and every
pixel in an image but in some instances
some one might say that's a lot of
missing information why don't we get a
lot of information that's raw to the
sensor and actually just save that and
that's behind the whole concept of a
camera raw file format basically what
you do in a camera raw file format is
basically you store the minimally
processed data from each and every part
of the sensor each and every point
that's measured light you save the
original or as close to the original raw
data from there the images in a camera
RAW format are encoded in a device
dependent color space sometimes of
course is a proprietary color space but
each camera has a specific form of a
color space and it basically does as
image is stored in that and after you
save it the camera manufacturers do
provide information on how to take that
color space and make it much more
readable on a computer more importantly
it also captures the radiometric
characteristics of the scene radiometric
basically meaning that the light and the
intensities of the colors from the scene
are captured in a raw format rather than
manipulated in any way whatsoever many
of you who do advanced photography know
that in some cameras there's a lot of
calibration tools that allow you to
control the light and also the colors
very specific to the scene sometimes by
doing white balancing or different types
of color contrast and stuff like that
one of the beautiful things about Camera
Raw is since it's capturing the raw
radiometric characteristics of the scene
you can do all of that after the fact in
essence what it does is basically lets
you get the image from the camera's
sensor data so the whole concept of a
camera raw file format is its to kind of
replicate the whole photographic
negative one of the things that went
away when we started going from film to
digital images is while we have the
instant gratification of seeing the
image as soon it was captured
we basically got it processed it was not
something we couldn't manipulate anymore
one of the beautiful things about doing
a darkroom photography was always that
once the film was exposed when you were
sitting in a dark room you could do a
variety of different ways of exposing
that film and give you different
contrast levels well that now is
possible through the camera RAW format
because once you have the camera format
with things like the radiometric
characteristics and stuff like that you
could actually do a lot more so in
essence one of the advantages of a
camera or file format is that they're
minimally processed device dependent and
therefore actually you know you know
more about how the perfect response for
that specific camera's device is oh this
so it's device dependent basically the
color space is really known by the
manufacturers and therefore they allow
you to read out the best values from it
radio metrics all the color values are
well defined and captured raw and of
course this represents an equivalence
class to the forum photographic negative
lets you control things after the fact
and allows you to do things like changes
in dynamic range color and most of the
information the captured image is
available to you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
