going to be talking about stage 2 tips
and tricks and my name is Rahul am
Udacity coach I'm Anthony I'll see you
nessa p coach and yeah so today we want
to address some issues that you guys
might have been having with the code
your own quiz project and by the end
this webcast hopefully you'll have an
idea of not only to how to approach
programming problem this particular
ovarian problem posed by stage two but
also programming problems in general is
being able to identify the problem and
break it down yeah definitely so before
this webcast we looked into some of the
common reasons why students do not meet
specifications on the stage to project
and the top reasons were not commenting
at the beginning of functions not using
functions appropriately to repeat to
automate repeated tasks or having
functions that are longer than 18 lines
of code and there were some smaller
issues like prompting the users to try
again and printing the quiz after you've
replaced a blank but overall almost all
these problems that have one commonality
and that is that they all have to do
with properly defining functions and
because of that we're going to be
focusing almost entirely today on how to
read a problem break down the problem in
such a way that it makes it easy to
develop functions when the time comes
for it so one of the first places as one
of the one of the great way to start off
approaching this type of problem is you
go you've got this like much larger
problem right say the city to project
you have this huge problem that is
create a fill in the blanks quiz now
that's going to be involving a lot of
different tasks a lot of different steps
and really one of the first things you
want to do is not think about it
at that large-scale problem you want to
think about it as these individual tasks
and for that um you know we're not going
to kind of break down the whole problem
for you because that is your job is your
job that's why you're taking this course
but we're going to try to what we're
going to try to do is provide an ALICE
problem and kind of show you how we need
to go step by step to break down this
problem and most importantly how we
break down this problem can inform the
way that we code a solution to this
problem so today I'm going to share this
following problem with you it's a very
simple one but the idea is to just get
you thinking about how to abstract away
the big parts of what you're being asked
so let's open up sublime over here got a
screen share yeah I'm just tasting to
hear first step back one second promise
that I'm actually doing something and
let's just share sublime okay I said go
there yep okay so the problem that we're
going to be working on today is show a
user three different show you to three
different people drinking coke i I think
that's a sufficiently ambiguous problem
and some of you might be approaching the
stage to project as a sufficiently
ambiguous problem as well so for that
reason um let's just break down what it
is we're trying to talk about so what
does what a show mean here um well
because if sometimes like no one we can
ask to kind of clarify the certain parts
of a problem we sometimes have to make a
reasonable assumption about what's met
and try to move forward like that so
let's assume that in this case show
means print it may or may not mean it
but for our purposes in moving forward
we're going to say that show means
prints now the second part of this
problem is show user three different
people drinking coke what does that mean
well I think that here we can also make
another assumption that
show means printing so we might want to
print three different people because
we're not given the people like we're
told to print out we can assume that we
can just make them up so uh we can also
assume that drinking coke could also be
like just a word a string you know some
sentence that we print out so here uh
we've kind of broken down the problem
logically and and with that we've kind
of like talked out what it is we want to
say and this is kind of what we wanted
it to what we just went over we said
that we want to have three people we
want to print ready to be printed and
you want to take the first person print
the first person drinking code pick in
the second person print the second
person drinking coke and taking the
third person and prints that person
drinking coke as well seems kind of
silly but um what we've done here is
just really kind of broken down this
ambiguous question and given us given
ourselves in comments a direction to
actually go forward and code something
yeah and this is one of goes back to one
of the reasons why a lot of students
don't past stage 2 is not commenting at
the start of functions right and that's
a huge reason why the requirement exists
we want you to start your functions with
a comment explaining what the inputs
outputs and tasks of your function are
it's a great way actually not to do not
only to verify that that's what your
functions doing when you finished
writing it but to actually do it before
you can write it and start thinking
about those questions what are what are
my functions inputs what are its output
and what tasks could it actually
complete right and notice here that
we've we've noted what our function
needs to well function we've noted the
input here we taken the first person and
we know to the output what this function
is intended to do we print the first
person drinking coke so let's let's go
ahead and just try and code in
accordance with what it is we commented
I'm not kind of like made this in
beforehand
here we've noted that we want to have
three people we want to have want to
print ready to be printed and a chosen
Susie who's a fictitious character here
and me and Anthony and both could also
be fictional people yes I want them
today you never know who might be a
second roll out there definitely but um
that being said we're in a good place to
kind of build out this skeleton that
we've developed here in comments so here
we have a first function that kind of
defines a Suzy drinking coke here's a
second function with me drinking coke
and here's a function with Ethan
drinking coke and one thing that we kind
of didn't write was that we have to call
each one of these functions individually
so I see some issues with this with this
code already and I'm assuming that maybe
some student is saying this to you might
remember from the class that we talked
about a lot of big thing with functions
is that they help you avoid repetition
but I'm seeing I'm we're hoping some
students see this as well these three
functions look really really used
similar right Susie drinks Cobra whole
drinks coke Anthony drinks coke what
this is not doing is it's not extracting
the problem it's making it very specific
to a very specific type of problem does
suzie drink coke Luke does Rahul drink
Coke does Anthony drink coke right like
at they saying you know we've kind of
repeated exactly what it is that we're
doing so the thing that we went wrong
after we kind of broke down this problem
into into comments is that we didn't
really group together like and identify
what it is that is repeating in the task
that we created so we created this task
that we want to we got to show three
people and you got to share them
drinking but we didn't kind of ask
ourselves like what does it mean for a
person to Ben cook what does it mean for
a single instance of our problem and in
that way we could have grouped together
like the three functionalities here and
what we could have done is just
summarized these comments into one
comment that i'm going to right
underneath and that is takes as input a
string a person and princess person
drinking coke what's really key here as
I'm looking at rofls code here is he
saying a person he's not talking about
the first person or the second person
for hint hint your stage 2 project you
might want to be thinking about all
right not how do I make the easy level
work or the medium level but how do i
make a level work any level work right
that's going to be really really key to
succeeding at this project right so how
do i print just a single person well I
do this with the belief that once I find
a way to do this task for a single
person then it's just a matter of doing
this thing x number of times so what's
uh so one way that we can kind of
simplify this problem that we have here
is that we're really just taking a
person's name and just adding drinks
coke to it so in a way we just kind of
written out all of our code or first and
now we're trying to optimize for that so
say that we have like person drinks coke
and instead of doozy you just have
drinks coke and we pass in a person so
in this way we we can pass in whatever
we want for the input person and just
have person drinks coke so one way that
I've optimized you want to change that
so that we can actually print the
person's name as well oh yes that's
present I was just about to do right
cool so so here we've kind of like it
and in this function that I've now
written out here on line 22 here you'll
see that we take in drinks we takin a
person and drinks coke and we print out
person plus drinks coke now I'm not
gonna build this because it's a pretty
simple a problem but I think that you
can very obviously see how we've just
really condensed
these three functions into one by simply
thinking about like a person versus the
three people that we have to print out
so we can get rid of that and we just
lost like maybe 18 lines of code maybe
is surprisingly the number of lines that
it takes to not pass a submission so you
can see that just by this little
exercise we've been able to eliminate
like a huge portion of repeated
unnecessary code and with that you'll be
able to kind of kill two birds with one
stone by making a proper function and
not having it so long that it doesn't
pass a requirement so um and you'll see
that the functionality is essentially
the same we've just really just taken a
person and drinks coke so you might be
asking yourself um you know like what
does this have to do with our stage 2
project and I think that we've kind of
we've really just own down on the ideas
that we want to kind of get you guys to
instill within yourselves after like
doing this programming problem so after
you finish the stage 2 problem we were
hoping that'd be able to now abstract
parts of problem to make it easier to
understand how we can code it we want
you to kind of realize that by doing
this you've avoided repeating yourself
in the future and you prevented the
development of really long coat from the
very beginning you've also like
prevented yourselves from repeating your
code unnecessarily but I really kind of
breaking down the problem from the very
beginning and you refine your comments
as you kind of go through this process
of eliminating extra code because you'll
see that I took those three original
comments that i had in hashtags here and
i just condense it into one in the
proper format that we expect which I not
only say what the input to the function
is I also say what the function does
so that a nutshell is kind of what it is
that you want to take from this
particular example here and in again in
regards to what what it is this is
supposed to be analogous to in your
programming problem you want you to
think about the concept of a level in
the abstract sense right look don't
focus in so much on how do i make my
specific construction of a level work
how do i make my specific construction
of the easy level work if when you have
completed this project and you've done
it in a way that uses functions well
that uses functions that are generally
short and avoiding repetition what
you'll find is actually that your code
will work on any level constructed in
the way constructed in the expected
format so if your code works such that
blanks are defined as underscore
underscore one underscore underscore and
so on it will work on any string that
people construct in that fashion you
know you I could give you a random fill
in the blank quiz I built and it should
work in your code it's long as it's done
right right so that's kind of like a
source of a lot of problems that we have
and remember that in the skeleton
skeleton code that you receive that the
sample that you're given is an example
of a well um we have a we have a
question here long as you have your code
with you um asking about lions 12 13 and
14 so 12 13 and 14 right so Rahul can
you share your screen again and actually
show how you would call these functions
rather than so these functions that role
has at 12 13 14 are obviously no longer
in our code we no longer have as soon as
you drinks ruffled drinks for Anthony
drinks safely and so what we actually
want to do is just drinks coffee on
person 10 drinks coke on person one
drinks coke on person two drinks coke on
first and three
actually run this code just so you can
see what happens here so if we write we
can see in the output Susie drinks coke
Rahul drinks coke Anthony drinks coke
again all off of one function we do have
to call functions for each individual
time we want to like identified does a
single person drink coke that's a that's
a that's a result of our construction of
the function our functional only knows
if one single person drinks coke I
suppose you could construct a function
that could take in a list of people and
tell us who among them drinks coke but
that's a more complicated example maybe
that's something for you to try at home
yeah it might be something that you want
to implement for your stage 2 project
but the idea here is to kind of just
simplify your thinking when you're
trying to approach this problem and yeah
you like Anthony said we could probably
have something like person to or oops
person to or person 3 and then kind of
adjust the inputs here to person 1 B 2
etc but the idea here is to simply
extract away what's one needs to be done
though that we're working with something
sufficient enough to pass and pass like
all the requirements that we have so
let's stop share this for a sec and yeah
so so those are things that we wanted
you guys to kind of come out with like
think about a level in the objects hence
no three levels identify what a function
needs what what needs a function yeah
sorry identify what needs a function
after you've kind of broken down the
individual tests that you have for this
problem in comments yeah a really great
tip that I tell a lot of students when
you're writing a function really it
functions like going to perform some
task for you right so when you're
thinking about the big problem and you
identify the smaller
within that and you figure out okay I
want a function that does this
particular task within the project think
about two things before you write any of
the code and those two things are what
should i expect the result of my
function to be that's going to be your
output what comes at the return value
and the second piece is what information
do I need to get there what information
am i given such that I can achieve that
result and those are your inputs or your
parameters what goes in the parentheses
those are what's going to make things
generalizable and abstracted so that
you're able to write your code such that
it works on a abstract input rather than
a specific one yeah so that being said
some last-minute tips for some things at
at the notice and they may or may not
these things that you have to do if it
doesn't help your thinking then you have
to learn but so you can ignore it but so
one of the things that I don't suggest
you use is the exact mad libs code that
you've kind of worked through in the
work sessions the idea of kind of taking
the mavs loops code design is what you
want to retain from those exercises and
that design is the replacement of words
within a longer string that again like
is the essence of this project but you
need to kind of find a way to do that
without best without like using the
while loop and extra stuff that there I
shouldn't say like without using wow if
I don't want to get you guys confused
and don't use the exact code that you
used before because that can really like
add up in lines and it not only that it
kind of like takes away from the problem
at hand you want like previous problems
to inform the design
new problems but generally like when
you're approaching a programming problem
you want to break it down without any
interference from like other things that
you've learned and that's really
important because the problem that
you're looking at may not have anything
to do with like previous problems you've
seen before so make sure that your first
breaking down problem and you have like
those comments where you have exactly
whate want to do and then you can think
about what it is you didn't mad libs
that might help you in this particular
situation um we have a question that
popped up in the the general chat about
from Stefan um he's saying the feedback
he's received on this project says that
he shouldn't be using while loop sis I
go through the four questions so it's
hard to say I without seeing your code
and I'm not fully understanding your
interpretation of the reviewers feedback
but i'll try to answer that as best as
possible i would imagine so part of the
specification right is that the user can
select a level you might run into issues
um if you're having the user select a
level and then using a while loop to go
through that because then you're not
might not really be selecting like if
your while loop is always starting from
the easy question yet i'm selecting
medium then that's a dissociation
between what the user input is and what
your your code is doing so again really
difficult question to address here
without saying the code without seeing
the reviewer feedback essentially i
think it's a morse this issue sounds
like it might be more specific to your
code rather than to the concept of using
while loops there certainly is a place
for while loops on this problem in fact
it would be quite difficult to do it
without any to any looping there would
you what I want to suggest you're doing
what I suggest to you to do again think
about the task
so if there is a task which is select a
level maybe you want a function that
manages all the code that goes into
having the users select a level sorry
I'm just answering a pulse question I
don't know if you guys had trouble
seeing the lower left corner of the
sublime text but it was just printing
out the output and I just posted that in
the event chat if you're wondering about
that but exactly what Anthony's saying
you know it's it's really uh it's not
about kind of you like not using while
loop you're not using like a while loop
there also it's really about kind of
breaking down a problem and I can't
really stress this enough because it's
it's fundamental to coding before
because i'm sure you guys either have a
firm grasp of the concepts or can up out
of 10 on and then get a firm grasp of
like the programming concepts but just
problem solving in itself is a different
animal and we also want to kind of help
you guys get a mindset for that because
that's important moving on when you see
other sorts of problems that you might
be faced with um but yeah so we have
time for a lot more questions if you if
you have or any questions that you might
have yeah so we'll stick around for a
little while ausa Q&amp;amp;A is open the chat
is open feel free to chat us ask us
questions they're also be a quick survey
sent out on the chat um asking about how
you felt about this new service that
we're testing out here we're hoping it's
an improvement over google hangouts
which we can using previously so the
survey was just posted in the chat
please please take that if you have time
yeah feel free to use the QA to ask any
questions you have royalty of any last
tips so you can think of while we're
waiting for questions to come in
actually it's one that we didn't talk
about
I there's a huge thing in less than 2.7
Dave talks about this a little bit with
the days between dates a problem and one
of the things he there's again he breaks
that down into several tests and he
talked about you know the functions that
we should use for it and what what goes
into that um I'll finish up my thought
here you've addressed the question um
one of the things he mentioned is that
one of the tasks is identifying is a
year a leap year and he mentions that
that's a very actually a very easy
problem to solve and the scope of the
larger the larger problem but he
actually saves that for the last thing
that he does and the reason why he does
that is because um evaluating whether a
year is a leap year well that problem in
itself is a little easy it complicates
the larger problem that makes writing
the rest of the code more difficult to
me that's very analogous to the stage to
project in the idea of having the user
pick a level and one thing that I see a
lot of students do is that's the first
thing they do is they write some code
they write some function that allows the
user to select one of three levels and
honestly that's probably one of the
easier functions to write in this
assignment I don't recommend starting
there for the same reason the Dave does
not start with the leap year it
complicates the rest of your code
because now all the sudden you're
thinking about three different levels
and you might start falling into that
mistake that we talked about earlier
where ever I you're thinking about my
specific levels rather than a level so I
really recommend you select you create
one example level to run your coat on
and get your code to work on that single
level first in a generalizable way in an
abstract way and then once you've done
that then you can start thinking okay so
now how do i get my user to you to have
three different levels available to them
you'll actually find that very very easy
to do if it can work on a level
so a couple of questions here in the
chat d and asking how much does the raw
input part of the quiz affect the
complexity of my code but um I mean I'm
just going to answer that without loud
here for people who may be on QA um so
yeah that's as Rahul said it's a
necessary part of the program it's just
one line of code that's what's going to
allow the user to respond I the syntax
for raw input is simply you assign raw
input to some variable and in
parenthesis for raw input you have a
string that string is what displays to
the user and then what they type next
and hit enter get saved to the variable
and then you can manage that how you see
fit evaluate the answer is correct I do
whatever you need to do for the problem
sure look at let's look at take a look
at pulse a question which is which I
like it's he's asking can you show us
how to use comments to plan out your
code I'm having trouble figuring out
what functions to make I'm glad that you
could have made the analogy between
comments and functions because that's
when we were trying to over him with
this webcast but so it's use comments to
plan out the code the way I generally do
it um using comments to plan of the code
is that I used the task that i'm given
to form the comments and i hope you see
hope you guys saw that when I kind of
broke down the question that i gave
myself which is show a user three
different people drinking coke I
basically literally like took the words
from the task and put it in comments um
in in certain places in order to kind of
identify directly what it is I have to
do because by taking the very question
that I'm being asked I can really like
just on its face answer the question
like right away and after I've kind of
written out code and written out
comments and got a basic functionality
down then I can kind of go back and at
least argue that you know I literally
took
that I was given and answered it a great
place to start would be the project
specification that tells you what you're
supposed to do for this project and
that's going to lay out essentially the
rules of the game right so it's going to
say it has to display the display the
question first and it has to ask the
user for input then it should evaluate
those are maybe things that you want to
think about making functions and you
might want to thank okay so which of
these are tasks that belong to that then
I might have to repeat and that should
appear in a function in some way yeah
I'm real glad you mentioned that because
I think that we give a lot of
information that sometimes might seem
convoluted in the sample code that we
give you so what does he guess is kind
of just erasing parts of prompt that we
give you that and only leaving like
little action items like literally break
it down into steps and like step one
step two step three yeah and then go
forth and they're literally in comments
already so right then they're surely
have like your test comment 0 comments
are a great way to store those like or
is it some people call it pseudocode
essentially it's like a step-by-step
process and algorithm towards solving
the problem but not written in a
computer programming language um
Jennifer also has a question so as far
as asking the user to choose a level in
our quiz is appropriate to use if-else
statements protrusive level yes in fact
that's probably one of the best ways to
do it I it kind of goes on on
programming style but essentially I
guess two ways you could do this is one
you could do it the global level meaning
not inside of any function and just that
code is run immediately upon that when
you run the file or you could do it in a
function itself I personally am a
proponent of thinking that code
shouldn't be written at the global level
but that's going to be up to you and
your personal preference and style to
decide that but really I mean you can
think about it like this right like so
you have some prompt saying you know
please select the level you're going to
get
that users response and then you want to
find out if they said easy if they said
medium if they said hard or if they said
something else um if you start to think
if you start to like save problems like
that aloud to yourself they kind of give
you hints about like what coding
techniques you might find helpful here
uh yeah use these keywords and it's like
it if is a keyword and Python because it
as you know it means something it's not
like it's just some like weird word it's
always like if this condition then do
something else that's that's English so
uh I think that we're well unless anyone
has any more questions we can kind of
wrap this up right now but uh seems like
you guys have been asking some great
questions and from the questions that
you've been asking it Dean that you have
hopefully gained a better mindset of how
to tackle not only this problem but
other problems that you might face not
only in this and agree but in the future
of your program and career so if if
that's the last question I think that we
can kind of in this webcast yeah sounds
good to me awesome thanks for tuning in
today I fill out the survey um good luck
with stage two we're here to help you if
you need more help eat your vegetables
these your vegetables you get hurt see
