through all of this binomial
distribution stuff and flipped so many
coins the reason is you're going to move
now towards what's perhaps the most deep
insight in all of statistics it's called
the central limit theorem and the way I
want you to get there is to a
programming exercise now I told you that
all the programming is optional and you
can totally skip this one but I beg you
stay with me what you're about to see is
perhaps the most interesting way to
understand the central limit theorem and
statistics of large numbers so in Simon
number one I literally want you to flip
a coin 1,000 times and once you've done
this I want you to compute the mean of
the outcome and the standard deviation
flipping a coin is a random event it
gives us things like zero or one says
outcomes like this thing over here if
you do that a thousand times for a fair
coin you expect the outcome of the mean
to be 0.5 you probably have no clue what
to expect for the standard deviation
there's a couple of things I want to
give you in your programming environment
you'll find the function mean the
function variance and the function
standard deviation as he's practiced it
before I modified it a little bit to
make sure that whatever you do is of
type float what you need for computing
the mean otherwise it might be of type
integer and then these calculations all
go wrong same over here in the
computation of the variance but ignore
the float type conversion other than
that is exactly what I've shown you
before I now want you to implement the
function flip that takes as an argument
the number of coin flips you want to do
a thousand in this case and then uses
the function mean in standard deviation
to compute the mean and Sandy Asian of
the resulting sequence of outcomes this
will be a list filled with zeros or ones
the thing to know is that with the
function random dot random it's two of
them
the dot in the middle gives you a random
value that sits between 0 and 1 every
time you call this function you get a
different random value which is nice
because you just have to call this a
thousand times to get a thousand samples
but they're in the interval of 0 &amp;amp; 1 and
you want
then back into a coin flips so what do
you have to do is to call this
expression here and this expression over
here will give you true or false which
is the same for the purpose here of 1 &amp;amp;
0 it gives you true if the random
variable happens to be louder than 0.5
and false if it's smaller so if you
somehow call this thing a thousand times
and make a list of these thousand
outcomes and put that code and in the
function flip that it returns that list
then you're done so here's a typical
outcome for this code if I run it the
mean might be point four eight four
there's a standard deviation if I run it
again I get a different mean zero point
five one and different standard
deviation</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
