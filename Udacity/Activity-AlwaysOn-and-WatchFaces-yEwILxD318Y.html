of showing information to the user but
you might be confused as to which is the
most appropriate for different
situations so here's a quick rundown of
when to use each one of the following
notifications regular activity always on
activity or watch face let's discuss why
you would use one over the other
notifications are best when you need to
get the users attention right now you
have a picnic coming up in 10 minutes so
you need to do something about this
straightaway the information will
probably be out of date after an hour
notifications will cause the wearable to
vibrate ensuring the user then glances
of the device to see what they need to
know regular activities are great when
you need to take care of some action
right now such as sending a text message
to a friend you want the activity to
take over the whole display show what
you just spoke send the message and then
disappear you might also want to get
more detail about the weather for the
week you can scroll through a list to
see what the temperatures are for each
day but this is not something you want
to always be visible when the user is
busy doing other things these regular
activities will disappear when the watch
goes in ambient mode and the default
watch face will then be shown always on
activities are special because when the
watch goes into ambient mode after a
timeout the app continues to run but the
display goes into a low-power mode the
app draws itself with much lower detail
so it looks good with a reduced number
of pixels illuminated this would be
great for a navigation app when the user
is not looking at the display the user
saves power but the interface is ready
to be resumed to this one here whenever
the user wakes it up the user can
dismiss the always-on app when they have
finished the task they're performing but
then they can control how long this task
happens for and finally there are watch
faces these are selected by the user as
the default watch face and the wearable
shows this whenever there is nothing
else to show the user is going to be
glancing at this all day to find out
what time it is and what important
things there are that are going on in
their lives</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
