recreate visualizations we need to
understand data and data types almost
anything can be turned into data let's
take a look at a well noted graphic and
see it's data types this visualization
comes from Hans Rosling's work with
global health data if you have five
minutes I highly encourage you to watch
Hans narrate this visualization and the
video linked in the instructor notes han
gives a charismatic performance that
makes this data come alive now I want to
highlight the different data types that
can be found in this visualization let's
start with the quantitative data or any
variables that have exact numbers these
include variables like life expectancy
income per person total population and
year quantitative data can be discrete
or continuous
and typically variables that are
countable are considered discrete in
this case total population would be
considered a discrete variable while
income per person would be a continuous
variable another data type that appears
in this visualization is categorical
data nominal data is a way of labeling
or categorizing the data into groups in
this case the countries of the world are
grouped into regions the Americas are
colored yellow and sub-saharan Africa is
colored blue categorical data may take
on numerical values but these numerical
values won't necessarily carry any
mathematical meeting one final type of
data not shown in this visualization is
ordered data order data is similar to
categorical data except that the
categories are ordered or ranked in some
particular way one example would be is
if I took the populations of each
country and then split them up into bins
for example I could have four groups
where each of the countries falls into a
population bin if their population is
between zero and ten million ten and 100
million one hundred and five hundred
million or greater than 500 million in
this example we're pretty much just
taking quantitative data and splitting
it into groups so we have bins or
categories of other types of data a
slightly different example would be
class difficult
such as beginner-intermediate in advance
those three types of classes would be a
way that we could label the classes and
they have a natural order in increasing
difficulty as data scientist it's
important for us to know that each of
these data types can be encoded visually
and in the next few videos we'll dive
into how we can make appropriate choices
for visual encodings based on the
different data types this was just a
brief overview of data types and if
these concepts are still a bit fuzzy for
you we recommend that you watch the
three videos from the instruction to
data science class these videos are
linked in the instructor notes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
