they're there hopefully you have some
questions about how the GPU works since
we've just sort of been telling you
about threads and thread blocks without
giving you much motivation so you might
be wondering why do we divide the
problem into blocks when two blocks get
and run and if you have a whole bunch of
thread blocks in what order do they run
and I've told you that thread blocks
were about letting groups of threads
cooperate but I haven't told you how
those threads cooperate or with what
limitations to answer this we're going
to have to dive in to learn a little bit
more about the GPU hardware at a high
level a CUDA GPU is a bunch of these we
call them streaming multi processors or
SMS for short
now different GPUs have a different
number of SMS so a small GPU might only
have one SM whereas a really big GPU
might have 16 SMS for example an SM
intern has many simple processors that
can run a bunch of parallel threads it
also has some other things like some
memory I will talk more about in a
moment so when you've got a CUDA program
with a bunch of threads organized into
thread blocks the important thing to
understand is that the GPU is
responsible for allocating blocks to SMS
let me say that again because it's
really important the GPU is responsible
for allocating the blocks to the SMS so
as the programmer all you have to worry
about is giving the GPU a big pile of
thread blocks and the GPU will take care
of assigning them to run on the hardware
SMS all the SMS run in parallel and
independently</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
