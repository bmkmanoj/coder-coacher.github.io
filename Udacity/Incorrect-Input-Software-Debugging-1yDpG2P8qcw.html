there's no bug in here but there's
nothing in there which prevents misuse
of my class for instance nothing
prevents me from entering numbers in
here which make no sense at all for
instance I could enter minus 1 as the
hour or minus 2 as the minute or minus 3
as the second this is not a valid time
or we would have to come up with
entirely new definition of what a valid
time is however we can still instantiate
such an object and even print it out
comes as minus one call on minus 2 colon
minus 3 so here we're still talking
three numbers but since Python does not
provide aesthetic checking of types that
is checking of types when the program is
being compiled rather than executed
there's nothing that prevents me from
passing objects which have a completely
different type so I could pass a string
in here for instance and then hours
would be initialized with a string this
means that I would get a time object in
here which is entirely invalid so my
situation is and passing some string
here in the hours attribute and now for
a quiz so if I do this do i get an error
when initializing the time object or
when printing the time object or never</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
