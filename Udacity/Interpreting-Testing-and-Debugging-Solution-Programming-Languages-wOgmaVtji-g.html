assistant instructor for web
applications engineering Peter
unfortunately couldn't be here because
he's off doing something silly like
graduating so you're stuck with me so
let's just jump right into the homework
solutions the first question was about
interpreting testing and debugging
actually all the homeworks are about
that and this question starts off with
just quiz first off embedded JavaScript
programs use functions like document dot
write to change the surrounding web page
yes this is true we can take a quick
look at something like this so I've
loaded up this HTML into a file and you
can see there's a bit of a javascript in
the script tag here just a simple
factorial function and then it uses the
document dot write method to write out
the factorial 5 which is 120 and then
write out the expression 5 is equal to 5
so this should write out 120 and then
true so if we load this up in our web
browser we see that at the end of this
it has modified the web page to write
120 and true now we haven't done any
kind of styling to this so it's just
running right into each other but the
point remains that the document dot
write function is really how you modify
on a basic level the overriding HTML
page now next part testing can prove
that a web browser is correct that is
not true so we can take a look at an
example of that too so let's say I have
a basic square function well actually
not a basic square function it's much
more complicated than it needs to be but
let's see about if we can prove this is
true with some test cases so let's print
out some test cases say print square 3
and this if we run it okay that prints
out nine that makes sense but then if we
print out another test case and we see
this as 92 which is what we expect so
I'm just going to print out a few more
test cases okay we've got a few more
test cases here and we can already tell
square
zero should be zero and the square of
two should be four so you go ahead and
run these and we get the expected output
now are we done here have we proved that
this is correct well obviously not
because if you look at the code this
isn't going to return the square of X
for anything that is where mod 2 equals
0 and X is not to works fine for X is 2
but when we print out square of 4 which
should be 16 but we instead get is 8
which not at all what we want so testing
is great having simple small unit tests
is a good habit to get into but you
can't really test for every single
possible input it's just not feasible so
you should be prepared for accepting
that your code is probably right but you
can't guarantee it with testing okay the
third part program should compute
different answers before and after it
has been optimized now this is
definitely not true program should be
correct now what correct is it can vary
depending on what your actual goals are
but the program should work as you
intended and once you start optimizing
things that shouldn't change now the
final part of this quiz is making
changes to a test case can help to
localize a program bug and yes this is
true and we can see an example of this
and this is actually fairly similar to
what we were doing before so we've got
an absolute value function and let's say
I've already told you that something's
wrong with it and I want you to find
where the bug is well where do we start
let's try printing out the absolute
value of one because we're trying to
break down what part what branch of this
function the bug that I've already told
you about is in so we want to
differentiate between positive values
and negative values in zero is that
breaks it down to one of these two
statements and we get out one which is
the absolute value of one so okay that
seems ok now let's try and narrow it
down a bit further from there
okay so let's narrow it down a bit
further and now let's do the absolute
value of 8 which still right here it's
still going to be in this else statement
but since it's greater than 2 it's going
to go into this internal if statement
instead of this other else so when we
run this we get zero not eight so we see
that the bug is in this and it's fairly
clear that that's where it is in most
programs that you're debugging this is
not going to be this simple but you can
add additional test cases and use your
test cases to narrow down what part of
your function the errors are in and
that's really the point of this right
