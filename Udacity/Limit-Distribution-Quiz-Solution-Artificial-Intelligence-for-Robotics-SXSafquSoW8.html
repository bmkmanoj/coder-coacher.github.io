it's the uniform distribution and
there's an intuitive reasoning behind us
every time we move we lose information
that is in the initial distribution we
know exactly where we are one step in we
have a point a chance but the point
eight will fall to something smaller as
we move on point six four and so on
the distribution of the absolute least
information is the uniform distribution
has no preference whatsoever and that's
really the result of moving many many
times there's a way to derive this
mathematically but I can prove a
property that's highly related which is
a balance property say we take X 4 and
we'd like to understand how X 4 at some
time step T corresponds to the previous
time distribution over all these
variables for this to be stationary it
has to be the same but differently the
probability of X 4 must be the same as
0.8 probability of X 2 plus 0.1
probability of X 1 plus 0.1 probability
of X Li there's exactly the same
calculation we did before where we ask
what's the chance of being X 4 well you
might be coming from X to X 1 or X 3 and
there's these probability is point 8
point one and point one they govern
likely what you might have been coming
from there those together must hold true
in the limit when things don't move
anymore now you might think there's many
different ways to solve this and the
point - it's just one solution but it
turns out point two is the only solution
so if we plug in point 2 over here point
two over here point over here we get 1
times point two and that's point two on
the right side so clearly those points -
over here me to the balance that is
necessary to define a valid solution in
the limit</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
