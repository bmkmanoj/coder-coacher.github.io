like to get to our algorithms for doing
optimization and I think to do that it's
helpful to do a quiz so here is a little
quiz that I put together
I call it optimize me and what I want
you to do is is here's two different
problems there's two different input
spaces two different functions and I
want you to find the optimal X star or
something really close to it if you
can't get it exactly right so the first
question we've got the input space X is
the values 1 to 100 and the function
that we're trying to optimize is X mod 6
squared mod 7 minus the sine of X holy
cow yeah it's it's a it is an
awesome-looking function do you want to
see it like I might be able to plot it
for you sure I'd love to see plug
because then maybe I'll know for how to
figure out the answer oh yeah well maybe
I should not then maybe I should wait
until we already have an answer and then
yeah let's let's let's wait up but I'll
show you after it it's it's crazy all
right
it's beautiful so okay good so and the
second problem we've got X as the set of
real numbers so all any possible number
in the reals and the function that we're
trying to optimize is negative x to the
4th plus a thousand x cubed minus 20 x
squared plus 4x minus 6 all right so you
understand the questions I understand
the question yes good good luck with
them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
