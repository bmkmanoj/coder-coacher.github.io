C++ programs opens the door for many
many ways of abusing the system you may
have heard of buffer overflows which
exploit precisely this flaw in C and C++
where people not only read but right
beyond the elements of an array in order
to supplant malicious code in select
locations of the memory this opens the
door for all sorts of interesting hacks
of course how can one detect such errors
what we need is a system invariant that
continuously checks the boundaries of an
array against reads and writes what a
tool can do for instance is constantly
monitor the uninitialized areas for
reads and writes with every single
instruction that is and whenever the
program tries to access some system
memory that is not allocated what will
happen is that the invariant checker
raises an exception or otherwise aborts
the program and therefore allows us to
detect this kind of error tools for C
and C++ would you do that include tools
like electric fence which does precisely
that places these blocks in front and
before every allocated block and
therefore detects when reads and writes
happen outside of these allocated areas
and the second important tool here is
valgrind which actually is an
interpreter for x86 binaries and which
also allows to monitor accesses to non
initialized code for C and C++ programs</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
