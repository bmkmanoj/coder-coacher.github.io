course developer here at Udacity thank
you so much for talking to me today how
could be her so I'm cameras here to talk
about some use of games and education
and so I know you did something really
cool back when you taught in high school
with games in your high school classroom
so can you tell us a little bit about
that sure so I was teaching high school
physics and I realized I wanted a better
lab simulator it's really hard to find
lab supply sometimes and it's sometimes
a lot easier to use something virtual so
I decided to use a video game because
they're easily accessible and readily
available and I wound up using the video
game portal 2 to teach physics portal 2
has a puzzle maker in it and this puzzle
maker makes it really really easy to
make a level in about five minutes it
really is so simple that even somebody
who has never even really used a
computer before it can figure it out all
you need to use is click and drag and
maybe one or two clicks and you actually
have a full-blown level and because the
game is essentially a physics puzzle
game the game itself follows the laws of
physics so what I have my students doing
is building levels in the game that were
essentially experiments and then I had
them running experiments collecting data
and then comparing the data they were
collecting to what they would expect to
see in the real world which was pretty
cool it was pretty wild we wound up
doing about I think 10 labs in the class
we did everything from simple momentum
in motion to kinetic energy potential
energy we even did some thermodynamics
in the game which is pretty well because
the laws of physics hold up that well
that essentially we could throw a bunch
of objects bouncing off each other into
a level and it kind of sort of followed
the laws of thermodynamics which is
amazing we had some other cool ones with
terminal velocity and yeah I just have
my students comparing what they saw to
what they would see in the real world
and it wound up being a really really
fun semester yeah I bet they really got
a kick out of that um so for any of our
students who might develop games to be
used in the classroom what do you think
what do you need to think about when
you're developing games to class make
sure they're really a learning
experience and not a distraction for the
students are just into they kind of have
fun playing around with and don't learn
anything from sure well it's important
remember that games are a means to an
end and just one tool amongst many that
teachers have at their disposal so I
think the idea here is just simply make
sure
that the game like the fun mechanics of
the game are teaching what you want
students to learn so I kind of saw using
portal as a way to engage students
because immediately you're using a video
game which is something new and
different that students aren't familiar
with normally in a classroom but they
love outside of the classroom so I had
their attention and that's like half the
battle in a physics class I was really
happy about that and then the other
thing that I was really happy about is
that the actual mechanics of the game
reflected exactly what I wanted students
to be learning at that time so you know
there are a number of ways that you can
make an educational game just awful for
instance you could create like let's say
a fighting game you like a beat'em up
game but instead of like getting a new
life at the end of the level you have to
solve some math problems then you get a
new life like that's silly that's dumb
that's just a big distraction what you
would want to do instead is create a
game maybe like a dragon box have you
ever heard of that one I I have that now
it's awesome it's an algebra game and
it's essentially it looks like a card
game but it follows the laws of algebra
you have to put cards in certain places
and what you're really doing there is
having fun with fractions in cross
multiplying and it's actually a ton of
fun and it's not a distraction
whatsoever because the actual fun game
mechanic is teaching algebra huh yeah
very interesting now the one thing I
feel it's worth noting though is that
there are those in the education
community which interest of full
disclosure I'm one of them there are
often dubious about the use of games in
education mostly because many of us
think that it's really important to make
the material appealing in and of itself
that if we have to put a game on it we
kinda already fought a losing battle and
now when they move on to a class that
doesn't use games they're just going to
tune out because I'm used to learning
being very engaging and fun because it
was a game attached to it and now I
don't learn in the real world and what
would you say to people like me who have
that criticism about this it doesn't
sound like that applies to the portal to
thing but for other games what would you
say to that I understand that concern
you know I love physics and I think
physics in and of itself should be super
interesting same thing with basically
all science or engineering and tech but
for instance if I were learning let's
say I don't know what did not like in
school actually liked all my classes
you're not the target audience yes but
you know I think it's just one tool of
many you know and if it's a distraction
and if it takes away from the fun or the
essence of the material itself you
probably just simply using the
wrong it's a tool like anything else
it's just another media form you have
videos you have books you have audio
these are all very valid and relevant
media sources to learn anything and now
you have games games are just another
way of interacting with material and so
despite the fact that normally they're
associated with fun and you know they
could potentially be distracting if used
in the right way I think there's really
nothing to fear there I think you're
getting a really important distinction
which is between using games for
education and gamifying education which
are two very different things when we
attach these badges and things like that
to education it can apply some
motivators but they're really extrinsic
motivators which might not get to the
heart of what we really want to do in
education so I'm hit me final thoughts
for our students who might be looking at
doing a game for their class project
here you should go for it it's fun it's
so much fun and when you see kids when
you see their eyes light up when you see
them get really excited about playing a
game and feel motivated to solve the
kind of problems that you want them to
solve that's awesome it's great it's a
fantastic feeling but at the end of the
day it's just a lot of fun I mean you're
adding fun to the classroom and there's
really no reason that learning can't be
super enjoyable for everybody involved
so I say go for it have a good time cool
well thank you so much for talking to us
yeah and have a great rest of your day
happy to be here thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
