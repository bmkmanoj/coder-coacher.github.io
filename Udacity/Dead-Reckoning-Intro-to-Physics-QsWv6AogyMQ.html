reckoning dead reckoning is the method
that Mariners used to use to estimate
their position at sea and they did this
by keeping a log book of the direction
they were heading the speed they were
moving in and the duration that they
move to that speed and direction in one
particular journey worship wants to get
from start to finish the ship starts out
by going east at a speed of 12 km/h for
2.5 hours the ship then heads south at
20 kilometers per hour for one hour east
of 15 kilometers per hour for three
hours and then finally northeast at
eight kilometers an hour for one hour my
question is what's the straight-line
distance between start and finish and by
straight line distance I mean this
distance from start to finish not the
total distance the ship travel because
the ship took a slightly inefficient
route now this is a sort of tricky
problem but as long as you keep track of
your trigonometry and geometry and you
will have to make some right triangles
you'll be able to get this one right
