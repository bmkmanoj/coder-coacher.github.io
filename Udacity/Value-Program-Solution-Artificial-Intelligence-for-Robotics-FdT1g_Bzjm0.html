be relatively straightforward we have a
value function is of the same size as my
world and I initialized with 99
everywhere this has to be a value that's
large enough it doesn't conflict with
any actual value I now update the value
function a number of times I don't know
how often but as long as I change
something I update it they fr introduced
the variable change which is set to true
in the beginning and why it changes the
case I update but it neatly set changed
to false and the only way to come back
to true is that I actually changed
something now I go through all the grid
cells in a fixed order happens to be not
very efficient but certainly gets the
job done I first check if the grid cell
I'm considering is the goal and he has a
typical case where a check for change if
the value is presently correctly that's
a zero I don't do anything but it was
larger than zero it is 99 then I set it
down to zero and I've just changed
something so therefore I'd said that
change flag back to true if it's not a
gold cell then here's my full update
function I go through all the actions I
project a potential next state upon
executing an action by adding the
corresponding Delta to the X&amp;amp;Y it gives
me x2 and y2 I test whether x2 and y2
are legitimate states for that they have
to be inside the grid so I check whether
the numbers are larger than 0 and
smaller than the dimension of the grid
and it has to be an actual navigable
grid cell so therefore it's checked by
the coordinates in the grid has a zero
if that's the case I can propagate back
the value my new value is the way of
this future grid cell plus the cost per
step which happens to be one now if this
value is better than the value I have
already what it means is smaller then
I'll assign this new value to my
original grid cell x and y plus of
course the cost step and then I know
I've changed something so therefore has
said change to true and the procedure
repeats the only thing missing at the
very end when I'm done I print out the
value function using these comb
over here so I should have warned you
this is not very efficient and the
reason why it's not efficient is the
values slowly propagates from the end
towards the beginning but leaving this
concern aside actually computes the
correct value function there's ways to
make it more efficient it's also
interesting to see what happens if I cut
off any path to the goal and then the
resulting value function will retain 99s
for most of the state variables exactly
those were there's no valid path to the
goal</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
