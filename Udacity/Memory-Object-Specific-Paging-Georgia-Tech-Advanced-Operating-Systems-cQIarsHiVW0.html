is responsible for an address space that
it is governing and this is the guy that
is going to worry about breaking a
linear address space into regions and
mapping those regions to specific memory
objects for a particular process that is
living in an address space to access a
particular memory object obviously this
memory object has to be brought into
DRAM and that is what a pager object is
going to do which is equivalent to the
idea of what is called external pages in
other systems such as Mark a pager
object is responsible for making or
establishing the connection between
virtual memory and physical memory and a
portion of the virtual memory that is a
region of the linear address space it
will map to this memory object and it is
a responsibility of the spacer object to
make sure that this memory object has a
representation in the physical memory
when the process wants to access that
portion of the address space range that
corresponds to this memory object so
this pager object creates what is called
a cached object representation for the
memory object in the DRAM so now the
portion of the address space that is the
region of the address space that this
virtual memory manager map to this
memory object one becomes available for
the process to address in its d-damn
because of the work done by the spacer
object in mapping this memory object
into the steel and similarly a different
virtual memory manager object managing a
different address space can similarly
map another memory object and create a
cached representation for this address
space to map a region of its address
space to this memory object using this
pager object I mentioned that the
address space manager can make any
number of such mapping between regions
of the linear address space and memory
objects for instance there is another
region of the linear address space that
is mapped to this memory object too and
there may be a pager object that governs
the paging of this object into
a dram representation so there is a
cached object representation for this
memory object which is part of the
region of the linear address space of a
particular process managed by this vm m
1 so in this example this page of one is
a pager for two distinct memory objects
memory object 1 and memory object to and
which are cached by vm m 1 on behalf of
a process so there are two pager objects
one for each one of these things so the
important point I want to get across as
that there is not a single paging
mechanism that need to be used for all
the memory objects so it gives you an
ability to have different regions of the
linear address space of a given process
by associating different pager objects
with each of the regions that correspond
to a particular memory object and all
these associations between regions and
memory objects can be dynamically
created so for instance this address
space manager may decide to associate a
region in this linear address space to
this memory object if it does that then
there is a new pager object that is
going to manage the association between
the region of the virtual address space
that is mapped to this memory object 3
and the cached object representation is
the drm representation of this memory
object created by a pager object that is
managing the relationship between this
region and this particular memory object
3 now this is an interesting situation
because you have a memory object that is
shared by two different address spaces
and there are two distinct pager objects
associated with managing the region of
the address space in VMM one that maps
to this memory object and the region of
the address space nvmm to that maps to
the same memory object now what about
the coherence of the cache
representation of this object that
exists over here and the cached
representation of this object that
exists over here who manages that well
it's entirely up to the pager object
that have been instantiated in order to
manage the mapping between this memory
object and the cached object so if
coherence is needed for
cash representation of this memory
object in the DM of this address space
in this address space then it is a
responsibility of these two pager
objects to coordinate that so it's not
something that spring system is
responsible for but it provides the
basic mechanisms through which these
entities can manage the legions that
they are mapping in terms of the memory
objects and the DM representation of
those objects so in other words external
pages establish the mapping between
virtual memory which is indicated by
these memory objects and physical memory
which is represented by the cached
objects so in summary the way memory
management works in the spring system is
the address space managers are
responsible for managing the linear
address space of a process and they do
the mapping of the linear address space
of a process by carving them up into
regions and associating the regions with
different memory objects and these
memory amex maybe swamp space on the
disk or it could be files that are being
mapped into specific regions of the
linear address space entirely up to the
application what they want to do with it
but these abstractions are powerful for
facilitating whatever may be the intent
of the user and mapping the memory
objects to the cache representation
which lives in DRAM is the
responsibility of pager objects and you
can have any number of external pages
that manage this mapping and in
particular through this example I've
shown you that you can have for a single
linear address space multiple pager
objects that are managing different
regions of that same address space and
that's the flexibility and power that's
available in the structure of the spring
system using the object technology</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
