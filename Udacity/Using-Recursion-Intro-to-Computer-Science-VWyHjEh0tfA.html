recursive definition versus a while loop
so this is a good question and the in
terms of being able to solve a problem
anything you can do with recursion you
can also do with a while loop anything
you can do with a while loop you could
also do with recursion so any problem
you could solve either way usually
solving it where the while loop would be
more efficient because you don't have
the over ahead of all the extra
procedure calls often solving it with
recursion is a simpler and more elegant
solution so depending on what's more
important often times the trade-off is
much better where the simpler elegant
solution that performance difference you
probably couldn't even measure unless
you were you know timing really
carefully for really large inputs you
wouldn't notice the difference so it's
more important to get the solution
correct and have it in code that's
easier for you to write an easier for
other people that understand and many
problems the recursive solution really
lends itself to that it's much shorter
than the iterative solution would be and
it's easier to understand and follow in
places where performance matters and we
saw this with the Fibonacci example that
if you end up blowing up the number of
calls in a way that makes it too slow to
do recursively you might prefer more
complicated solution that involves a
while loop and avoids the recursive
calls</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
