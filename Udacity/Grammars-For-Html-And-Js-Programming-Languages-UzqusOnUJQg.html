essential ambiguity we needed to handle
that before we could move farther with
our web browser but now that we know a
bit more about grammars and ambiguity we
can actually move on to making grammars
for HTML and JavaScript and just to
remind you here's an example HTML
utterance welcome to my web page here
I've drawn a relatively simple grammar
for a surprisingly large subset of HTML
one of the first challenges that will
have to deal with is that a web page can
have a list of words like welcome to my
web page so our starting non-terminal
HTML has a recursive structure using
this rule HTML goes to element HTML we
can apply rule one over and over again
to get as many elements as we need maybe
one two three four four welcome to my
web page and then eventually when we're
done replace with epsilon with the
empties and element can either be a word
like welcome to my web page or the
beginning of a nested tag so here tag
open and tag clothes are a lot like open
parenthesis and closed parenthesis
whenever we make one we're going to make
the other and then in here tag open is
angle bracket word close angle bracket
and tagged closed is left angle / word
right angle so for example this part
matches a tag open and this text matches
a tag close actually as it stands i'm
only allowing a single word to be inside
any tag and inside these bold tags we've
got quite a lot of stuff going on to
show you the power of a recursive
grammar oh yeah watch this trick now at
the top level an HTML document is a list
of elements as many as you like each one
of those elements may themselves be a
tag and inside tags we have another list
of elements another in
entire webpage so here at the top level
we just have one tag open for bold but
inside it there are four elements the
word welcome the word to the tag open
for my and the word for web page I'm
going to draw the parse tree for this
utterance using our grammar i'm going to
use ELT to abbreviate for element i'm
going to use t 0 for tag open and TC for
tag close now I've only drawn or
sketched out a small portion maybe about
half of this parse tree but we're still
going to be able to see how things match
up by comparing the leaves remember a
leaf is a node without any children to
what we saw in the original string here
my first leaf working my way down into
the left is this open left angle bracket
and that matches up here my next is this
B matches up here matches up there and
then after that tag open there's an HTML
which is an element list and the first
one is the word welcome the next one is
the word to now although this tree
structure is cumbersome for us it's very
convenient for computers because it
tells us exactly which part of the tree
to draw or to apply in a certain manner
it might not be obvious which word
should be bolded or which word should be
italicized but if I have a tag open and
a tag close this entire subtree is
influenced by this tag how much of the
webpage is bolded exactly this part over
here the bolds great grade uncle or
something like that might go up a few
over one to the right and then back down
we're going to use this special
structuring to help write our web
browser</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
