definitely want to match single words
and then you can possibly have one - and
then you could have more letters if you
like this regular expression definitely
matches well-liked
it also matches HTML maybe the HTM will
match the first part in the L will match
the second part and it definitely
rejects a B C and a - - B however one
problem with this regular expression is
that it does not accept single letter
words like a or I and to see why just
look at these two plus signs this
requires one or more letters here and
one or more letters there that's at
least two letters we might be tempted to
fix it up by making one of these a star
but now we mistakenly accept things like
just - a no letters here the - and then
some more letters well that didn't work
what if I try to make the other one a
star
well dual problem now will mistakenly
accept things like a - well this is a
bit of a challenge what we really want
is for this - and the second word to be
grouped together and either they're both
there or they're not as if I really want
this question mark to apply to both the
- and also the A through Z plus we don't
know how to do that yet but you'll get a
chance after we've learned how to fix
this up in the homework</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
