produce a list of words from a string
which is separated either by white space
or tags so you've got to strip out all
the tags and we have tags here here here
here and here now we can't just remove
the tags completely because then we'd
have title and this written as one word
and we don't want that so the first
thing I'm going to do is I'm going to
remove the tags I'm going to search for
the first tag the opening tag and the
closing tag and then I'm going to remove
the whole of the tag but I'm not just
going to remove it I'm going to replace
it with a space because replacing it by
a space means that I don't have the
problem with things like title this
being run into one word and once I've
got all the tags replaced by spaces I'm
going to use the split that we've used
before which splits on white space so
having several spaces in a row is not a
problem because split removes the lot of
them so now to look at how to code that
we're asked to define a function remove
tag it takes a string as its input and
what I'm going to do first is I'm going
to look for the start position in the
string the start position of the first
opening bracket and I'm also going to
need to find the end of the bracket at
the end of the same tag so just to be on
the safe side make sure I find the right
one I'm going to start by looking at the
start position i'm going to start the
find from the initial opening bracket
and so i'll find the next closing
bracket now that would find the first
tag but i'm going to have to do this
multiple times if there's more than one
tag in the string so while i have an
opening tag remember if we have the
string we're looking for not found then
it returns minus 1 so as long as we
haven't got minus 1
we're going to keep looking for the tags
and removing them now to actually remove
the tag I'm going to break the string up
i'm going to take the part before the
tag and the part afterwards and join
them together so i'm going to take the
string up to start now this will
actually exclude the opening tag because
it ends at one position less than start
i'll replace the tag with a space and
then i'll put the rest of the string
after the tag at the end and now i'll
start at one position after end because
end is the position of the closing tag
and we don't want to include that so now
I've got a new string I'm going to see
if I've got another tag that I'm going
to have to remove so I'm going to look
for the next opening tag if I find an
opening tag when it comes to the top of
the while loop if to go through again if
I don't find another opening tag the
while loop will finish in that case I
want to return the string but not just
the string I want it split into
individual words so then I'm just going
to split and that almost completes the
code except that I've missed named the
procedure and called it removed tag
instead of removed tanks and now we're
done</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
