one year as 10,000 times 1 plus 0 point
0 3 here we can clearly see those two
quantities you were just talking about
the principal 10,000 right here and the
interest rate 0 point 0 3 right here so
what would happen if we kept our
expressions in this form but found the
balance after year too first things
first though let's remember how we found
this quantity here we took the principal
and then since it's the amount of money
in the account at the start of this year
we multiplied it by the interest rate
that's how we got this quantity now we
know that define this balance after two
years we're going to need to start with
the amount of money that's in the
account at the beginning of your to
which is this quantity right here so
this amount is going to sneak around and
end up as our starting point now i'm
about to give you a bunch of boxes to
fill in but please don't be overwhelmed
you're very well prepared to do what I'm
about to ask you to do it's not a big
deal but I would like you to do is to
substitute into these greenboxes a
certain quantity and I'll give you a
hint the same quantity belongs in each
of these boxes think using this equation
right here what quantity that is then
based on what you end up with right here
I'd like you to write this in a more
compact form right here however keep one
plus point zero three written as is
don't change it to one point oh 3</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
