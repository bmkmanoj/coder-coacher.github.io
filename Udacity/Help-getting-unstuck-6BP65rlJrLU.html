now so what I do when I have a bug and I
and I can't quite pin down what's
causing it I make the feature that's
broken simpler so I take out complete
eight components out until I have a
working feature again and then I
gradually add them back in and then each
one that I add back in I'm tweaking to
to fix it um gosh there's a lot of
different ways to be stuck but if I'm
writing something that has a lot of
calculation and somehow it's not coming
through the way I expected sometimes
it's best just to start over but there
can be something powerful up starting
again with a blank slate rewriting
something sometimes when I get stuck in
the development process because I'm
frustrated or I just don't really I
can't see how to get from where I am to
where I want to go I find the smallest
possible thing that I know I can get
done and I just go after that and a lot
of times just closing that tiny little
gap that easy chore that had to be done
is enough to just sort of get you going
again so when I get stuck it kind of
depends on the mood or the reason a lot
of times I get stuck because i'm just
using poor debugging practices and being
lazy instead of actually dating through
the debugger and finding out what's
wrong other times if it's more of an
inspiration thing I'll just go for a
walk get out side get away from the
computer for a while and then come back
to the project so when I get stuck my
first instinct is to go to the team that
I'm working with I find that everybody
has different skills and different
expertise and leveraging that is to your
benefit so a quick hey have you seen
this before do you have a fix for it is
is always worth a try barring that i go
to google and normally it spits out
something like stackoverflow com but
sometimes it also goes to the Apple
documentation and just carefully reading
the methods that are provided to you the
properties that are provided to you and
trying to find Oh
way around the problem instead of
through the problem can often help fix
your bug</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
