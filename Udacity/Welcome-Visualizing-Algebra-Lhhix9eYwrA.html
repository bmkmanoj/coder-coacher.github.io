answers which is totally okay I think
all these are great and here's why we
know successful students make mistakes
more importantly successful students
learn from their mistakes in this course
even if you don't get a problem right on
the first time you should definitely try
again if you try the problem again
you're likely to get the correct answer
then you can also go back and write
yourself a note to remember what went
wrong the thing i want to emphasize is
that mistakes are okay you might even
find some mistakes that we made while
making the videos while we try to bring
you the best material we aren't perfect
in the first unit you'll even see my own
handwriting and drawings improve I made
a ton of mistakes while making these
videos but for me the most important
part was to reflect and learn from those
mistakes to be successful in this course
we also recommend you take notes while
watching the videos these notes can be
helpful for you to solve practice
problems and also help you review
content later it's a great idea to break
up your notes into individual lessons
that way you can remember what you
learned from each video segment third
research tells us that the most littered
occurs while working in groups students
don't succeed just by working harder or
studying longer they do better by
talking about math by discussing it by
practicing it and teaching others
usually from lecture you only remember
5% of what you hear from reading you
only remember ten percent audio and
visual 20 and demonstrations thirty
percent these are considered to be
passive ways of learning because they
don't rely on much from you too well
learn when you participate on the forums
or complete practice problems after
videos you're becoming an active learner
these are the best things you can do
throughout the course to help yourself
learn and if you've really mastered
something that means you can teach
anyone that's the best finally if you're
a half listening or losing focus just
stop take a break and come back and try
again you want to avoid guessing into
the quizzes or trying to rush to the
material one thing we know about
learning is that there's an actual
physical need for time to process new
material so give each question your full
attention and your thoughts
congratulations on completing your first
question we hope you have a better idea
about how to succeed in this course when
you're ready come join us and visualize
