database looks like we said it's a
collection of relations or tables and we
looked at a table and tuples in it the
various attributes and so on so what
kind of operations can you perform on
tables of course you can create a table
we're talking about selecting certain
information out of a table of relations
so for example i can say everybody who
is in a certain department we can read
that information out of that relation
that's what a query selection we do and
we're going to see examples of that
would return as you can select
information you can of course insert
tuples or roads you can update attribute
values that are in there you can
actually perform joint operations across
multiple tables and of course you can
delete tuples delete tables and
eventually delete a database that may be
a collection of tables you know create
delete are sort of similar to what we
have seen before for example files but
some of the things like select insert
join there's a kind of new to how you
can manipulate an access data that is
stored in a database what I do for we
said we write queries or programs to
access data that is stored in a database
and those programs or queries can
actually make use of these operations
that we're talking about so this is
saying select star means everything to
all attribute values from the employee
table that we had where the department
ID is 15 so we are saying basically tell
us give us the information about every
employee who works in department that
has ID 15 so this is an example of how I
might access information that is stored
in the relation or the table that we
just saw and this is an example of a
read query because all we're doing is
reading selected pieces of information
that is there in that table and
returning that to whoever is making this
request so actually if you're going to
run this query against the table that we
just saw you will see that the
department ID is 15 for two employees
robyn and kody so we're going to get the
tuples for robyn and kody in respond
once too but when we run this query
against the database that we have so
selection has happened because of course
we had a lot more employees now we only
selecting the ones who work in the
department with ID 15 who happened to be
these two people and these are return of
the program's of queries are written in
a language a query language we talked
about SQL before and we'll see some more
examples of that but basically these
programs or queries that we're talking
about in this language allow you to use
these basic operations that you can
perform on tables or relations and you
can use these operations in the programs
that you write or the queries that you
submit to access the data that is of
interest to you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
