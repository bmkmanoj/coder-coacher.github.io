half an hour walk from work doesn't make
me take a ferry and we're able to verify
that our pancake house gelateria school
or hospital is in the area but after a
search query turns up those results we
want to see more about those places in
our potential new neighborhood luckily
the places library is a ridiculously
large database full of useful tidbits
about the world around us place has
returned in both our auto complete and
search box have unique identifiers
called place IDs you should be aware
that you can pass them just like lat
Long's and many of the services such as
distance matrix and directions api's
place IDs are the keys that get you back
tons of details about an establishment
or location when we get the list of
results from our search box we get place
IDs for all of them let's take a look at
a few examples of using the place IDs in
the place details web service to see
what kind of details are available we
already have a place ID here to test out
we'll be getting the place IDs within
our site from our search box or text
search query but for the web service
requests we can get place IDs from the
places text nearby or radar searches
check out the link in the instructor
notes for how to do that we need to use
the place IDs to search for place
details which is the demonstration that
we're about to do again i'm specifying
that i'm doing a place detail search
here and that I want the response in
JSON format I'm passing in a place ID
and my API key here's the response that
we get back for the Google Sydney office
I'm going to minimize the address
components and the geometry okay we can
see here that we get back an
international phone number the name for
the place some photos or rating not sure
where those point five points went lots
of reviews and the type so we can tell
this is an establishment which means
it's a business all of these photos have
photo reference IDs seen here we can
build another simple URL to use the
photo reference IDs using an API
ki and a photo reference parameter and a
width this time I'm making a places
photo request again I specify it with
the photo reference ID that I got back
from the place details requests and my
API key that's the places photo that we
were given in our place details request
let's do another place ID as an example
this is a great little coffee shop you
may or may not of heard of it okay we
can see that this is the starbucks on
Broadway in the city now we can see some
pretty useful stuff operating hours are
really useful for one thing we'll use
these in our site later when we get
place details results notice that we get
back for display purposes text but also
granular data of the periods when it's
open again we get back the photos we
also again get back the rating and
reviews so for example if I wanted to
limit my results to things open for
certain hours or above a certain rating
I could do that if you're making a
restaurant reviewer sir job these things
can be really important to you let's get
back to our site so we're early getting
back all the place IDs when we do the
text search or the search box query so
let's add an on-click event on the
markers that appear that will display
some place details about each marker
remember we need the places library
loaded to do this we already included it
in order to use auto complete and search
box we're going to add to our create
markers for places function for each
place marker that we create we're going
to add an event listener to call a get
details function we're going to create a
single info window here that will share
between the different place markers that
we only have one set of place details
open at once and then we'll add our
event listener for a click event on the
marker this will call a get place
details function passing in the marker
which is this and the place info window
let's define that now our get place
details function is going to use the
place ID to execute a place detail
search and then it's going to display a
bunch of that information in an info
window above the place marker
will create a new place of service and
use the get details method passing in
the police ID which we set as the marker
ID before we'll get back the results
check that the status is ok and then
parse through all that neat data that we
saw before in the web service call we'll
put all of this data into the info
window that we create including the
first photo reference that we get
remember not every place ID will return
all of the details that we saw in the
web service calls some of them may not
have opening hours some of them may not
have a phone number etc so we have to
check for the existence of each of these
pieces of data before we actually
display it in the info window let's test
this out ok let's click on some of these
markers to get more results we can see
the place name the formatted address the
phone number the operating hours and a
nice little thumbnail Oh a 24 hour I hop
jackpot alright so I think this is
really going to help our users at this
point they'd be able to find the places
of interest in the neighborhoods that
they could potentially live in let's
review our places API skills in a quiz</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
