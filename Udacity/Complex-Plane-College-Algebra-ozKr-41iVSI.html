complex number A plus bi that complex
numbers have both a real part which
comes from the number a and an imaginary
part which comes from this part b I
remember a and B are just real numbers
here but this part b I is an imaginary
part because of the eye we can talk
about the size of a real number by
plotting it on a simple number line
because there's just a linear
progression of numbers higher in lower
than 0 because complex numbers have
these two parts though the real and the
imaginary we can't plot them in a
one-dimensional way instead we need to
plot them on a two-dimensional axis
similar to the Cartesian coordinate
plane we've been working with this will
fill is a very different purpose though
we're not graphing equations on here not
relating variables x and y to one
another we're just graphing numbers that
are written in this form what we do is
we label this horizontal axis on our
plane the real axis and we say that the
vertical axis is the imaginary axis so
for any complex number written in the
form a plus bi we can instead write it
as the point a comma B on this
coordinate plane so the horizontal
coordinate comes from the value of the
real part and the vertical coordinate
comes from the coefficient of the
imaginary part let's look at an example
so if I plot the point 4 comma 6 on our
set of axes this translates into the
complex number 4 plus 6i that's what's
being depicted by this point on this
plane let's say we want to express
negative 7 plus 2i let me go to negative
7 horizontally and then up to so on this
plane we can graph any number written in
this form</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
