channels is to think about how business
first started we first started
distributing and making physical
products cars food utilities etc and we
distributed them through direct sales
force that is people you shook hands
with looked in the eye and met and it
wasn't until the mid 20th century that
we actually started selling virtual
products things that didn't quite exist
physically like insurance stocks and
bonds enterprise software shrink-wrap
software started to be distributed
through physical channels but they
didn't exist in the real world but it
wasn't until the mid-1990s with the
emergence of the internet that we were
able to distribute physical products
through a virtual Channel think of
Amazon or Zappos or Netflix even
consumer electronics sold through the
web and what's happened in the beginning
of the 21st century is we now have
products that don't exist at all
Facebook Twitter Google they're all bits
and they're also distributed via the web
this virtual virtual distribution
channel allows for easier customization
optimization and allows you to change
both product and channel almost
on-the-fly through the rest of this
lecture we're going to show you which
channels might be optimum for your
startup and allow you to choose which
one to pick</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
