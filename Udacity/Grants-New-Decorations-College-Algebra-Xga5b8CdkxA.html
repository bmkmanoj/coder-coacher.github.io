journey building up his glasses wiper
and nozzle underpriced he's doing
algebra all the time now to solve
problems he encounters in his business
and he knows how to do all of it because
of us he's been so successful that he
was able to afford a new office and he's
trying to decorate his new place with
art that reflects his products although
he has different sculptures and
paintings and other masterpieces strong
throughout his new space one of the
things he's most excited about is this
fountain that looks like a giant wiper
nozzle he thinks he's worked out an
equation for the trajectory of the water
coming out of the fountain and then
going up falling down on the ground
however he wants us to check that
equation for him let's help him see if
it's right just like we had with grants
slingshot a few lessons ago let's set up
a coordinate plane so that the fountain
is positioned at the origin just like
this now I realize that the fountain is
not as small as a single point on the
coordinate plane but for the purpose of
this question let's just pretend like
the entire thing is located exactly at
the origin from the physician at the
origin the water is going to shoot up
out of the fountain and then fall and
end up slightly over to the right here's
the equation that grant came up with y
equals negative 7x squared plus 14x
minus 10 in this equation X stands for
the horizontal position of the water at
a given moment and y stands for the
corresponding vertical position of that
same drop of water so every drop of
water in this fountain should follow
about this equation remember this is
just an approximation or sort of
idealize in this situation so just go
with it now if grant is right then one
of the roots of this equation should be
where the fountain is located at zero
and the other two tell us where the
water lands over here in other words if
we solve the quadratic equation that
goes along with this equation for a
parabola then we should get those two
solutions those two roots let's use the
quadratic formula to see if grant is
right for now I just like you to
simplify the parts of the formula that
belong in each of these boxes just put a
number in each spot</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
