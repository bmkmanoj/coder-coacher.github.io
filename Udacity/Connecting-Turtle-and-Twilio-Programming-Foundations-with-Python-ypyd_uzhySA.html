with classes one when we drew shapes
using turtles and then the other one
when we sent out text messages using
Twilio now when we created shapes using
turtle we wrote a line of code that read
Brad is equal to turtle dot turtle now
what we're really trying to say with
this line of code here is that inside
Python there is a file called turtle and
inside that file is a class called
turtle there it is and when we try to
access that class using this statement
especially with this open closed
brackets what we are really doing behind
the scenes is calling the init function
defined inside the class and what this
function in it does is that it
initializes or creates space in memory
for a new instance which we called Brad
Brad is an object or instance of the
class turtle this instance Brad can then
do things defined inside the class
turtle like move the turtle forward
similarly when we write a line of code
that says client is equal to rest dot
Twilio rest client what we are really
trying to say is that inside Twilio
there is a folder called rest and inside
that folder is a python file which has a
class called Twilio rest client now when
we call this line of code the one where
we access the class Twilio rest client
with these open closed brackets what we
are really doing is calling a function
init defined inside that class Twilio
rest client and what this function init
does is again initializes or creates
space in memory for an object or
instance of that class to Allie rest
client we call that object client the
object client can then do things defined
inside that class Twilio rest client
like send SMS Azure texts so in
summation you can think of a class as a
blueprint of a building now this
blueprint will have certain pieces of
information about the building like the
number of rooms in the building the area
under the building etc now we can use
the same blueprint to build multiple
buildings for instance a residential
complex
yellow walls and an office building with
blue walls similarly a class let's take
the example of class turtle that we've
used thus far now this has information
about the turtle for instance how to
make the turtle move forward how to make
the turtle turn right etc now we can use
one class as a blueprint or a template
to create multiple instances like Brad
and Angie now these instances they can
do things that are defined inside our
class or blueprint things like move
forward turn right and draw a circle now
recently we've seen another class and
this class is called Twilio restclient
which I have just abbreviated here for
lack of space this class has information
about how to connect with Twilio and
send a text message and from this
blueprint we can then create an instance
called client client can then do things
that are defined inside the class like
send out texts so you can think of a
class as a blueprint which have some
basic information defined inside of them
and you can think of its objects as
examples or instances of that blueprint</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
