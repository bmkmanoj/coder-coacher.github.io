projects and while there are some
details that will change from semester
to semester there's some principles that
we anticipate staying true with long run
the first is that this project is very
open-ended you have a lot of leeway to
specify what you want to work on you
might choose to do some research you
might choose to build a tool you might
choose to investigate a current
technology you have a lot of room to
decide what you want to work on for the
project you'll propose it yourself scope
it out develop a plan and then execute
it second these projects are intended to
be real contributions to the field of
educational technology and so we want to
do as much as possible within this
semester to get them ready to take out
into the world so this class will
culminate in a paper ready for
publication in the conference or journal
most pertinent to the work you do in
this class you don't have to submit it
of course but we want to have all the
work done for you so if you'd like to
take that next step you're already ready
I'll judge the success of this class
based on the extent to which it
generates publications research programs
startup businesses or tools that we can
use here in the msds program and third
just as those projects are intended to
be real contributions that the field of
educational technology we'd like to
treat them as such ourselves so with
your permission we'd like to include
your projects in our course library to
provide the future students in this
course maybe they'll borrow from your
ideas or maybe some of them might even
pick up your project and take it to the
next step</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
