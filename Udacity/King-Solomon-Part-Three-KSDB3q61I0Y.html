don't see anything better than this but
if you think you can out Solomon Solomon
more power to you well I believe that
there is a way to out Solomon Solomon
and it really boils down to noting what
Solomon was trying to do what was
Solomon trying to do Solomon was trying
to had private knowledge of whether they
were moms or not they were just she was
just trying to get them to tell the
truth right and what he was trying to
elicit in this particular mechanism was
what their preferences were so this sort
of private notion of whether my mom are
not sort of what was happening with what
King Solomon's doing is this kind of
assumption that each mom held the baby
in sort of with some kind of value so
mom a in this case woman a in this case
loves the baby and give assigned some
kind of value or utility of having the
baby around and women be also has a
value or utility for having the baby
around versus having the baby end up
with the other woman right and in
particular there's a value of the baby
to the true mother that is higher than
the value of the baby to the fake mother
maybe in this case that better be what
King Solomon thought because otherwise
why would the fake mother be okay with
cutting the baby in half again not
necessarily okay just not as horrified
right well that means there's a lower
value there right so there's two values
that are that are actually going on and
let's say there's a value of the baby
for the real mother and there's a value
of the baby for the fake mother and
really the only thing that we have to
sort of assume here is that the value of
the baby to the real mother is greater
than the value of the baby to the figma
okay which is also not so clearly a good
assumption sure but it certainly drives
what's going on with King Solomon here
you know if value is like willingness to
pay could be that B is really rich but
isn't the mom and a is poor and can't
really pay very much but okay all right
let's just go with this so so I mean if
we want to know who wants the baby more
right who wants the baby more sort of
the intrinsic value of the baby okay to
each of the women and if you assume that
the true mother cares more about the
baby that is has the baby the higher
value than the fake mother then
you know believing this to be true is
make sense I'll take it sure and if
that's not the case in round of all stay
anyway so you might as well go ahead and
just sort of assume that this is true
anyway if the the fake mom has that much
money to buy a baby but that's what
she's trying to do no she stole the baby
oh good point okay good so let's assume
that we really believe that there's a
value to the baby through the real mom
and it's greater than the value of the
baby to the fake mom okay so i'm just
going to assert another kind of
mechanism that King Solomon main used
okay I want you to walk me through it
and see if you believe that this is good
bad or the same as what King Solomon
actually did in a star in the story okay
yeah all right so let me write that out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
