we're going to be looking at the first
two because they're the ones that give
the greatest benefit but I'll mention
also some of the others okay in
particular number one thing is state
charts offer nesting or depth okay that
is a particular state in the state chart
can be its own state machine and you can
zoom in that way secondly they offer
concurrency imagine that you have two
things going on each of which can have a
number of states recall from state
transition diagram that in order to
model that we have to multiply the
number of states state charts allow you
to treat those separately okay therefore
only getting an additive number of
states rather than a multiplicative
number of states of course once you've
done that that is separated the
concurrent machines into two parts you
still have to synchronize them that is
they still have to cooperate somehow and
stay charts offers a way of doing that
called broadcast events we'll look at
that and of course you can also use data
conditions which are globally available
to both machines will look at entry exit
actions will look at mint parameters
will look at history and of course the
default states that we've already seen
the icons for</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
