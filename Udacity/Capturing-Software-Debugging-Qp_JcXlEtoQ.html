than in the lab this makes reproduction
hard at first because you lack all the
data you might need to do efficient
debugging however having programs that
execute in the field can actually also
ease debugging the basic idea is to
exploit the many runs that are out there
in the field suppose you have a number
of runs hopefully few that fail and a
number of runs hopefully many that pass
or that don't fail what you could look
for is features of the execution that
statistically correlate with failure one
such feature could be the execution of
individual parts of the program if you
knew for instance that in all the non
failing runs a specific function is
never called whereas the same function
is always called in all the failing runs
and this information goes to you of
course the first thing you would do is
to look at the function f in order to
see what is it that could possibly go
wrong in here instead of f you could
also come up with other execution
features for instance this could be a
specific line or a specific return value
or a specific variable value all of
these features could possibly correlate
with success or failure and thus provide
important hints as it comes to the
debugging to get this to work we need to
collect these execution features and
we'll start with executed lines because
this is plain and simple coverage the
idea again is to use the tracing
function and the tracing function would
record for every single line in the file
whether it has been reached so we have
this global coverage variable and if we
reach a new line we extract the file
name and the line number and what we now
do if we do have the file name and the
line number is we check whether we've
seen the file name before and if we
haven't we create a new empty set then
we add the line number to the set we
found for this file name here again we
set the tracer and now we simply invoke
this on a simple text without HTML
markup let's see which lines are
actually covered click on run and here's
the set line
four five six eight nine and so on are
being covered in here let's go and Mark
these lines which are covered here in
the code there's line 4 5 6 8 9 11 13 15
16 and 18 the lines that are not covered
is 9 10 9 12 and line 14 that is all the
lines that would set tag to specific
values are set quote to specific values
since the result of passing some text
without HTML markup is actually correct
we could now deduce that maybe we should
come up with tests to check for these
lines which we haven't covered yet and
see whether these fail and then we could
find out that errors would actually be
related to the execution of these lines
but first let's come up with an
automatic mechanism to produce this
markup that is whether a line is
executed or not the idea is to produce
the program as output and prefix every
single line with a star if it has been
executed and with a blank if not so we
need to turn this set into the code
prefix with stars or not he is a
starting point since we already have the
file name we can actually open the file
name and read its context as an array of
lines let's see whether this works
indeed what we get is a list of the
individual lines in the program</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
