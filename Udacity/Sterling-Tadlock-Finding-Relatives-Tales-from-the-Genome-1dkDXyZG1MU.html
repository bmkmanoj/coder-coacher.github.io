sort of wanted to start with you know
where I was my deep ancestry history
where I originated from and it shows it
all around not surprisingly 20 percent
from the British Islands and then the
rest were from some unidentified
European countries but about 1% was from
Sardinia a little island off of Italy
which I find really fascinating well I
want to know like when you got the
results back when 23andme I think they
send you an email saying your results
are ready um what were you feeling as
you like when you got the results the
rather than notification and then what
what were you actually feeling in the
process I was feeling very overwhelmed
because I knew that there was a
potential for me to find out from the
relative finder section you know my
biological parents and/or biological
siblings or aunts or any relatives and
information that I never had because as
you know my adoption was closed and they
didn't release any of that information
and I felt always that I had reached a
dead end but this was a potential it
could potentially further my finding my
my biological or birth parents so I was
very anxious very overwhelmed very
nervous like clicking through everything
I even tried to like go through all the
other parts of 23andme before I got to
that just so I could sort of you know
calm myself down and then I clicked on
the relative founder okay so you opted
into the relative finder and you clicked
on it what did you see well I saw a
whole host of third to fourth cousins
quite a few from both England and
eastern North Carolina which I which was
where I was born and raised the closest
though I did find one second to cousin
it didn't come up at first and after
about a week a week of having the
original results evidently this person
didn't or 23andme was able to match our
DNA a little bit better and this person
showed up and it basically said that
they were male and that they were from
North Carolina and they shared about
0.97% of the DNA that I had and then in
the advanced tool section of 23andme
you can look at your actual chromosome
pattern and see what bands of
chromosomes match and there were quite a
few bands which led me to believe that
you know we had somewhat close no DNA
lineage Wow so did you did you reach out
to this person I did I was sort of
debating whether I would you know
contact them sort of open up the can of
worms or the Pandora's box and sort of
get this a new person involved in my
life and I reached out and basically I
said my name my age where I was from and
that I was adopted and that I would love
to know more about their background and
after about three days an email was sent
to me for this person who gave me his
name
how old he was and that he was from
Eastern North Carolina and he gave me a
bunch of surnames hypothesizing his for
grandparents last names which is a very
common name and the community I was born
and raised in so I mean this sounds like
I mean you connected but somebody who is
I mean who who you know the surnames the
family names you're familiar with I mean
I know it was it's felt like a bit of a
soap opera that I was sort of in like
becoming a part of I called my adopted
real parents I called them and you know
told the most participating in this
course as well as participating in
23andme and they were not hesitant they
were they were they were okay with it
and when I told them the list of names
are my mother pulled out all the phone
books from Eastern North Carolina
because she collects those evidently and
trying to find like this certain name
that could be in the county where she
knew that all three of the other names
were in and she was calling my aunt to
see if she knew this person and so it's
just started this sort of domino thing
where everybody's trying to be Nancy
Drew or the Hardy Boys to try to figure
out who this cousin is I'm still
debating about you know where to take
this how how involved I should get with
this person you know I I don't know how
receptive this person will be and and
it's the second cousin which you know
isn't an aunt or an uncle it's you know
still a little far out and so for me to
say I'm adopted do you know anybody that
you may be related to who had a child
put up for adoption the likelihood of
that is still low however I am hopeful
that maybe maybe they do know I'm still
debating about how to pursue this so
overall how would you describe your
emotions excited nervous happy sad my
emotions about this process are buried
I'm excited and happy for the most part
and hopeful I think those describe how
I'm feeling about this right now would
you recommend this for other people who
are adopted and are interested do you
think that it has the ability to fill
gaps in their knowledge or do you think
that it's a positive experience that you
recommend other people I think it
depends on the person I think that it
depends on where the person is and how
and their identity is being adopted you
know are they if they're interested in
curious I think this is a perfectly
legitimate out of avenue to pursue I
think that everyone who does pursue this
as an avenue for trying to find
biological relatives should enter into
it with a mindset that they may not find
anything or they might find very distant
cousins because this is all dependent on
other people opting to send their DNA
into the company with that said I think
that as you know genetics is coming to
the forefront of
everyday lives and our health more and
more people are going to opt to send
their DNA in to be sequenced and to be
analyzed and to be compared with other
individuals so I think that this is a
very hopeful enterprise for adopted
individuals</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
