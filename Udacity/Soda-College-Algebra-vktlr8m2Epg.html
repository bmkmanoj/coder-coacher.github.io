in downtown Udacity Athena happened upon
a soda machine and looked so enticing
that she decided to grab a drink all the
drinks from the soda machine cost one
dollar she put a dollar in the machine
slot pressed a button for which shrinks
she wanted and voila out came a soda she
tasted a drink and since it was so
delicious she decided to buy one for her
brother too since she was about to stop
by his house so she put another dollar
in the machine and she got a second can
of soda for him now since the price per
soda has the set value a constant of one
dollar what are two variables that we
could very easily relate to one another
with an equation that uses this constant
please pick two of these five choices
down here would you want to use level of
thirstiness amount of money Athena puts
in the machine how hard a thena presses
the button how many brothers Athena has
or how many sodas the Machine spits out
which two of these belong together along
with this constant of one dollar</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
