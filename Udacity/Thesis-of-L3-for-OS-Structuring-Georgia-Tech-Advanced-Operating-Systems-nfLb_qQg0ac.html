myths aboard microkernel based operating
system structure it goes beyond that and
it has a thesis for how operating
systems should be structured
the first principle advocated by l3 is
that the microkernel should have minimal
abstractions that includes support for
address spaces threads inter-process
communication and generating unique IDs
why do we need these abstractions in the
microkernel the argument is that these
four abstractions that I mentioned
address space threads IPC and UID are
abstractions that are needed by any
subsystem that provides a functionality
for end-users in an operating system and
therefore the principle of optimizing
the common case suggests that these
abstractions should be part of any
microkernel the second piece is coming
out of l3 microkernel experience is that
micro kernels are processor specific and
implementation in other words if you
want an efficient implementation of
microkernel you have to take advantage
of whatever the hardware is offering you
which suggests that micro kernels by the
very nature are non portable if you want
to focus on performance making a
microkernel processor
independent is essentially sacrificing
performance so if you put these two
principles together what l3 is
advocating is the right set of kernel
abstractions and process a specific
implementation if you do that then you
can build efficient processor
independent abstractions at the upper
layers all of the services that we
associate in a monolithic kernel like a
UNIX operating system such as file
system network protocols scheduling
memory
they all can be implemented in a
processor independent way on top of a
microkernel that provides the right set
of abstractions and exploits whatever
the hardware gives in terms of
capabilities to get an efficient
processor specific implementation that's
the thesis of l3 microkernel processor
specific kernel and processor
independent abstractions at higher
layers of the operating system stack</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
