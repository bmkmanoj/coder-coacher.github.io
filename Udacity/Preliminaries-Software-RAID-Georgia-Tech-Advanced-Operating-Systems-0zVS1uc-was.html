telling you about is software raid I
mentioned that hardware raid has two
problems the first problem being small
rights and we said we can get rid of a
small right problem by using log
structured file system but the hardware
RAID also has another problem and that
is it is employing multiple hardware
drives and hardware raid generally
speaking is very expensive proposition
on the other hand in a local area
network we have lots of compute power
distributed over the land and every node
on the land has associated with it at
disks so could we not use the disks that
are available on local area network for
doing exactly the same thing that we did
with hardware raid and that is stripe a
file across the disks of all the nodes
that are in the local area network so
that's the idea behind the zebra file
system that was built at UC Berkeley
which was the first one to experiment
with the software raid technology it
combines both log structured file system
and the rate technology log structured
file system in order to get rid of the
small right problem and the rate
technology to get the parallelism that
you want in a file server to be able to
read from the disks in parallel so that
you can reduce the latency for serving
client requests the idea here is that
you're going to use commodity hardware
available as nodes connected to disks on
a local area network and since lfs log
structured file system is good for
getting rid of the small red problem we
are going to employ lfs as the
technology for the file server so in
this case what we have are not data
files but we have log segments that have
to be written out to the disk in NL FS
and what we're going to do is we're
going to strike the log segment on
multiple nodes of the disks in software
and that is the rate technology so if
this is a log segment
that represents the changes made to
several different files on a particular
client node then the software raid what
it will do is take this log segment and
stripe it part one of the log segment on
this node part two on this part 3 on
this part 4 on this and the ECC that
corresponds to these four parts of the
log segments into a fifth drive that's
the idea in software read exactly
similar to the hardware raid except
software is doing this striping of the
log segment on multiple nodes available
in a local area network</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
