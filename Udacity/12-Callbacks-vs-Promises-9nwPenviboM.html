and asynchronous computations okay great
this statement is less than helpful if
your understanding of the word
asynchronous is less than certain so the
question is what is asynchronous work
asynchronous work happens at an unknown
or unpredictable time normally code is
synchronous one statement executes like
this one and there's a guarantee that
the next statement executes immediately
afterwards threading on processors
doesn't necessarily guarantee that
however the JavaScript threading model
ensures that for all intents and
purposes JavaScript runs in a single
timeline
unlike synchronous code a synchronous
code is not guaranteed to execute in a
single unbroken time line in fact you
should assume that you have no idea when
asynchronous operations will complete in
a situation like this for example
you can't even assume that just because
you send out the first request first and
the second request second that the first
request will return sooner than a second
assume that either order is equally
likely as the fact that one or both
requests just might fail altogether
Network requests aren't the only
examples of asynchronous code any code
that relies on processes like these like
events like threads or just some kind of
unknowable finishing time are
asynchronous so the big question is what
is the best way to handle asynchronous
code hmm okay the answer is obviously
promises duh that's why you're here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
