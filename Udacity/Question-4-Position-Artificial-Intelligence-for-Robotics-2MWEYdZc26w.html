equations for the position of our robot
so let's start with the center
coordinates of our circle because our
robot is undergoing circular motion and
we can look at the XY coordinates of our
robot before the motion now the question
is given these XY coordinates and the
robot's orientation angle theta how can
we find CX and CY well we just define a
right triangle and we see that if this
angle is Theta we can show this angle
must also be theta this length is R so
that means this horizontal distance is R
times the sine of theta and the vertical
distance is R times the cosine of theta
that means that CX is just equal to the
initial x position minus this extra
distance R times the sine of theta and
CY is equal to the initial Y position
plus this extra distance R times the
cosine theta okay
now let's let our car advance by some
turning angle beta now this angle is
beta and here's our robot car let's call
these coordinates X prime Y prime how
can I get an equation for x prime and y
prime well we can see that this total
angle here is equal to beta plus theta
and just as we defined a right triangle
before we can define another right
triangle where this line is going to be
R times the sine of beta plus theta and
this line will be R times the cosine of
beta plus theta so working from our
center point X prime is going to be
equal to CX plus this extra distance
which is R times the sine of beta plus
theta and the y prime we can see will be
CY - the extra distance of r times the
cosine of beta plus theta theta prime of
course will just be equal to our old
theta plus the turning angle and we
can't forget to make that mud
two pi good work</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
