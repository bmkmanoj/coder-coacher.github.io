software system means defining the
requirements for the system and if you
have ever done anything like that for
example we did it for the first project
in the previous mini course you will
know that it is an extremely hard task
identifying the purpose of the software
and defining its requirements is very
very hard why is it so hard first of all
the purpose of most systems is
inherently extremely complex so this has
to do with the sheer complexity of the
purpose of the requirements just think
of how complex is the functionality
provided by most systems second it is
hard very hard to extract from humans
this purpose and make it explicit so
paraphrasing a famous quote from the
late Steve Jobs often people don't know
what they want until you show it to them
it's hard to figure out what people
really want third requirements often
change over time customers change their
mind designing and building a system
raises new requirements so for many
reasons requirements tend not to be
stable tend to evolve and that of course
makes it harder to collect them finally
for any realistic system there are many
stakeholders and they often have
conflicting goals and requirements and
it can be very hard to reconcile the
possibly conflicting requirements that
might emerge in these cases so for all
these reasons it is very very difficult
to perform requirements engineering in
an effective way</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
