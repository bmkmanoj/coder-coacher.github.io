that we're going to look at is just like
principal components analysis except
it's called independent components
analysis okay and the major difference
is really the difference between the
first word principal and independent so
the main idea here is that PCA is about
finding correlation and the way it does
that is by maximizing variance and what
that gives you is the ability to do
reconstruction what independent
components analysis is doing often
called ICA by those in the know is it's
trying to maximize independence very
simply put it tries to find a linear
transformation of your feature space
into a new feature space such that each
of the individual new features are
mutually independent and I mean that in
a statistical sense so you're converting
your X I your x1 your X to your X I dot
into some new feature space let's call
it I don't know let's call it a Y y1 y2
y I dot dot such that each one of the
new features are statistically
independent of one another that is to
say they're mutual information is equal
to 0 does that make sense and this is
going to be a linear transformation it's
going to be a linear transformation to
make them statistically independent
so I find some linear transformation
here which is going to take my original
feature space which I'm representing
with these X's and transform it into a
new feature space such that if I were to
treat each of these new features as
random variables and compute their
mutual information I would get for all
pairs of mutual information of 0 that's
part one and the second thing that it's
trying to do is its trying to make
certain that the mutual information
between all of the features Y and the
original feature space X is as high as
possible so in other words we want to be
able to reconstruct the data we want to
be able to predict an X from a Y or Y
from an X while at the same time making
certain that each of the new dimensions
is in fact mutually independent in a
statistical sense I think I'm going to
need an example</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
