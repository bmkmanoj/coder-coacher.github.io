sense to you so to me this story does
make sense I can imagine it as a story
where Ali and Sarah are co-workers and
sarah has some kind of authority over
Ali Al he's looking around the store and
saying that there aren't really many
customers right now so maybe now is a
good time to take my lunch but if
there's about to be a rush of customers
and now is not a good time because it
leaves Sarah there by herself Sully asks
Sarah do you think they're going to be
many customers in the next half hour
Sarah knows it's around lunchtime and
Sarah calls maybe the Ellie had
commented about missing breakfast this
morning so she can infer all these
motivation behind asking if there's
gonna be many customers and she says
kind of anticipates the question you
really i was asking and says yeah go
ahead and take your lunch so yeah i can
find a way for this story to make sense
even though it doesn't seem like a clear
connection between the two sentences
that's good David clearly you have an
active imagination notice how they will
introduce lots of inferences here which
were not really part of the input how
did you do it this is common sense
reasoning how did he info this probably
is lunchtime and I'll he wants to have
lunch order sarah has some kind of
authority over Ali we have come across
stories like this earlier here is
another example Asher corner to become
rich he got a gun two sentences and you
can i'm sure understand immediately what
might be going on you may surmise that
Ashoka as a professor is unlikely to
become rich even if he teaches this
online masters course on the other hand
you may have some stereotypical story
about how some people become rich well
they rob banks and the robbing a bank
may require guns and so now you can
relate a show getting a gun to trying to
become rich so you and I as human beings
have little difficulty in understanding
stories like this we might be given two
sentences like this and we can connect
them causally connect them coherently
connect them even if sometimes we use
very active imaginations to do so how
can we do this conjoining of sentences
into a coherent story put another way
how can we make an AI agent to it what
kind of knowledge to the air agent have
and what kind of inferences must it make
in order to be able to connect these two
sentences</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
