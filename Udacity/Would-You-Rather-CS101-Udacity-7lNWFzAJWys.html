Python program you might be wondering
why we need to invent new languages like
Python to program computers and fend all
the effort into learning a new language
rather than using some language like
English or Mandarin that we already know
and there are lots of reasons for that
that natural languages like English or
Mandarin are great for people who grew
up speaking them for day-to-day
conversation but there are many reasons
that they wouldn't work well for
programming computers the first one is
ambiguity natural languages are
inherently ambiguous different people
can interpret the same sentence to mean
many different things when we program
computers the computer needs to
interpret that program and we want to
make sure that the computer interprets
the program the exact same way that the
programmer who wrote the program intends
for it to be interpreted so here's an
example of the kinds of ambiguities that
come up in natural languages like
English and we'll do this in the form of
a quiz so the question is would you
rather be paid a hundred dollars weekly
or bi-weekly so these are the choices
you could prefer to be paid a hundred
dollars weekly you could prefer to be
paid a hundred dollars bi-weekly it
depends or you're an altruist and you
don't like to be paid at all</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
