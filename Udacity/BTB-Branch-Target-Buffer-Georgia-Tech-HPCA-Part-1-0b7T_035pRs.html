history is called the branch target
buffer what it does is it takes the
current PC of the branch and uses that
to index into a table which we call the
BTB
and from this table what we read out is
our best guess for what the next PC will
be but how do we know what to put in
this table
well we carry the PC of the branch and
the predicted PC with it through the
pipeline so this is what happens at
fetch later on in the pipeline we have
the correct PC new at that point we will
compare the predicted one with the
correct one and if they are not equal we
will treat that as a misprediction and
also we will use the branch's own PC to
index again into the BTB and write this
new PC that is correct into the table so
that next time we see this branch we get
the correct prediction assuming that
it's jumping to the same location but
there is a problem with our BTB how big
does it needs to be we want it to in one
cycle given the current PC predict a PC
so it needs to have a single cycle
latency that means we want it to be
really small however it needs to contain
an entire instruction address let's say
we're using 64-bit addressing that means
each entry is 8 bytes and we need one
entry for each possible PC from which we
can fetch the program can be large
note that an instruction can be 4 bytes
yet we need 8 bytes in the BTB
so really the BTB needs to be as large
as the program itself which is really
large so we cannot have a dedicated
entry in the BTB for every possible PC
address we need the BTB to be much
smaller than that how do we do that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
