it doesn't all fit on one page so people
have to break it up into chunks just
like a book is broken up into chapters
or the body of human knowledge is broken
up into many books in computer science a
module is a repository or a library of
code functions and data that do useful
things in python import brings in a
module turns out that there's already a
bunch of functions related to regular
expressions we won't have to reinvent
the wheel we can just import them into
our own Python programs and get their
benefits for free
pythons regular expression module is
called imaginatively enough our e
regular expressions so at the beginning
of a Python program just write import
space re and then you'll have access to
all of the regular expression functions
and I'm going to show them to you in
just a minute if we're going to write
down regular expressions in Python we
need to know what they look like Python
regular expressions look just like
strings they start with double quotes or
single quotes they have contents except
that two separate regular expressions
from strings regular expressions begin
with a lowercase R outside of the double
quotes so up here this is a 0 1 2 3 4 a
5 character string 0 through 9 this one
down here that begins with an R is a
regular expression that matches 10
different 1 letter strings writing
regular expressions is a creative
process you the programmer have to do it
and I'm using creative here in the same
way that people often describe
mathematics as elegant just as there are
many different equations that could get
you the number 4 2 + 2 1 + 3 8 / to
absolute value square root of 16 in fact
an infinite number they're often an
infinite number of regular expressions
that could serve a purpose picking the
right one the small one the simple one
the concise one the elegant one requires
creativity it's a skill and it's
something you'll learn in this class
let's say you've written a regular
expression though like this one now we
need to use it one of the most common
functions involving regular expressions
is find all it takes a regular
expression and a string and returns a
list of all of the sub strings that
match that regular expression so here if
we're looking for
single letter strings that are between
zero and nine the one matches the plus
does not the two matches the equals does
not the equals does not in the three
matches the return value of re dot find
all is a list one two three of all of
the sub strings that match the regular
expression list could be empty if you
didn't actually match anything this re
means it comes from the regular
expression library we really need that
import statement at the beginning for
this to work in this example I'm using
the same haystack string one plus two
equals equals three but I'm using a
different regular expression this one
only matches two single letter strings
so we'll get out one two these two match
the three does not because it's not
between one and two it's not specified
or matched by this regular expression
this last example is a little more
tricky we're looking for the letters A
through C but if you look carefully
these are the lowercase letters A and C
so even though this B is very tempting
this capital B in Barbara it's not
between lowercase a and lowercase C so
we'll match this a be a a and then
there's nothing over here in Liskov
Barbara Liskov is a well known computer
scientist famous for her work in
object-oriented programming and systems
programming among other things she
invented the language clue which I'm
showing here with a bit of a magnifying
lens
she received the Turing award the
highest honor in computer science</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
