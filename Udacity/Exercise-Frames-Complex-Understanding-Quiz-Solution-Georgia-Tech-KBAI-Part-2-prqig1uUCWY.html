the way I did it is I started off by
writing down what I need to expect about
an earthquake
I needed earthquakes happen on a
particular day they happen in particular
location they caused a certain amount of
damage a certain number of fatalities
they happen on a certain fault line with
certain magnitude they occur at a
certain time there are different types
of earthquakes and they all have a
certain duration to them I then went to
the story to try and find the fillers
for the slots I'd just written down so
the time was today the location was
lower Slovakia and so on some slots
didn't have fillers in the story but
that's alright that's good David
let us note a couple of things in
David's answer first these slots are
part of David's background knowledge
about still Oh typical
earthquakes second these fillers for
these slots are coming from the story
this is a very good example of how both
bottom-up processing and top-down
processing getting combined as the story
came they would notice the word
earthquake went into a long-term memory
from a semantic memory he pulled out the
frame for the earthquake which told him
what slots look for and then he used
what am i processing to try to figure
out what values to put in there but note
the limitation of this combination are
top-down and bottom-up processing also
imagine a different story here is a
second story if you read the second
story and copy the first one you begin
to see there lots of subtle and nuanced
meanings here so killed here with her
for the 25 proposals killing here refer
to 25 people Sadie Hawkins here was a
science advisors Sadie Hawkins here was
the name of a fault
the frame knowledge representation off
itself and by itself doesn't tell us how
to pick Sadie Hawkins as a science
advisor and not as a fault or whether
the killing or 25 proposal how does it
relate with killing or 25 people we will
return to this topic and we'll talk more
about it when we come to understanding
and common sense reasoning in a few
weeks or if you're interested in reading
more about this now you can go ahead and
go watch those lessons</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
