if it does better than the bad string
hash function we defined earlier we're
going to use the same test hash function
we defined before that takes a function
as input so we can pass in either the
original bad string hash function or the
new hash string function that we hope
will work better a list of keys and the
size computing the hash value for each
key and records how many end up in each
position so let's try that again we'll
use the same example we had before using
the words from Sherlock Holmes and so
we'll initialize words as all the words
in the page that is the adventures of
sherlock holmes that we load from the
web so first we'll try this again with
the old hash function the bad string
hash and obtain the counts and let's
print those out remember what those look
like so it's a pretty bad distribution
as we saw before ranging from 725 all
the way up to over 2,000 in one bucket
now let's try it with the new hash
function instead of bad hash string will
pass in play and half string we're using
the same words the same number of
buckets and we'll see the distribution
now looks a lot better right there's no
values under a thousand now there's no
values over the highest one would be
1363 in the first bucket so let's look
like that graphically here's what we had
before with a bad hash string function
we can see the size of the buckets
varies a great deal and we have the red
and blue bar sewing some that are two
popular some that are not popular enough
with the new hash function we have much
less variance still not perfect we'd
like to have all the bars really be as
close to the same as possible but it's
really close so this is working pretty
well the other thing we can try is
having more buckets so let's try this
now we're doing the same thing but this
time with 100 buckets instead of 12
buckets and we can print that out and so
we see the results when we have 100
buckets are pretty good but certainly
not perfect we have buckets as small as
this one that has 104 and as large as
this one that has 197 so almost twice
the size of the smallest bucket it's
certainly a hard problem to build a
better hash function people put a lot of
into building good hash functions as
your tables get larger it's very
important to both have the hash function
be efficient our hash string function is
not that great because it does take a
long time to execute if the string gets
longer we have to go through that loop
once for each character and so there are
better hash functions available we're
not going to look at those in more
detail now but there'll be some links on
the website to documents about more
interesting hash functions this is going
to work well enough for us though so
before we go on to actually implementing
in the hash table i'm going to have one
quiz to make sure that you understand
why this is so much better than the
original index</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
