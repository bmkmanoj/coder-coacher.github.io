this look like so I think we're still
working with this check out method but
now we're specifying a post condition of
the method so the signature is still
patron check out a loan herbal item as
an argument and the implied argument of
the patron but the post condition is
what we're worried up okay and that
raises an interesting interesting point
so we just had an example where we were
expressing some of the properties of the
checkout process this case having to do
with kids okay in fact you could have
any number of constraints about a
particular class or particular operation
and what's going what's got what they
mean is it's as if you were ending all
those together okay so this must be true
and this must be true and this must be
true well the thing about the kids must
be true but it's only going to be true
about kids all right so it makes sense
that you can what the designers of OC l
have done is they simplify the syntax by
saying you don't have to do all those
ands if we just have the constraints
listed there we can focus on the ones
that we want to focus on so yes in this
case the signature is going to be
exactly the same as what it was before
so how would we express or could we
express multiple pre and post conditions
there like a operation to string some
together if we had multiple pre-k or
well we need to make multiple
constraints statements for the same
method so you can do it you can roll
your own okay so let's say we had three
preconditions okay you could have them
all in the same constraint with Anne's
between them okay or you could have
three constraints each with one
precondition okay you get it getting the
same thing out of it the same thing on
the postcondition side of things and
likewise an invariant is something that
must hold true if you have five
invariants they all must hold true since
if you have Anne's between them okay
okay so that was that was the context
and the signature for checked out in
this case</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
