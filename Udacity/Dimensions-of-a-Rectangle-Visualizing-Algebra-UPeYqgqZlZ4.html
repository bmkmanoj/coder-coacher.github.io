long and the width is 9 units great work
if you found these two numbers the key
to this problem is that the diagonal is
15 inches long the diagonal rectangle
cuts from one corner to an opposite
corner so we can draw in this line and
consider this to be one of the diagonals
this line would be the other diagonal
but we only need one triangle in order
to figure out the side lengths of our
rectangle we know the diagonal is 15
inches long so we can label this with 15
will let the width of the rectangle be X
since we know the length is 3 inches
longer than the width this means that
the link must be X plus 3 here again is
another case we're using algebra to
relate to things we have one unknown
which is the width and related in it to
the length since the length is 3 inches
longer than the width now we have a
right triangle and we're ready to use
the Pythagorean theorem to solve for x
we'll square each of the legs which is
this side and this side and we know if
we sum those squares together we'll get
the square the hypotenuse or 15 squared
will combine these like terms together
to get 2x squared plus 6x plus 9 equals
225 next we'll subtract 225 from both
sides so we'll have this quadratic
expression set equal to 0 these terms
are all even so we can divide our
equation through by two this gives us x
squared plus 3x minus 180 equals 0 we
find factors of negative 108 that sum to
positive 3 those factors are negative 9
and positive 12 so we can write these
two factors and then set each one equal
to 0 to solve for x so x can equal
positive 9 or X can equal negative 12 a
negative side lengths wouldn't make
sense in this case so we'll let x equal
9 here so if the width is nine then we
know that the length must be three more
than the width or this would be 12 units
again great algebra thinking if you got
these two numbers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
