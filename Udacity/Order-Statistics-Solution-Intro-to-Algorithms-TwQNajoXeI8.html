collection of names here I had to
include Michael you know because it is a
relevant name to me but in fact and in
1995 it was the most popular name given
in the u.s. more popular than any of the
names given to any of the women in fact
Matthew was the second highest male name
but I didn't ask for male names I asked
for female names the most popular female
name given was Jessica and that I think
that was actually most popular for a
good solid decade or two that's been
very popular for a very long time as has
Michael been decades and decades and
decades is no longer the most popular
given name but it was for a long time
the second most popular female name was
Ashley Susanoo and Taylor were among the
well zuzana was among the least popular
and Taylor was pretty popular and pretty
distinctive to that year but not the
second most popular in that year</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
