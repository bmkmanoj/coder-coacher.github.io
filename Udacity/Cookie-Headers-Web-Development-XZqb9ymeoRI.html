are sent in HTTP headers so when a
server in an HTTP response wants to give
you a cookie wants to assign a cookie to
your browser it uses a header that looks
something like this the header name is
set - cookie like all headers it's
followed by colon and in the space and
then the value of the header and in this
particular case you say name equals
value there are some other parameters
you can have on the cookie that we'll
discuss later but basically they use the
set cookie header just to set cookie
named user ID to this value and remember
this is the value and this is the name
and the value can be you know up to 4k
honestly I don't know if there's a limit
to how big the name can be generally
this is very very short
if the server wants to set send multiple
cookies it can do so by using multiple
set cookie cookie headers there's no
restriction that says headers have to be
unique a server can send as many cookies
as it wants it's up to the browser to
decide whether or not the store then
remember I said about 20 is the max so
try to try to keep it under there now
when a this is in the response now in
future requests the browser sends its
own header but this is the the name of
the header and remember this is you know
this is also the name of the header over
here is set cookie and then the value of
the header in this case is user ID
equals one two three four five again we
have the the name of the cookie and the
value of the cookie if we were to make
this H this request match what these two
cookies were this when the browser sends
multiple cookies that looks something
like this user ID goes one two three
four five semicolon which separates each
cookie from each other and then any
other cookies so the browser sends one
cookie header with all of your cookies
in it the semicolon is important and you
may be wondering well what if I want to
put a semicolon in my cookie value and
the short answer is don't and if you
really want to encode the cookie value
you know you this this can be whatever
you want the browser doesn't care so you
can you can base64 it you can encrypt it
you can wrap 13 it you can do whatever
you want here but make sure you escape
those semicolons so you don't goof up
your the incoming cookie header some
frameworks will do this for you we are
going to be operating at a lower level
so that's something you'll want to think
