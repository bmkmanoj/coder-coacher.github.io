pizza app dorm room Debbie we know all
about her attributes and we understand
her use cases so in a minute we're gonna
talk about how we can build feature
lists that are perfect for Debbie yeah
before we do that though let's address
the elephant in the room we actually
didn't have an elephant so we got this
thing instead the abominable snowman
yeah so where did these persona
attributes and use cases come from how
do we validate that their representative
actual users in the real world well the
way we do that is there's an entire
field called UX research which does just
that there are folks that go out in the
world and they use a variety of tools
like interviewing people observing their
behavior they have things like
ethnography and they figure out what
people do what tasks they want to to
perform with technology in their daily
lives and what they expect from this
technology exactly so they give us all
the data to help us build really
informed personas and use cases so we
know that our designs are gonna be
really accurate yeah and we're gonna see
a video just now from rich that talks
about UX research and why it's important
and how it's done</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
