actually had a sense leave take home the
golden brain for detecting a difference
of under two percent that's amazing I
guess that you were proved wrong about
your human difference threshold average
of three percent
well Annie that is why they call it an
average well either way it's pretty
amazing and even more importantly I'm
okay and my breathing has stopped Annie
it was a paper cut Lauren it hurt well
I'm glad you're feeling better
thanks but this baby makes you feels a
little weird how so well I don't know
there's how these are all grooves in in
they're kind of bothering me that's your
mechanoreceptors sensing that what your
mechanoreceptors their little neurons in
your skin that are sensitive to
different things like grooves or texture
shape even vibrations in motion and each
one is sensitive to its own specific
sort of texture yeah that's really
fascinating it's almost like the rods
and cones in our eyes which we use to
any I'm going to stop you there I just
got word from Susan that they're gonna
start the brain ceremony we'll get back
to that in a minute</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
