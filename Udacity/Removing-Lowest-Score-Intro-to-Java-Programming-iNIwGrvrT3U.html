to perform more complicated tasks for
example we could calculate the final
score which is the sum of all the scores
except the lowest one this is related to
several of the algorithms that you've
just seen let's write a method to drop
the lowest score and I'll give you some
methods that you can use one removes the
score at a particular index one finds
what the minimum score is and one finds
the index of a given score skips in the
quiz and code up remove lowest if you're
pretty sure you've got this I'm gonna do
a demo on a small data set in case you
want a little more info first let's say
our set of scores was eight seven eight
point five nine point five seven four
and ten we'd also have some zeros left
over at the end of the array since it's
partially filled but current size will
tell us not to go past there I would
first find the lowest score it might be
8 but 7 is better it's not eight point
five or nine point five there's 7 again
ok 4 is better not 10
okay so 4 was the lowest we saw now I
want to find the index of that element
so I'll go through again this time
looking for the number 4 and remembering
the index and it looks like I found it
the index I want is 5 now I remove the
5th element which will move 10 down and
I'll need to decrease current size you
won't actually have to implement remove
but now you can see why it might be
important when you're calculating the
sum to only look at the items that you
know are in the array because this 10
will show up in two places now and you
wouldn't want to add 10 to the sum twice
if you already have methods to remove
and to find a minimum element and to
find the location of a given element how
would you code remove lowest</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
