viewcontroller we can write this code we
need to investigate our class you will
notice that it inherits from another
class called uiviewcontroller which is a
class apple wrote for managing views let
me unpack this relationship with the
help of a diagram so we know that the
view in our app comprises of things like
buttons and labels and that this view is
controlled or managed by a file called
viewcontroller.swift
now this file has a class in it by the
same name and this class inherits from
uiviewcontroller uiviewcontroller has
several functions defined within it that
we also inherit one of them is called
viewdidload this is called when our view
is first created this function is great
for any initial setup or any
one-time-only work that we want to do in
our app by the way if you go back to the
code you will notice that there is a
skeletal version of this method
viewdidload which was created when we
first made our project another function
we inherit is called viewwillappear
this function is called right before the
view appears to the user and it's a
great place for showing and hiding
different things on our screen next on
the list is view did appear this
function is called right after the view
appears to the user and is a great place
for starting any animations there are a
few more functions like these two of
them our view will disappear and view
did disappear I've added a link in the
instructor notes that provides more
details about all of these by the way
don't take my word for the existence of
any of these functions let's go back to
Xcode and check for documentation here I
can press and hold the option key on my
keyboard and then click on
uiviewcontroller to get some
documentation on this class if you
actually want to see the code inside
this class uiviewcontroller what you can
do is press and hold command on your
keyboard and then click on the class
name Xcode will now show you the code
inside uiviewcontroller here you can
check to see all of the methods inside
uiviewcontroller like viewdidload
viewwillappear and the rest once you're
done reading through this code you can
go back to your own class by clicking
this back button here okay so here I am
at the question I asked previous
now that we know a little bit more about
these functions that run at different
times in the life of a view let's think
about this question one more time if you
wanted to write this piece of code to
hide the stop button which method would
you write this in</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
