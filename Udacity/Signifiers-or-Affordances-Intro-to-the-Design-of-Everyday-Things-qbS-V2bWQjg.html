emphasize the affordances and signifiers
are quite different concepts they're
independent affordances are the possible
actions an actor can take apply to an
item in question signifiers are the
signal signal conveyed to the person
about the possible actions something can
be an affordance or a signifier or both
or neither it could even be a signifier
of something but not afford doing it the
correct answers to the questions
therefore are the barbwire
yeah the barbs on the barbed wire
they're both signifiers and anti
affordances the danger sign yeah that's
a signifier the size of the high voltage
line well that's a signifier to some
people but meaningless to others and the
very high voltage itself is an invisible
affordance it doesn't afford getting
here you'll kill yourself because within
width for a high voltage of you're
within one meter about three feet it can
be fatal but there's nothing to see it's
invisible so the very high voltage is
actually an invisible anti affordance
the doorknob it's a partial signifier
and an affordance the signifier is only
partial because it indicates where to do
the action you know pushing or pulling
or turning but not which action to do</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
