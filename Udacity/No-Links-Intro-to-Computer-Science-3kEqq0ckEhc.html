procedure and we know how to use it by
using multiple assignment to get the two
results there's one serious problem with
the get next target procedure that we
have to fix before we go on to the
problem of outputting all the links in
the page so the problem is we didn't
really think very carefully about what
should happen if the input does not have
another link so let's try and see what
actually happens the way we've defined
it so here's the code we have forget
next target and we're going to try an
example first we'll try an example where
there is a link so what we should get as
the next target when this is the page
that's passed in is the link that's
included which is between the double
quotes inside the a href tag so when we
run that we get our two outputs we got
the string that's the link and we got 37
which is the position of the end quote
and we can see it's printing out the two
outputs as a tuple meaning the first one
comma the second one surrounded by
parentheses and we could get those in an
assignment like this instead of just
printing it will use our double
assignment getting those outputs and
we'll print the value of just the URL
and we get this string HTTP colon
Udacity comm so that worked well now
what happens if instead of passing in a
page that actually has a link we pass in
something that doesn't so let's say our
page is just the text good now there's
no link to find but the code is going to
run anyway and what we see as a result
is we actually got the result gooo
probably not what we wanted and the
reason we got the result goo is if you
remember the find command if it does not
find what it's looking for it returns
negative one and when we use negative
one as an index that means the last
character of the string so what we end
up with is getting all the characters
except for the last character if we pass
in something else that does have a
double quote in it so now we'll pass in
not good at all we see what we get back
for the URL is not so this is not very
useful this is pretty confusing behavior
it's going to be very hard to tell when
we got to the last target because maybe
not could be a valid URL and we don't
know that so what we want to do is make
get next target return something more
useful in the case where the input does
not contain any link and the way we're
going to do that
we'll leave partly up to you but I'll
give you a hint to get started so we're
gonna want to change the code and you're
gonna want to put something in to the
code here if we found a link well we got
a value for start link that's the
position of the start link if we didn't
find a link what we got back from find
was negative one and I want you to
change what the get next target
procedure does so when there's no link
to find what we should return is the
value none this is the special value
that means there isn't anything and
we'll return zero as the end pause so
let me write that out more precisely but
the hint is you're gonna have to change
the code after you've found the start
link to figure out whether there is a
link to find so your goal for this quiz
is to modify the get next target
procedure that we've defined so that if
there is a link it behaves exactly as it
does now still returns the URL of the
link target as well as the number of
that position where the end quote is but
if there's no link in the input string
it should output none as the first
output and zero is the second output and
none as a special value that means it's
not actually returning anything</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
