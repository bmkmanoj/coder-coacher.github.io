coordinates so here I wrote it instead
of with W but with s's right so the it's
full homogeneous coordinate system which
will go from the homogeneous XY 1/2
through a linear operation to a scaled
version of the new X prime Y prime all
right so the full transformation is
referred to as a general projective
transformation or a homography and a
homography still maps lines two lines
because remember we talked about
perspective transforms always maintain
lines and things that are inside of each
other stay inside of each other but this
is what's typically sometimes referred
to as perspective transform right so the
idea is if I had a plane and I was very
close to you and I tilted it this way
and we'll do more of this later the the
edge that's near you will seem longer
that the edge that's are farther away
from you and we'll prove later that a
the transformation of a plane can be
represented this way now of course
because this is a homogeneous transform
I can scale everything by a constant it
has no impact so I can make this last
degree of freedom be a 1 right and I'll
get a slightly different W but it
doesn't matter because I'm going to vide
everything through by W anyway so that
eight degrees of freedom that's the full
Hammad it's referred to as the
homography</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
