instructions but those instructions have
to be precise and detailed for example
if you ask the computer to sort your
files without giving much detail it
won't know which files you want to sort
or whether you want to sort them by name
or date or size there's a lot of
unanswered questions in this command
here a more precise list of instructions
would be to tell the computer step by
step exactly what to do open this
particular folder go through all the
files in it find the most recent one and
then place it at the top and repeat that
for the remaining files this list of
instructions here answers all possible
questions that a computer may have and
so it would happily follow them without
any problems
so those list of instructions here
should be told to the computer in a
language it understands like Java Java
language is a computer language that
uses basic English words but in a very
specific way that computers can
understand it offers a huge library of
instructions and commands that you could
just use straight away like this one for
example which you'd probably use a lot
in this course this command here
instructs the computer to display
something on the screen like a text
message or the result of a calculation
or a decision that the computer just
made it's written as follows system dot
out dot print line showed into print
line' followed by those set of
parentheses here and then terminated
with this semicolon at the end this is a
computer system command that displays
some text as an output by printing it to
the screen as a new line but what does
it print exactly anything you write
within those set of parentheses here so
say we want to print out this message
hello world then that's what we write in
there so once you run this command the
message hello world would be displayed
sounds simple enough however there's a
few things that we need to take extra
care when we're writing Java programs
let's have a look at a few first of all
it's important to know that Java is
case-sensitive which means that capital
letters and small letters matter so if
we try to write this command like this
system dot out dot print line
just exactly the same but with a small s
then Java won't really understand what
we're saying and it won't be able to run
that command also notice that I've used
those quotation marks here that's
because we want to display this message
helloworld exactly as we typed it in we
will see other options later on finally
this little semicolon at the end here
tells the computer that this is the end
of this instruction anything else I type
after that is the beginning of a new
instruction this is really handy when we
get to more complicated instructions
that can be written in multiple lines
now why don't you go ahead and try this
yourself after this video you can edit
this statement here and run your own
program try to change this message here
to display Java rocks instead of hello
world</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
