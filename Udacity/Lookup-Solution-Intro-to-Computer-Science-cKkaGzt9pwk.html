lookup so we're going to take the table
and the key and the first step is to
find the bucket so we'll use the hash
table get bucket that we defined earlier
for that and store it in a variable
called bucket so we'll use hash table
get bucket to look up in the hash table
where that key would occur and we'll
store that in the bucket but now to do
the lookup we need to go through all the
entries in that bucket find one that
matches the key to do the lookup we need
to go through all the entries in the
bucket so we'll use a for loop for that
going through the entries for each entry
we need to check whether the key part of
that entry matches the key and remember
a bucket was a list of entries and each
entry in the bucket was a keyword and
the value in the case for our web
crawler the value was a list of URLs so
if the entry matches the key so the
first part of entry is the keyword if
that matches the key we're looking for
then what we want to do is return the
value so that's the result of entry
position 1 if it doesn't match well then
we want to keep going keep trying the
next we're going to keep going through
this for loop checking all the entries
in the bucket when we get to the end we
didn't find it and what we said and the
question was if it's not in the table
what we should do is output none so now
we'll return the value none so let's try
that in the Python interpreter so here's
the code we're defining hash table
lookup we find the bucket we loop
through all the entries in the bucket if
we find one where the key matches we
return the value associated with that
key otherwise we return none when we got
to the end of the bucket without finding
entry we know it couldn't exist anywhere
else in the hash table because the only
place that keyword could appear is in
this bucket we still have all the same
code from before that makes the hash
table that gets the bucket and that adds
to the table and we'll test it using
some of the code we wrote before we're
going to add several words to our hash
table and let's try looking up a keyword
will look up Udacity and we get the
value 23 which is what we expect that's
the value that we associated with
Udacity so this is looking pretty good
we've got our hash table almost working
the one problem is the one we mentioned
before if we try to change the value
associated with Udacity and we're going
to need to do this for our web index
right when we add all
urls to the table we need to keep adding
to our URLs we don't want to lose the
one we have but we want to change the
value associated with that key word now
we do the look up again and we get the
same result and the reason we got the
same result please look at the bucket
and hash table that's associated with
the keyword Udacity well what we see is
it's a list of two elements and because
of the way we implement it add the newer
one is later in that list because of the
way we defined look up it's always going
to find the first one that matches it's
going through the entries in order the
first one that matches it returns that
value so that's why we get the value 23
so we're really almost done but we have
to make one other change we want to
change add to be more like update so
instead of adding a new entry we want to
update the value that's associated with
that entry</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
