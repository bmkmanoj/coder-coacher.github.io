its projects I can't really teach you
design you have to learn it by doing it
yourself the best I can do is to
introduce you to some specific
techniques such as modeling and
technologies such as UML that you can
use in thinking about how to solve
design problems the learning experience
comes from applying them to a problem
and getting a feel for how they work a
course on software design faces an
important challenge interesting design
typically occurs when confronting large
complex problems but those can't be
dealt with within the constraints of a
single course I have taken a different
approach to structuring projects called
design studies the idea here comes from
the world of building architecture in
which the architect often constructs a
variety of small scale models in order
to explore a design space for each of
the projects in this course I ask you to
solve it several different ways and then
to systematically study the differences
the projects themselves are relatively
small and although some coding is
involved you'll be working on teams with
enough members that you should have
enough resources to get the job done and
then study the variations I have also
tried to make the project similar to
those in the real world
the first similarity is that you will be
working with team members that you are
not co-located with you will have to
learn to quickly organize yourself to
work in a parallel distributed fashion
the second similarity is that the
projects are somewhat open-ended that is
although there are basic requirements
there is room for you to be creative in
your solutions and to go beyond those
requirements if you believe you can
significantly add value to the product
you are producing of course the danger
with an open-ended project is you might
get engaged in polishing an extension
and not have a working solution to the
basic problem I strongly suggest that
you tackle these projects in an
incremental manner that is begin by
producing a trivial working program
providing only minimal functionality
then add one new feature at a time
ensuring that the older functionality
still works
the third similarity to the real world
is that the projects are phased what
this means is that the three projects
all deal with the same problem domain
and each subsequent project builds on
the solutions developed in the previous
one
in fact you are specifically encouraged
to make use of code from your own or
other teams that was developed earlier
this situation is typical of the real
world where successful projects often
have long lifetimes in which the
additional features are added and
released to customers the fourth
similarity is that the members of your
project team change for each phase in
the real world turnover of teams is
common and you have to learn to work
with a variety of people one specific
benefit is that by having team members
from different teams you will have
familiarity with and access to a variety
of working solutions from which you can
choose components from previous phases
moreover managing teams in this fashion
provides a motivation for designing your
solutions in a way that they can be
reused on future projects even if you
don't know exactly what those projects
are</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
