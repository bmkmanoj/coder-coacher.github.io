and mobile games is how players interact
with them instead of using a touchscreen
players control Android TVs using remote
controls or game controllers there are
two basic types the first is a d-pad or
directional pad this is the basic style
of remote control that most Android TVs
ship with for that reason it's very
important to design for and just like
the controllers you may have used as a
kid it's important to realize that none
of these buttons are pressure-sensitive
so pressing harder won't make your car
accelerate any faster this is a game
controller of course the biggest
difference with the remote control is
the joysticks whereas you can think of
the buttons on the d-pad as basically
being on and off the joysticks of course
have a range of motion
in addition Android TV games can also be
controlled using devices connected via
the nearby connections API this lets
players use their phone or tablet as a
second screen input device this opens up
very cool options for multi-screen
gaming you can imagine that if you have
friends over to your house to play a
game you don't necessarily have to
purchase additional game controllers for
them they can simply use the phones they
already have in their pockets check out
the video in the instructor notes to
learn more let's talk a bit about
designing your control scheme first
always plan for a d-pad this control set
is the default for Android TV so at a
minimum you should at least be able to
navigate your menus this way even if
your game is best played with a game
controller make sure players can
gracefully exit it through your menus
using a d-pad that said it's best to
support both d-pads and game controllers
in your game whenever possible be
explicit about what kinds of controllers
your game works best with do this both
in your google play description and when
your game starts up a good strategy is
to detect at runtime what types of
controllers are connected and then
prompt players if they're not an ideal
type this sets expectations properly and
maximizes your chances of getting a good
rating on Google Play
it's good practice to show visual
controller instructions if you do so be
sure the images you use are free from
branding down the road it may be
possible to detect what brands of
controllers are detected at runtime and
show matching graphics for them but for
right now please use this template you
can find this image and more like it by
following the link in the instructor
notes here are three tips for designing
your control scheme start with default
controls that are in line with what
users expect
in different regions for example if you
plan to release both in Japan and the
United States make sure you set the
defaults appropriately for each region
when possible the back button should
always work as expected usually it
should navigate backward breadcrumb
style through the previous screens the
player has been on for example if the
user is playing your game and presses
back you might take them to the pause
screen if they press back again you
might take them to your games home
screen and if they press it yet again
take them all the way back to the
Android TV home screen because TV remote
controls though have a limited number of
buttons it's also appropriate to use the
back button to bring up a context menu
in your game if you choose to do so
though make it clear how to move back
from there blasts don't rely on special
buttons not all controllers have start
search or menu buttons for example you
