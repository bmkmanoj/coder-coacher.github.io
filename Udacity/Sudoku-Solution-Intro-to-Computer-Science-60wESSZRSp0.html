build a simplified Sudoku checker in
this version we're given an N by n
matrix in this case N equals 3 and we're
going to ensure that every number
appears once in every column and once in
every row so in this example the 1
appears once in this column once in this
column once in this column once in this
row once in this row and once in this
row and we can repeat that check for
every digit in the grid here's our plan
of action for solving this problem we're
going to go through each digit 1 through
n in this case 1 through 3 so we want to
start with 1 and we're going to go
through each row and column at the same
time checking to see that that digit
occurs once and only once in each row
and column so here we see 1 appears once
in the first row and the first column so
we increment our counts by 1 then we
check the second entry in the row and
the column and then the third entry at
the end of checking each entry in the
row in the column we check our count and
make sure that it equals 1 for both if
either one is not equal to 1 then this
grid is not correct otherwise if we go
through each digit and see that every
digit appears once and only once in
every row and column then this grid
satisfies our modified snow Kuh property
and we return true let's code this up so
here's the finished code for this
problem first we extract the size of the
grid by looking simply at the length of
the list P then we start with the first
digit and go through each digit checking
each row and column at the same time and
for each entry in the row in the column
we see if that entry equals our digit if
it does we increment our counts
otherwise we just move on to the next
entry once we go through that row in the
column we ensure that the row count and
the column count both are exactly 1 if
they aren't then we return false and
stop because the grant has already
violated our sodoku property otherwise
we keep going to the next row and the
column until we've gone through each row
for that digit after we are done with
that digit we move on to the next digit
we go through every digit ensuring the
Sudoku property for each digit we return
true because there was nothing wrong
with the grid so therefore it passes the
test</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
