how data is exchanged over the World
Wide Web so let's discuss that for a bet
HTTP stands for hypertext Transfer
Protocol and hails from the earlier days
of the web when computers transmitted
just basic web page information so what
is a protocol well a protocol is simply
a predefined set of rules that allows
computers to communicate and coordinate
with one another in order to complete a
task in this case that goal is to
exchange messages and/or data across the
internet well how does this
communication work client computers
talking HTTP transmitted messages
containing specific HTTP methods or
verbs that convey their intention or
request to a receiving computer or
server the server receives and
interprets the message reacts and then
sends that respond backs through the
internet to the client this is a request
and response exchange paradigm here are
some examples of the most commonly used
HTTP methods or verbs used today here's
a get get means I'd like to get or
retrieve some data from you server will
respond with okay here's your
information a post means I'd like to
create some new information a put means
I'd like to update some existing
information now
the server doesn't always have to
respond with a thumbs up maybe something
went wrong maybe it doesn't know what
you're talking about and could yield
some sort of unsatisfactory response
delete just simply means I'd like to
delete some existing information on the
server this was a quick overview of the
most commonly used HTTP verbs but you
can find the complete set linked below
typical web browsing tasks like loading
Facebook or Google comm can consist of
hundreds of HTTP requests what I'm going
to do now is use Chrome developer tools
to show you exactly what's getting
loaded into google.com when we reload
the page developer tools has a number of
useful pieces of information and in this
case we're going to click on the network
tab and I'm going to reload google.com
and we can see all the little things
that come loading into the page right
here see some of them are documents some
are images some are scripts in the same
way API exchanges can contain multiple
requests but are often an order of
magnitude smaller than loading a web
page mainly because there's so much less
data and media to load</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
