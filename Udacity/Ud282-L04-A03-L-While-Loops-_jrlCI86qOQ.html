alarm say after a hundred beeps
regardless of someone turning it off or
not we still need to copy and paste this
if block a hundred times this is
terrible there must be a solution right
well Java does have a solution and it's
called loops let's see how those work in
Java
instead of using if you could use
something called while which is very
similar to an if condition except that
instead of checking for this condition
once a while would continue to check
that condition and apply that block here
every time this condition is true so
what happens in a curb look like this is
that the wire would check if this on
variable is true if it is it would step
inside run this entire code block go
back up again check on again if it's
still true then it would go down and
repeat this part over and over again
until on is no longer true then it just
skips this part and continues this is
why this is called while loops because
it keeps looping over and over this code
block here as many times as needed while
this condition still remains true this
basically means that the single while
block here can replace all those
repeated if blocks over there so instead
of having to check our on variable
multiple times in multiple if blocks we
can just check it in a while loop and
that would repeat this block here over
and over until on is no longer true and
because we're updating our own variable
here using the check alarm function so
eventually this check alarm function
would return false when someone turns
the alarm off making our own variable
Falls so at some point this while would
quit let's trace this function using the
while loop and see how it works
so our updating function looks like so
we start by creating this boolean on and
checking the alarm and then instead of
having all these repeated if blocks we
just have this single while loop that
checks if on is true
if so
we just start beeping and then we update
on using the check alarm again remember
that check alarm function returns a
boolean which is true if the alarm is on
and false if the alarm has been turned
off let's trace this function and see
how it works the first thing we do is we
call our check alarm function to
initialize our own variable because it's
6 o'clock so our check alarm would
actually return true meaning that the
alarm should start beeping now so our
own variable here is true meaning that
our wild check here would be true so it
would step inside and start beeping so
this would actually trigger our alarm
clock to beep then we check our alarm
again to update our own variable and
because no one hit the snooze button yet
so check alarm still returns true makes
our on variable true we reach the end of
our loop so we go back up and we check
if that is true again because on is true
we step inside and call our B function
again which triggers our alarm clock to
beep then we check the alarm again now
imagine someone hits the snooze button
now this means when we call check alarm
to see if the alarm is still on it
actually returns false and therefore on
also becomes false so we've reached the
end of our loop we go back up we check
this comparison again and because while
is no longer true we do not step inside
and hence we don't beep so nothing
happens anymore and this basically means
that the while has ended and it will no
longer check or try again it will just
continue the program which doesn't have
anything else
so the function ends it seems like it's
doing exactly what we expected this
would continue to return true setting
our own variable to true making our
alarm beep for as long as it needs until
check alarm eventually decides to return
false after someone hits the snooze
button perfect you can see now that
using a while loop
can repeat something for a variable
number of times so we don't have to know
in advance how many times we need to
repeat something we just put it in a
while loop and make sure that our
condition would eventually turn false
ending our loop let's see a few more
