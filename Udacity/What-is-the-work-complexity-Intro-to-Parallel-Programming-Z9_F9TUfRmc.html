of iterations that we might have what
graph is going to give us the most
iterations and that graph is going to be
this awful looking linear chain how many
iterations is that going to have well
it's going to have on the order of the
iterations because we're going to have
the vertices here and how much work are
we going to do in each one of those
iterations well each one of these
iterations we know that we will visit
all e edges so if we take the amount of
work here as a product between V and E
we know that our final answer is going
to be on the order of V times E so we
know that it's at least going to be on
the order of V and we know that it's at
least going to be on the order of e
probably in any reasonable graph there's
going to be more edges than vertices
otherwise it's not a very interesting
graph and if that's the case we know
that the overall work complexity is
going to be at least order of V squared
it's quadratic in the number of vertices
and that's bad that is a very bad
property and so I told you at the
beginning of the discussion here that
this was a crummy algorithm and this is
why we really do not want an algorithm
that is quadratic in the number of
vertices</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
