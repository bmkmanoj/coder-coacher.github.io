investment varies depending on who
you're taking the money from so for
example in places like an accelerator
like an effect it's very structured
there is a date in which you have to
submit your application the application
are includes many questions we then
review the application we invite part of
the companies for interviews they come
for interviews we decide where it is we
have a date in which we announce to them
that their that they're in so that's
very structured and very easy which is a
big benefit for the companies because
they know when it's charged they know
when it when it ends when you look at
ancient investors or early stage fund is
very different the reason is that the
angel investor the fun do not have any
constraints on when do they need to
invest and as the early-stage investor
theoretically the best thing for you is
to delay a little bit and see what's
going to happen next and what's going to
happen next and so if you're about to
launch something I'll be stupid to not
wait and see how does that go right
because i'm going to give you money now
that's not true of course why because as
an investor if you're delaying the
company you're basically setting
yourself up for failure because as we
said speed is the most important thing
however the outcome of this is that the
processes are very unstructured and I
can tell you that there were companies
where at the end of a one-hour meeting I
told them I'm in and you know and then
we worked on the documents for not a few
days and I invested and I can tell you
there were companies that took me half
year to invest because it took me half
year to cross the chasm of believing in
the team that the team is strong enough
for that there's a great there's
something that we call there's product
market fit that everybody knows but
there's also what's called a founder
product fit or a founder market fit and
so you know many times it takes me a
period of time to get to know the
founders to believe that they're the
right people to win this domain and many
times they're great people but they're
just not the right people for this
domain so it's everything from one hour
to six months and it is for the
intrapreneur to manage the process
that's one of the things that
entrepreneurs are missing in most time
in most cases and when I said to manage
the process clearly part of it is
creating this this vector of movement of
investors that are starting to invest in
your company because investors at the
end of the day there
people and its people well most of them
are people and as people there is the
herd effect and when you hear that other
people have started committing it makes
your life a lot easier and so as
investors you need to sort of plan to to
have everything culminates to people
starting to invest and then going on and
everybody investing that's in terms of
the planning side which is not always
possible but it's when I say managing
the process the meaning is that you do
not need you can't let the ball drop and
if you expect the investor to be the one
leading the process then you're wrong
because the investor has 50 like you
that are all waiting and it's going to
be the ones that are driving the process
that are going to be getting more
attention and so I'm not you know and
there's a thin line between nagging and
overdoing it and running the process
properly but if you're just sitting
there waiting for the email to come back
and waiting for somebody to set up the
meeting and not being proactive you're
losing on to from the first thing that
somebody else is doing answer you're
getting less attention the second thing
your ability to present the right
character to the investor goes away and
so be proactive manage the process and
know that by basically getting many
investors to get to the decision point
at the same time who are dramatically
increasing your chance of raising the
money you want</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
