methods that can add considerable detail
to a model the first is displacement
mapping here a texture called a height
field is used to change the height of
the surface itself at each vertex in
other words each vertex has a UV value
this value is used to retrieve the
height value from the texture the height
value is then used to displace the
vertex in other words move it upward or
downward along its normal however simply
displacing the vertices does not change
the shading normals of the surrounding
surface you would see the bumpiness and
the silhouette of the object but
otherwise the shading would look fairly
similar to the original to change the
shading normals themselves and other
textures applied to the surface this
texture is called a normal map and is
considerably different than other
textures we've encountered up to this
point here's the displacement map for
the model and here's what the normal map
looks like the gray level of this height
field shows the amount to displace the
vertex with brighter pixels pushing
farther above the original surface the
normal map is in fact derived from this
displacement map and there are tools to
create this type of texture each normal
in the normal map is found from the
differences in the nearby heights in the
displacement map you can always tell a
normal map by its distinctive light blue
the normal map stores an XYZ direction
vector at each Texel when we view this
XYZ value as an RGB color we get this
type of look specifically the red
channel is X with positive to the right
the green channel is y with positive up
and blue is the z-axis this XYZ space is
relative to the surface of the model and
it's called tangent space if the normal
is not to be changed at all the normal
stored is 0 0 1 straight up the z axis a
value of 127 in this texture means 0 a
value of 255 means 1 the light blue then
comes from an x and y value of 0 which
gives a red and green channel of 127 the
Z value is 1 giving a blue channel of
255 so an unchanged normal has an RGB of
127 127 255 a light blue the basic idea
is that you're using this normal value
to change the existing shading normal
the normal in the texture map takes the
place of the shading normal and relative
to the shade normals original direction
here's the interesting part
once you have the normal map you don't
have to apply the displacement map
there's separate processes the
displacement map moves the vertices the
normal map modifies the shading normals
here
have from left to right the unmodified
head the head with just normal mapping
in the head with both while the model
with both mappings is the most
convincing using just the normal map
gives you much of what you want but with
many less triangles in fact artists
often first create highly detailed
geometric models a program can then bake
the normals into a normal map the mesh
can then be simplified saving both
processing time and memory while
retaining much of the detail of the
original having a surface that is smooth
but has differing shading normals is not
something we usually see in the real
world
in reality bumps are what caused the
surface to change its orientation
however it's finding computer graphics
to have one without the other we've
already been using the idea that the
shading normal can be different than the
geometric surface normal
here we are extending that idea varying
the shading normal / Texel instead of
per vertex</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
