challenges we have seen that when the
number of cores grows so does the
coherence traffic on the chip and for
that we needed a scalable on chip
network such as a mesh and the directory
coherence which we have already seen in
our cache coherence lesson another thing
that having more cores will make more
difficult is that as the number of
course goes up the off-chip traffic that
we need goes up to have decent
performance we will as we increase the
number of cores increase the number of
on-chip caches so if we have four cores
we have four level one and possibly
level two caches when we have 64 course
we'll have 64 level one and level two
caches so each core doesn't really
generate more misses but it generates
the same number of misses regardless of
how many cores we have so we have the
same number of mrs. per core so as we
have more cores the number of memory
requests which is what we do when we
have a Miss would go up in proportion to
the number of course now know that the
number of pins the number of those
little wires sticking out of a chip does
go up slowly but not in proportion or
anywhere close to in proportion to the
number of course so if we double the
number of course possibly we get maybe
ten percent more pins but that's it
because these pins have to physically be
large enough to not break when we are
moving the chip around and plugging it
into a motherboard so what happens is we
get some little improvement in off chip
throughput while our demand for it
basically grows in proportion to the
number of course so are off chip
available throughput becomes a
bottleneck so we need to reduce the
number of memory requests that we
generate per core and the way we do that
is to make the last level cache which in
most today's processors is the level 3
cash shared so that all cores go to that
cash and it's size is share
equally by all the cores and the size of
that cash needs to go up in proportion
to the number of cores as it goes up so
as we double the number of course we
should at least double the size of the
last level cache but there is a problem
to having one huge LLC like this such a
large cash would be slow and if it's
really one single cash it would have one
entry point where we enter the address
and expect the data out and that entry
point needs to be somewhere on our chip
that now possibly has a mesh or another
advanced network and that means that
that one point will be where we send all
of the level to mrs. so it would become
a bottleneck pretty much now we don't
get to use all of the links equally this
set of links that go to this entry point
for the cash would get much more traffic
than the other links if we double the
number of course then those links around
the entry point get double the traffic
so what we do is we don't have just one
big last level cache we have what is
called a distributed last level cache
now let's see what that looks like</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
