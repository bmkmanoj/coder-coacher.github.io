questions really do line up with not
just easy and hardness but actually line
up with understanding which is sort of
the assumption that we made right that
anyone can answer the easy questions but
as you know more you can answer the hard
questions that means the chance of you
being able to the sort of these
questions are aligned not just in terms
of easy and hard they're actually align
with some underlying notion of what you
actually know your knowledge is which
I'm just writing is understanding here
okay okay now furthermore let's say
let's imagine your understanding were
here okay this is really where you are
in this understanding scale it work
early yet that's where curly is okay in
this linear scale of you know knowledge
yeah so this linear scale of knowledge
about dinosaurs that apparently requires
some background in calculus you're
basically here on this linear scale well
what would that mean for you to be right
here well it probably means that for
questions way over here those really are
easy for you and you'll always get them
right uh-huh and for questions way out
here they're too hard for you and you're
probably going to get them almost
certainly get them wrong but one of the
interesting things about being right at
some particular level of understanding
is that you will occasionally get some
of these things just on this side of
your understanding right and you will
occasionally get things just on this
side of your understanding raw really
kind of understanding is like a
probability function and I'm going to
pretend it's Gaussian because you know
that's what we do in machine learning
and just kind of say sort of the
probability of you getting a question
right depends upon where your
understanding is and as you move far in
one direction you will always always get
them right far in another direction you
always always get them wrong but right
around your level of understanding
there's some noise there and you'll
sometimes get the ones that are just
beyond your understanding right and
sometimes get the things that are just
below your standing rock we actually
talked about this in the machine
learning class you might remember when
we talked about self play and learning
how to play games do you remember this
was a racquetball exam right we talked
we use a racquetball example and we
talked about how if you play someone who
is much much better than you are then
basically you never learn anything
because you always lose that's like the
hard questions those are like the hard
questions and if you play someone you're
much much better than you also never
learn anything because you always win
that's like
easy question right and in fact the
right thing to do is to place someone
who's just a little bit better adjust a
little bit worse than you that is right
around where you are and then you'll
actually learn something because the
exploration makes sense and sometimes
you get positive feedback sometimes you
get negative feedback and you learn how
to modify your actions into her okay
that makes sense to me right and so by
analogy that's what's happening here if
i can give you questions right around
where your level of understanding is
then you might learn something good so
given that highfalutin bought and taking
it all the way back to racquetball what
do you think a good set of incentives
might be I don't know I'm it's it like I
want what I wanted to say was well you
want to be getting like half of them
right and so we could pay off the
teacher well I guess we pay the learner
off for getting things right because
that's really the what the learner
should be striving for but we can pay
off the teacher for keeping things
around a half but that doesn't really
make sense because then the teacher
could do like I'm just going to randomly
choose from a really easy problem a
really hard problem and on average
that'll be a half so it'll really not be
asking any questions that are in that
happy zone oh that's good so actually
what you just said is pretty important
and it seems like a really bad idea no
no it's actually really cool you said
something in there really importance let
me point out to what you said you said
that if I tried to pick a half or any
distribution really okay then the
teacher can always just choose questions
to kind of get that distribution and
sometimes they'll be incentivize the
I'll just pick easy ones or hard ones
that where I know I'm going to be able
to get the distribution that I want
right and that sort of misses the point
yeah but what if I don't allow you to
pick the question what if instead I
require you to tell me where this line
