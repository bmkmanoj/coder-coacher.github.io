i'll give you intervals in which to
pause the video and implement the steps
on your own project feel free to do this
or to follow the whole video to the end
and try it all at once i'll start by
creating an empty project and then
adding a method called sandbox
playground you can pause here to do this
step now now within this method we need
to create an instance of NS file manager
this class allows us to find folders
copy files remove files etc will use
this to get the path to the documents
folder within our sandbox oddly enough
instead of a URL we're going to get an
array of URLs what's going on well if we
think about it there is actually more
than one documents folder right remember
there's one for each app install this
method works by returning all of them
but since we are only asking for one
right now we'll add in the second
parameter to filter out the ones that we
don't need now we have an array with
just the one URL we need so let's grab
it this is a URL to the documents folder
but I want a URL to the new file I'm
going to create that's pretty easy we
only have to add the name of the file
I'll do this now and then you can pause
the video and add it to your own code ok
so now we're ready to save something we
could use NS data or NS string both work
in a very similar way let's write the
text inside a string into a file there's
nothing wrong with being a little
paranoid when it comes to code so let's
make sure we wrote that correctly how
can we find that out let's read it and
see if it's the same content so did you
try on your end works perfect doesn't
work check out the companion text and
see if that helps so right now we've
just saved some data to disk and
retrieve that back but this doesn't
exactly seem practical for saving and
retrieving tons of data many different
types of objects several versions of the
data or showing it in views and handling
it with controllers and it isn't
but what we just did is just the bass
concert there are frameworks that build
on top of this let's see if Marty and
Doc have some ideas</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
