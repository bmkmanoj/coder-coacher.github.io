both worlds is called finger tables
where every node knows M other nodes in
the ring and the distance of the nodes
that it knows increases exponentially so
for example no ten would maintain
mappings for ten plus two to the zero
ten plus to the one and so forth where
finger I points to the successor of n
plus 2 I so finger zero would point to
the successor of eleven which is 32
finger one would also point to 32 and so
forth finger five would point to 43 now
every node knows its immediate successor
so what we want to do is find the
predecessor for a particular ID and then
ask for the successor of that ID so
let's suppose that node ten wanted to
look up a key corresponding to the ID of
42 it can use the finger tables to find
the predecessor of that node which in
this case is 32 it's finger tables have
the mapping of that nodes location as
well it then can ask node 32 for its
successor at this point we can move
forward around the ring looking for the
node whose successors ID is bigger than
the ID of the data which in this case is
node 43 due to the structure of the
finger table these lookups require order
of log n hops
this results in efficient lookups order
log n messages per look up and the size
of the finger table is order of log n
state per node another consideration
that we have to take into account is
what happens when nodes join and leave
the network when a new node joins we
first have to initialize the fingers of
this new node then we must update the
fingers of existing nodes so that they
know that they can point to the node
with the new ID and finally the third
step is to transfer the keys from the
successor to the new node in this case
the key that we must transfer from the
successor one is the data with ID of 54
in this case each node
sir is maintained and the successor of
any particular ID K is always
responsible for K a fall back for
handling leaves is to ensure that any
particular node not only keeps track of
its own finger table but also of the
fingers of any successor so that if a
node should fail at any time then the
predecessor node in the ring also knows
how to reach the nodes corresponding to
the entries in the failed nodes finger
