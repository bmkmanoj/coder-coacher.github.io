ones I've checked off are parallel to y
equals 4x minus 5 we can see this by
doing a little bit of rearranging so we
get each of these equations in the form
y equals MX plus B if we add why to both
sides of this equation we can rearrange
this equation so that instead it reads y
equals 4x this one is already written in
slope-intercept form and we can see that
its slope is in fact four just like that
of our original line if we divide both
sides of this equation by 2 and up with
y equals 4x minus one-half here m is the
same as in this equation for each of
these lines however which are not
parallel to this equation in order to
get y by itself we would have to divide
both sides by 2 this would change the
coefficient in front of the x that it's
no longer for which means that the slope
of this line is actually to the same
thing would happen for this equation so
this is the perfect example of how
sometimes even if the coefficient in
front of X makes it look like a line
could be parallel to another line we
have to make sure that the equation is
actually in slope-intercept form before
we can make assumptions about that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
