what we've built thus far using the
document outline you will notice that
there are two scenes in our app
currently one with the microphone button
and the other one that is empty if I
expand this first scene you will notice
that it has the microphone button the
recording in progress label and also the
stop button all of these three elements
are enclosed within this view here and
this view is managed by this view
controller over here so if I slide out
utilities we can actually confirm that
the class that is managing or
controlling this view is called view
controller the second scene is empty
right now which means that it currently
has nothing in its view and its current
view controller if I slide out the
utility area I can see is the iOS class
UI view controller so another way to
visualize this is to say that in the
first scene we have a view with several
buttons we also know that this view is
controlled by a class we made called
view controller this class inherits from
uiviewcontroller
which is a class that Apple wrote the
second scene currently has an empty view
which is controlled by UI view
controller directly so we can easily
spot views and view controllers in this
image you may notice however that the M
of this acronym or model is currently
missing from our image this is because
we haven't recorded any audio just yet
in our app</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
