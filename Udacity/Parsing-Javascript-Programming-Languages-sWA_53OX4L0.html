was it we've seen all of the relevant
rules well I haven't actually shown you
the detail for handling tag arguments
but we'll get a chance to look into that
later for now let's go on to JavaScript
which is actually going to have very
similar rules to HTML you may have
already guessed that a lot of the
options in JavaScript are very similar
we have a large number of binary
operators plus minus times divide less
than greater than and it turns out that
there's a very convenient notation when
we're programming grammars for getting
those all in rather than having to make
a separate little parsing function or
parsing rule for each one I can just
write out multiple related parsing rules
in the same string and give one piece of
code that applies uniformly to all of
them so we said before that this colon
kind of meant the arrow this vertical
bar it's as if we had written this same
non-terminal exp one more time and then
another arrow expression goes to
expression times expression this is just
a concise notation for your benefit so
that we don't have to type out as much
and here I'm showing how to make a
abstract syntax tree which again for us
is just nested tuples for a JavaScript
binary operator and in reality we'd want
to add in another rule for divide less
than greater than we might have ten of
these at the end of the day but it turns
out that our old friend ambiguity is
going to rear its head if my input is
one minus three minus five there are
actually two ways we might interpret
that or two parse trees we might end up
with and depending on which one we pick
we get a slightly different answer
this could mean one minus three minus
five at which point we'll get negative
seven or it could mean one minus three
minus five at which point we'll get
three we say that this first option is
what is known as left associative
because it puts the parentheses on the
left or the tree ends up being sort of
unbalanced towards the left
similarly this second option is right
associative</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
