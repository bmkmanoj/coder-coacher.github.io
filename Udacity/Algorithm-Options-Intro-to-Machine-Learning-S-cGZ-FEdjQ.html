algorithms to you these are all examples
of supervised classification algorithms
you should pick one
your choices are K nearest neighbors Ada
boost and random forests you don't know
what any of these are right now of
course but that's sort of the point
here's a tiny bit of information on each
one to maybe help you start making your
decision if you're brand new to machine
learning you've never done it before or
it's still kind of a challenge for you
to understand the algorithms that we've
talked about so far I would suggest
trying K nearest neighbors this is a
classic algorithm it's very simple and
easy to understand which is a big
advantage in a machine learning
algorithm that you know what's going on
if you're down with everything we've
done so far and you're ready for a
really interesting challenge I would
suggest a DES boost or random forests
which are both examples of what we call
ensemble methods the name ensemble
methods gives you a little bit of a hint
of what these two might be doing they're
meta classifiers that are built from
many usually decision trees so you have
many classifiers and you sort of have
them all working together to come up
with a single decision it's a little bit
like how we choose the president by
voting there's a single decision of
who's the president going to be and
there are many different people who have
different opinions on what that answer
should be and so what you have to do is
you ask the question of many different
people and altogether you come up with a
single answer that's a little bit like
what these two algorithms do it they do
it in slightly different ways however
any of the algorithms that you pick
should all be supported in SK learn so
you can rely on SK learn having
something that you can use straight out
of the box</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
