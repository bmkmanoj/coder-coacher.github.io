ideas in the acronym specs simplify code
and practice kindness let's talk about
the pod which is explained why and with
examples we've found that some of our
best reviewers are folks who take the
time to explain why they are making the
suggestions they are they also write
code snippets and provide working
examples to back up their
recommendations let me give you an
example there a student in one of our
Python courses created a class called
City and then added a bunch of instance
variables like name latitude and
longitude to that class this student
then created a method called debug
inside that class that printed all of
the instance variables the student said
that he used this method for debugging
purposes now this code was reviewed by
imran nazir who is a Udacity code
reviewer and we absolutely love what
Imran had to say about this code let's
go through it together Imran says that
you created a specific method for
printing out the internals of an
instance they showed foresight well done
so Imran is identifying what the student
did well that is good he goes on to say
that you could also achieve the same
thing with the virus function now this
is interesting Imran is pointing the
student to a website if we go to that
site we see the documentation for the
function VARs now this function returns
the attribute for an instance this by
the way is exactly what our student was
trying to do with the function they'd
written themselves okay let's go back to
the review Imran goes on to say I've
also created a code snippet for you to
play with here Imran is using a tool
called gist which is a simple way to
share code snippets when I visit this
page I see that Imran wrote some code on
how to use the vars function now this is
a really helpful tool for the student to
understand the recommendation imran is
making we find that our best reviewers
provide examples to back up the
recommendations they are making let's
see a few more instances of this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
