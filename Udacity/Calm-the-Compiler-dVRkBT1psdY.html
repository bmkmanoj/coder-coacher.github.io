the file entitled lesson 8 calm the
compiler and now we're going to play a
few rounds of calm the compiler you'll
see a series of compiler errors and
quiet them by using the correct protocol
syntax in this first error the minion
class has adopted the dirty deeds
protocol but the compiler is complaining
type minion does not conform to protocol
dirty deeds pause the video take a
minute to fix this error and then
continue on to conform to the dirty
deeds protocol the minion class needs to
implement the methods cheat and steal so
if we add those implementations the
compiler is happy again let's try
another one here we have our dinner crew
class again along with the sous-chef
protocol the goal here is to initialize
a devious dinner crew with an array of
minions but we get the following error
cannot invoke initializer for type
dinner crew with an argument list of
type members minion how can we fix this
what could be wrong with the argument
list right now the minion class does not
adopt the sous-chef protocol so minions
can't be a part of the devious dinner
crew if we add the sous-chef protocol to
the minion class definition and then
implement the methods in the sous-chef
protocol chop and rinse this error goes
away let's do one more here we have the
dog-walker protocol in the class
neighbor is adopting this protocol we've
seen this error before type neighbor
does not conform to protocol dog walker
last time we got this error it was
because we hadn't implemented the
protocol method yet but here you can see
that the methods have been implemented
what's going on here's what's going on
the throw ball method signature in the
protocol definition indicates that throw
ball should return an int the throw ball
method in the neighbor class on the
other hand is not returning anything if
we add the return type int to neighbors
implementation of throw ball and then
add the line return count the compiler
is satisfied</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
