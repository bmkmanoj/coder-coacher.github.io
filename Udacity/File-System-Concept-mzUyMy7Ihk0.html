you're going to interact with the file
system here you see me navigating the
file system on my computer to find this
presentation there it is I started off
in my home folder inside of there I went
to pictures and then the file systems
and there I found the image that I was
looking for this is really convenient in
my case the data I was looking for was
on the hard disk on my local machine but
I didn't have to remember physically
where the data was ie the platter the
track the sector number etc instead I
was able to access the data through a
very intuitive interface provided by a
file system module of the operating
system there at least three key
abstractions at work here
the first is the notion of the file
itself in reality the data may not be
placed next to each other on a disk all
in the right order but an application
developer the author of the sketchbook
program I'm using for instance gets to
create the data of a file as one big
long contiguous string of bytes second
is the file name I don't have to
remember any of the physical information
about how off my file is stored the
sector number where it starts for
instance instead I get to assign my file
an intuitive name in my case image
double o1 tiff third is the notion of
folders or directories as we will call
them these are containers for other
files or directories that help keep
things organized the idea is that we
have an electronic version of what was
once the more common physical filing
system we put folders within folders to
help us keep things organized so on this
machine then I don't just have a
pictures folder but also a Documents
folder and within there I have a folder
for advanced operating systems and maybe
there's another one for a software
development process etc and even this
home directory sits inside a larger
directory for all users which then sits
inside of a directory called root which
then contains folders for the operating
system and other things this directory
is called the root because if we think
of this directory structure as an
upside-down tree then this
all-encompassing directory would be the
root or the base of the tree
indeed the structure will always be a
tree just by the nature of directories
or the nature of physical file folders
for that
we call the directory immediately above
another directory its parent file
systems for instance is the parent
directory of image w1 TIFF pictures is
the parent directory of file systems etc
together these three abstractions
provide a convenient an almost universal
interface for storing and retrieving
data for mass storage in this lecture
we'll talk about how this interface is
implemented and some of the common
optimizations we'll focus on the disk
medium but many of the ideas we discuss
apply to other media as well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
