and/or now and the expressions got kind
of complicated
in fact so complicated that they've
attracted the interest of mathematicians
such as this Stern looking fellow
his name is George Boole and he figure
out the rules for working with
conditions that could be true or false
and ever since that's been called
boolean logic now why do we care we want
our programs to be simpler to read and
so when we have a long and complex
condition such as this one we might want
to put it in a separate method let's
think about what this test here was this
was the test for the S flag where you
had a blue square in the middle this
test you checked is our pixel in the
middle all right so if we had a method
that could test that we could say if x
and y is in the middle then we want blue
otherwise white
much easier to read let's go and write
this method here it is is in middle
takes an X and an y coordinate and here
you have the exact same condition that
we've had before and we simply compute
and return that there's just one catch
we have to specify a return type for
this method and what is this thing
that's being returned well it's either
true or false in Java
the type that has two values true and
false is called boolean in honor of our
friend George here it is so when you
have a method that can return a
condition that's true or false you
declare it as a boolean method then you
can use that method inside an if
statement just as much as you can use
the relational operators you would want
to do that whenever a condition has
become so complicated
that you want to put it inside its own
method you can also declare variables of
boolean type let me give you a quick
example
ivory implemented is a middle method to
use two boolean variables let's check it
out the first variable X in middle
checks whether X is between one-third
and two-thirds of the width it's set to
true if this condition is fulfilled or
to false if it's not
and similarly this variable over here Y
in middle is set to true when this
condition is fulfilled and to false if
it's not
why might I want to do this because each
of those conditions is complicated
enough that by saving it in a variable
it makes the code easier to read now
over here I say if both of these
conditions are fulfilled then the point
is in the middle so I returned the end
of these two generally you use a boolean
variable if you want to remember a value
that's true or false so that he can use
it later Sarah has an example of that
for you in a different context</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
