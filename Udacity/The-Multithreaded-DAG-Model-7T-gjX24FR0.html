represent a parallel computation by a
directed acyclic graph or a dag like
this one each vertex is in operation
like a plus or an addition or function
call or a branch the directed edges show
you how operations depend on one another
where the syncs depend on the sources so
this is what do you think and this would
be a source and this would say that C
depends on the output or result of B now
to keep things simple
I'll always ask you to assume that
there's exactly one starting vertex and
one exit vertex so in this example
here's the start and here's the exit and
of course if you have a dag and there
are no such vertices if you start and
exit once it's pretty easy to add them
now suppose you have a P Ram machine and
you want to use it to run the
computation you start by trying to find
any operations that are ready to go that
is all of their input dependences are
satisfied so in this example take a look
at the starting vertex that one's ready
to go since it's ready to go
meaning it has no dependences we can
assign it to any processor that's free
and go ahead and start executing
so here I've assigned starting vertex s
to processor 3 and processor 3 will
start executing it now as soon as a
processor finishes its operation it
enables any of its successors to begin
so in this example a and B only depend
on s so as soon as S is finished a and B
can start so now a and B are ready to go
so we can look for any free processors
and assigned a and B to them so for
example it looks like processor 1 and
processor 3 are free so let's assign a
and B to them
now when processor 1 and processor 3
finished their units of work then that
will enable other successors in this
case vertices C and D and this process
will repeat until we finish now at every
step of the computation this problem of
how to take free units of work and
assign them to processors is called the
scheduling problem scheduling is a huge
topic and you will hear more about it
soon enough given a dag in a peer am
here's a question how long will it take
to run
the dag to answer this question you need
a cost model for now I'm going to use a
cost model that makes three assumptions
the first assumption is that all
processors run at the same speed the
second assumption is that each operation
takes one unit of time and the last
assumption is that these edges don't
have any costs associated with them so
let's start with these assumptions and
let's apply them to some sample DAGs</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
