mechanisms that exokernel offers and how
library operating systems can live on
top of this red line that is a
protection boundary for exokernel and
meaningfully execute applications that
belong to it on the hardware resources
and not interfere with one another that
is achieved both extensibility
protection and performance so one of the
hooks for getting good performance is
what I mentioned earlier and that is
code that a performance critical for a
library operating system is something
that can be downloaded securely into the
exokernel so that that piece of code
becomes sort of the extension of
exokernel for a particular library
operating system this may be for OS one
this may be for is two and so on and so
forth so now with this set up at any
point of time some application process
of some library operating system is
running on the CPU now remember that
exokernel has no idea about processes
within any of these library operating
system all it knows is existence of
these library operating systems and the
fact that exokernel
has been the broker in giving some
hardware resources capabilities for some
hardware resources I should say to
specific library operating systems and
it has also been the broker for
downloading some code specific to
library operating systems into the
exokernel code base itself let's say
that this particular thread belongs to
this library operating system as long as
this thread is well behaved by which I
mean it's not doing anything funky doing
normal program execution accessing
memory for which mappings exist in the
TLB and so on
life is good address translation happens
on every memory access entirely in the
cpu and the process is making forward
progress at memory speeds without
intervention from exokernel or any other
library operating system but there could
be discontinuities
in the execution of this process for
example let's say that this process of
thread makes a system call like opening
a file when it does that that is a
discontinuity in the normal execution of
this process or worse yet it may incur a
page fault meaning that not all of the
pages for this particular process is
currently in the mapping available to
the hardware in the TLB and therefore
there's a page fault even worse this
thread could do something stupid such as
divide by 0 or something like that that
causes an exception and lastly the
thread is not doing anything to cause
the discontinuity but there is an
external interrupt that came in and that
is going to cause a discontinuity to
this execution of this process on the
CPU all such discontinuities essentially
result in the CPU incurring a fault or a
trap and the trap is fielded by
exokernel when such discontinuities
occur exokernel
has to pass the program discontinuity to
the appropriate library operating system
that is living on top of it now
exokernel knows based on the linear
vector of time slots that i mentioned
earlier which library operating system
is currently running on the cpu and
therefore it knows the right library
operating system to which it has to pass
the discontinuity that occurred right
now for the currently executing process
to facilitate a finer grain association
between these different kinds of
discontinuities and the specific
functionality in the library operating
system for dealing with those
discontinuities exokernel maintains
State for each currently executing
library operating system and we will
discuss the state maintained by
exokernel
on behalf of every library operating
system next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
