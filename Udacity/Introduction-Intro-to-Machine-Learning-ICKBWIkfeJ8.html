Katy Malone and this is the machine
learning class here at Udacity for
everybody to learn machine learning I am
a research professor at Stanford I'm the
founder of Udacity I also did things
like Google self-driving car the dog
software in Car Challenge race Google
Street View whoo a glass Google X and
the secret behind my work is it all
reduces to machine learning machine
learning is the core of what I do and
machine learning enables me to build
amazing products amazing user
experiences I'm a physicist by training
so I have a little bit of a different
background but in physics we use machine
learning all the time - so what we do is
we start with gigantic datasets of lots
of particles that we create in our
detector and we use machine learning to
comb through those huge datasets and
find the the one event or the the ten
events out of the millions and billions
that help us win Nobel prizes and doing
good machine learning is just like
making great wine sell a bottle of wine
here from Italy the analogy goes as
follows if you want to make a really
great wine you have to write great
grapes if your grades are no good your
wine is no good same is true for machine
learning you need good data you need to
really understand your data very well
and then there's a technique to it to
make really great violence really hard
to learn same is true for machine
learning there's a technique to look at
data to understand data to apply
algorithms if you don't master the
technique you will never be a great
machine learning person so in this class
in our machine learning class we're
going to start with a bunch of machine
learning algorithms but we're also going
to be looking at some really interesting
data sets and we're going to be asking
some really interesting and kind of hard
questions but questions that we think
are going to be really cool to answer so
we're going to start from raw data and
then we're going to show you a machine
learning process this sort of goes from
beginning to end so that you can start
with a data set of your own and you know
how to tackle it using machine learning
we are here in Silicon Valley and in
Silicon Valley machine learning is a big
deal
cognizant Netflix Amazon Google and many
others use data on a daily basis to
optimize the product experience and I
can tell you if you're proficient in big
data understand data science very well
you will find a job in Silicon Valley
very likely and the starting salaries
are unbelievably high they're often
north of 150 200 thousand dollars and
even if you're not looking for a job in
data science right now there's still
probably lots of ways that machine
learning is
that you use everyday so when I go on
Netflix at night how do I figure out
what what movie I'm going to watch
Netflix makes a recommendation using
machine learning when I use my credit
card to make a purchase there's fraud
protection on it that's machine learning
as well we're going to get some insights
into how all kinds of tools that you use
everyday are working in they're built on
top of machine learning so it's a really
great class it's all learning by doing
see you in class</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
