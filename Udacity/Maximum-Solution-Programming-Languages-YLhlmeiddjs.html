of the non-empty list L that maximizes
the return value of F and I'm just going
to call this function find max FFL
conceptually one way to do this is to
keep track of the best thing you've seen
so far and then just walk over the list
and notice if you ever see anything
better now i'm going to make to
descriptive variable names the best
element I've seen so far and the best f
value I've seen so far and then what I
want to do is iterate over all the
possible elements in the list without
walking off the end and I'll pull out
that element and call the function f on
it if we either haven't seen anything
good yet or what we just saw is better
than the best thing we've seen
previously congratulations you the
current element are promoted to the new
champion and then eventually when we're
done we just return the best element so
far now I personally recommend making
small test cases at the beginning just
so that we can get a feel for how it's
going before we move to that big Barbara
Kingsolver thing well let's see if I
manage to write this Python program
without any mistakes this is actually
not obvious no there is a mistake return
best elements so far here's the error at
the bottom unen dent does not match any
outer indentation level this is on line
13 let's scroll back up and actually I
think they are right I needed one more
space there I don't know if you could
see this before for some reason it
hadn't tabbed over the whole way but now
I've made it tab over the whole way so
let's try again ah and now it returns
quick which is what we expected that's
the element of this list with the
greatest length let's try another test
try 5 negative 6 3 and 2 and this time
we want to find the element with the
greatest absolute value and that should
be negative 6 and it is Wow looks like
find max is really working out well
except that it's totally not there's
actually a bug in this implementation so
the test that I've been making they're
all in sort of random order you really
want to try all the corner cases and for
something that takes a list as input
corner cases to consider are in order in
reverse order and random but we we tried
two tests but they were both sort of in
random order and when you're testing a
program that involves lists you want to
try in order reverse order and also
random so let's try this on reverse
order and see if it gets the right
answer should be four and in fact it is
excellent now let's try it on in order
and see if it gets the right answer
should be negative 40 it is negative 3
that's not the right answer hmm what do
we do there's a bug in our code
somewhere and we may not know where one
of the first approaches to figuring out
what's going on is called print
statement debugging so here what I'm
doing is changing my program so that
every time we enter this loop we print
out what the value of I is just to make
sure that things are on track here we're
trying to print out the element and the
F value let's go see if I can even add
print debugging without something going
wrong all right this looks pretty good
so we start out when I is 0 and the
element there is one and the F value is
1 looking good then I is 1 the element
is to F values too good and then I is to
the element is 3 the f value is 3 well
this convinces me that were actually
calling the absolute value but you know
the thing I was expecting to see was
negative 4 and we never seem to get
there so this suggests to me that I
isn't getting high enough well we know
that I is going over every element in
this range so let's print that out to
gain some understanding range len L
minus 1 so now here at the beginning it
tells us that I is only ranging over 0 1
and 2 but we really want it to range / 0
1 2 3 and in fact we can make this even
super obvious let's make an even simpler
list that we're going to fail at now the
list and the element indices are the
same we really want to get out the
answer 3 but if we look down here I only
ranges / 0 1 2 0 0 0 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 is
the best so we return it so we're not
getting to this last element so there
must be something wrong with this set
and I'm guessing since we're missing the
last element that this minus 1 we don't
really need to be subtracting 1 now many
people are often tempted to subtract one
because Python lists start at zero and
you don't want to walk over the end here
we'll just print out range for to
satisfy ourselves that it's 0 1 2 3 yep
so range 4 is 0 1 2 3 now I ranges / 0 1
2 3 and now we're getting the answer we
expect
so now let's go back to the problem we
were actually given Barbara Kingsolver
wrote The Poisonwood Bible and hopefully
we'll get either kingsolver or
Poisonwood out assuming I can count
Barbara is seven kingsolver is 10 wrote
is 5 is 3 Poisonwood is 10 and we end up
with Kingsolver at the end of the day
which is a perfectly acceptable answer
but we've got all this print debugging
and if the problem doesn't call for that
we should typically remove it before
submitting lest it be counted as part of
our outputting caused us to get the
problem wrong now we just returned
kingsolver</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
