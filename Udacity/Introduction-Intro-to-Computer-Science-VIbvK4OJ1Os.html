everyone's gaining confidence in the
things you learned in unit 1 we're gonna
continue to build on those in this unit
as well as in the rest of the course our
main goal for this unit is to make the
web crawler instead of just finding one
link on a page to find all of the links
on a page so we could follow those links
and collect more and more pages on the
web to do that we need two big new
concepts in computer science
the first is procedures procedures are a
way to package code so we can reuse it
more easily
the second is control we need a way to
be able to make decisions and do new
repetition to find all those links on
the page what we saw at the end of unit
1 was a way to extract the first URL
found on a web page that's great we
could find the first target but if we
want to build a good crawler well we
don't just care about the first one we
care about all of the links on the page
we need to extract all of those links
figure out where all of those links
point to so we'll find many more pages
to crawl than just the first one so
that's the goal for this class as far as
building a web browser to do that we're
going to learn two really big ideas in
computer science the first is about
procedures and that's a way to package
up code so we can use it in a much more
useful way than we could before and the
second is about control and control
structures will give us a way to keep
going to find all the links on a page so
let's remember the code we had at the
end of unit 1 we solved this problem of
extracting the first URL from the page
we assumed the page was initialized to
the contents of some webpage we
initialized the variable start linked to
the result of invoking find on page
passing in the start of a link tag then
we initialized the variable start quote
to the result of finding in the page the
first quote following that link tag then
we initialize the variable end quote to
the result of invoking find on page to
find the first quote following the start
quote and then we assigned to the
variable URL extracting from the page
from the character after the start quote
to the character just before the end
quote we could print out that URL and
this worked to find the first URL on the
page if we wanted to fine
the second one well we could do it all
again we could say well now we want to
advance so we're only looking at the
rest of the page so we could do that by
updating the variable page assigning to
it the result of the rest of the page
starting from end quote and remember
when there's a blank after the colon
that means select from this position to
the very end and then we could do all
the same stuff so we'll do start link
again we'll do start quote again so now
we've got code that's going to print out
the first URL keep going
updating the variable page and then
doing the exact same thing printing out
the second URL if we wanted to print out
the first three well we could do it
again
so now we've got code to print out the
first three URLs on the page let's
scroll all the way up so you got
printout the first one keep going
print out the second one keep going so
this can go on forever so the reason we
have computers is to save humans from
doing lots of tedious work we don't want
to make humans do lots of tedious work
certainly typing this out over and over
again would be really tedious and it
wouldn't really even work that well we
have pages with hundreds of links but
their other pages with only one or two
links so it wouldn't make sense to copy
this hundreds of times there's always
going to be some webpage that has more
links than we have copies of it and any
page that has fewer copies we're gonna
run into problems because we're not
going to be finding any of those links
so our goal today is to solve all of
those problems</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
