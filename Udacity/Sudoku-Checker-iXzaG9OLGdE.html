yeah my name is mark I'm coach Udacity
and I'm Andy and helping guide you
through this nanodegree awesome yeah so
today we'll be having a live coding
session with Andy especially
specifically about Python so last week
we had a coding session with Annie about
HTML CSS right and now we are diving
into the world of Python programming now
before we start having any do or a
coding session I want to have a little
announcement for especially especially
for Windows users who are having trouble
submitting their projects in our vein
portal there was an error for Windows
users they could not submit their zip
file for upgrading that has been
resolved so our engineer is just fixed
it today things are they're pushing the
code live to our production servers
right now so at the end of today please
resubmit your file again and it should
work now if it does not work please let
us know on the forums or email us at
intro programming - support at
udacity.com once again it's intro
programming - support at udacity.com
ok great now I'm just gonna head over to
Annie alright so the purpose of this
live coding session is to walk through
how I think about solving a large
problem that involves programming you've
heard a lot of feedback in the forums
especially people who've made it some
decent ways through the second course
that you can read the code that somebody
else has written you can see the
solutions for to get what it does back
time coming up with an answer on your
own and that's very normal that is a
stage of learning to program that you go
through this stuff takes a lot of
practice and it's going to take a lot of
time before you get to the point where
you can create problems or create
solutions to big problems on your own
with any in any reasonable amount of
time but it comes to practice and one
way to get that practice is to see how
other people go about solving those
problems and so that's what we're gonna
do today if you're in the first if
you're in the most recent cohort the
women begin in March your
I'm still thinking about HTML and that's
fine this may not be as useful for you
as it is for people who have already
started working on Python it may be a
little useful seeing how I think about
decomposing a big problem into smaller
pieces but it's gonna be hard to follow
along so keep that in mind next week
we'll do something a little more HTML
friendly but for now we're gonna do this
up in Python and so let me share my
screen so you can let me know what your
shares so I get let's see all right
you're sharing you're screwing so all
right so the problem we want to solve
today is writing something that we check
to see if a Sudoku solution is correct I
chose this because you can represent
this you Doku puzzle pretty easily
as a list of lists and I know that I
depending on how far in the nanodegree
you are so far you know what lists are
and you have some familiarity that if
you don't that's okay all along we're
safe come back to this video later but
to Toco puzzle you get a grid that's
partially filled out with numbers and
the goal you can see either the red
letters numbers here just to fill it out
in such a way that as you go across all
of the rows you use the numbers one
through nine as you go down all the
columns you use the numbers one through
nine into this column you'll see one two
three four five six seven eight and nine
and then likewise with all these ECB's
nine square square zero square one two
three four five six seven eight
sorry I count from zero that's me being
quite fun person but you can still tell
that each of these squares also uses the
numbers one through nine
so I just phrased to you I had to check
and see if a solution correct instead
okay right
check the rows check the columns check
the squares but how do we do that in
programming how do we begin to approach
this giant problem so let me pull up
sublime text and feel free to ask
questions along the way marks keeping an
eye on the phone what you guys are
saying so if there's any questions I'll
try and get to them so I hope you can
see this you
looks pretty good it's good yeah sir
down three steps that I'd like to follow
when solving a problem first I want to
understand the problem and I'm gonna
think of understanding it in terms of
inputs and outputs this isn't how we
think as humans but it's how we think is
programmers because that's polka
piercing then I'm going to plant a
solution and I'll show you how to how to
go about planning a solution then I'm
going to fill it out and I said fill it
out and you'll see what I mean by that
as we go
so first let's understand the studio of
it from what are the inputs I want to
represent a Sudoku puzzle as a grid like
this and they call this invalid grade
because this doesn't meet some of the
specifications judoka
you can tell this grid is a list so here
is the the outermost brackets to say
this is a list and then inside that list
I have nine lists one two three four
five six seven eight nine and you can
probably guess how this this is supports
to represent that pseudo keyboard I
didn't represent any squares in here yet
but that was a choice we'll get to that
later and this code down here I just
found a valid pseudo cout puzzle so this
this solution actually check the rows
add up or the rows have the correct
number numbers the columns do too and
the same with the scores all right so I
understand the inputs in the case of the
studio cout puzzle I'll say it's a list
of lists and maybe I would give an
example but I did that down here in Bali
grid and then the outputs well all I
want to know is if as a given input is a
good solution to a pseudo coup or if
it's not so true or false Intel can
output I might have some print
statements along the way to help me as I
think about you know debugging this
thing but we'll get to that in a second
now let's plan a solution and since I
don't have paper I'm gonna opt for this
pretend code version let me let me show
you what that means so I'm gonna write
code and I'm gonna pretend like I
access to functions that I haven't even
written yet and that turns out for me to
be a really helpful way to approach
these big problems instead of diving
into the details first I'm gonna make up
function
I'm gonna call it check sudo it's gonna
take as input me sudo qu great now what
do I want this check sudo can function
to do let's see well I want it to return
true if it develops utopias how would I
tell if its develop pseudo code well we
talked about earlier we need to check
the rows the columns in the squares so
I'm gonna write this if check rows of
Sudoku grid I'm gonna write equals true
you don't actually need that but I'm
gonna write that to make it a little
more clear and then I'm gonna I'm gonna
print just to let me know let me keep
track what's going on if the rows look
good then I'm gonna check the columns
check columns of the pseudo community
great it's true I'm also going to print
columns of good and then I'm gonna check
the squares there are other ways we
could have could've written what I'm
writing here we could have done this in
a single line I could have said if check
rows and check columns and check squares
I like this because it's gonna slowly
let us see throws are good columns and
so on now I can just return true because
now we've made it all the way this is a
valid pseudo good grade we've checked
squares we check the columns we check
the rows but you're probably saying but
you don't have those functions yet you
haven't written check rows even written
Chet Collins and that's absolutely true
and if I try to run this function now
print check pseudo cout both the valley
graded from up above actually I'm gonna
write these in all caps to good practice
if you just have variables hanging out
there
type of the function to write them as
all caps okay so let's see what's gonna
happen I'm gonna hit on my Mac come in B
turn this I think it'd be probably ctrl
or alt B Windows machine right yeah you
see down low and then down here is my
output yeah
and how am I gonna read this okay let's
let's read through this from the very
top trace back most recent call last so
actually want to go the other way I'm
going to start the bottom I usually you
start the bottom of these things so name
era global name check Rose is not
defined so that means that I called this
function xiÃ¨xiÃ¨ Doku it tried to call
this but of course it wasn't defined and
I should have known that was gonna
happen so I didn't know that was going
to happen but that's here that's okay
that's define it in this system of
gradually fleshing out your um solution
you start from the biggest picture
checks your Doku right it just means I'm
gonna check the rows the columns in the
squares and then as your code doesn't
run you just keep refining it until it
looks like it's working so I'm gonna
write Jeff check
Rose I'm just gonna actually way this
grid I just want to be clear which
variables are which it can get confusing
when you have similar words and the same
parameters and all that so check roast
so this pseudocode grid is a list of
lists so I can use a for loop to go
through the rows of that list so for row
and grid and to show you what that mean
what that actually does let's just print
out each of those rows first and I'm
going to comment this out and we're just
going to dude check rows of that ballot
of that a valid grid so you can see for
wrong grid it prints the row and also
prints each one on a new line that's why
are you only you don't see those the
brackets at the very beginning in the
very end you
is just printing the things inside of
that that grid which are the elements
the rows okay so now I know how to get
access to each of those rows I'll call
you to these numbers a cell because it
seems to make sense we've rose
we have columns and each of these little
squares the value inside will cause cell
so I'm going to do another for loop I'm
gonna do for cell in row and just to
remind you what this is gonna print
let's just look at exactly what this
does and this is kind of a mess but you
can see 4 3 5 2 6 9 it's exactly it's
just printing out each individual egg or
okay so so that's how we iterate to our
grid now what do I actually when do I'm
checking the row I want to check and
make sure that each row is valid so if
let's say is valid row and again I'm
making up a function so what do I want
to do actually so this is where I have
to stop and think I want to go through
all of these rows and if one of them is
bad then the whole thing is bad and I
want to return false so I shall we do if
is valid row if any of these are not
valid if any of them are false I'm gonna
return false this is no good and only
when I've gone through this whole for
loop and confirmed that none of them are
false I haven't returned anything yet
only then will I make it down here and
be able to actually return true and you
know if I ran check rows here I'm
getting the is valid rows not defined as
expected so let's just write that data
is valid row and I'm going to make I
have my desired things I yeah up here
so um required numbers these are the
numbers that I need to see in each row I
need to see 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 there's of
a clever I could have done that using
called pythons range function but I'm
gonna just write it out for you guys and
let's see what everyone do let's do for
a number in required numbers so that's
going to go through all those numbers 1
2 3 4 or 5 if that number is not in the
row that's bad that's not a big row so
we're gonna return false and only if
we've gone through and valid verified
that it's all those numbers are can we
return trip and look now we've we've
gotten somewhere we haven't written any
pretend phone anything that's fake so in
theory if we check the rows of something
of a grid-like valid grid maybe it'll
return true if we haven't messed up oh
do print check rows stroke cool well
that worked so so the valley grid has
valid rows at least we we haven't
checked its columns let's actually look
at the invalid grid yeah let's check
that and that's true too but that's okay
that doesn't mean our code is Beggs if
you look at the inga valid grid I just
made a bunch of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 so
those rows actually are all good so
that's I mean that's why we have the
column check because that's not enough
for us you don't good ok cool so let's
zoom out for a second let me pull this
down there's this thing you can do in
sublime you click these little triangles
and it just collapses everything
so check Rose gets couldn't collapse
down check see Duke who gets collapse
down I can collapse that collapse that
ok so let's go back to check seed ok
that's up in that so we've gotten check
rows figure it out now when you do check
columns so let's let's define that
function
in the meta point I collapsed these rows
these functions I can open them up again
by clicking the green arrow or that Lily
runs next to it I like leaving them
collapsed it's just less for me to have
to look at and think about keep my mind
like workspace clean
so check columns Wow how am I going to
check columns Rick you know rows were a
little easier because the list
themselves were in rows so yes this is
not this is not this is not as easy so
one thing I could do I could say well I
know I want to check index zero if ever
you are oh yeah oh and check index 1 1
check index - that's a good systematic
way of thinking okay okay so um so let's
see I'm gonna do 4 index and this is
where I'm actually gonna use this range
function range 9 let me show you what
range 9 prints out um sorry let me do
that right up here so I just ran that
this code and sorry donate your head
Network so indentation err this happens
all the time and Python I love Python I
loved other other languages use these
curly braces everywhere and brackets and
parentheses and it's easy to forget
those two but Python it has a problem
it's easy to mess up your notation so
let's go to line 61 and see what the
problem is
so here's 61 ah I wrote this for loop
but I don't have anything let me just
comment this whole thing out
thank you let me get rid of this as well
ok so now let's try that again okay
range 9 generates all the numbers a list
of all the numbers between zero and just
up to 9 1 less so up to 8 okay so let's
let's do our check columns where did
Chicago here
so what I want to do I have I'm gonna go
through all the in so index will be 0
and then 1 and then 2 and what I really
want is when index is 0 I want to make I
want to check all of the these down at
index 0 and I want to check all the ones
at index 1 ok so I could do this with
another pretend function but I think I'm
just gonna write this one so let's see
so I'm gonna do um up above here I'm
gonna make an empty list redhot columns
and each of these I'm gonna make a new
column so I'm gonna go over every row in
the grid and first I'm gonna make a new
empty column and for every row in the
grid I'm gonna get whatever the value is
that index so either 0 or 1 or 2 or
whatever I'm gonna add it to my new
column so that's gonna be row of index
now if this the code we have here this
line of code the only reason I could
write this so quickly
and I'm not sure it's gonna work but I
think it will but the only reason I can
write this so quickly is because I've
written lines similar to this a hundred
times before
I've thought of going through lists of
Lists and keeping track of an index and
if this looks very foreign or how would
you ever come up with it the answer is
just practice it's it's a new language
Python is a new language for you and
like anything fluency comes with
practice but here we go
so I'm gonna add the right entry that's
row index to my new column
gone through every row in the grid I'm
gonna add my new column yeah my new
column to these columns because now what
I have is these let's just print columns
so we can show you like what we've done
here if this works so I'm going to take
that this invalid grid which is 1 2 3 4
5 7 8 9 and so on and I'm gonna see what
happens I do check columns up there it's
not it's not check it it's actually
checking the comte it's not complete but
and you guess it's not what its gonna
return hmm I guess yeah okay let me try
this one more time we should sue for
four columns yeah in because it was
giving me this whole list yes I just
want to print on each column one time
you call and I'm gonna make this there
we go
you've basically converted all the
columns into weight and get rid of this
enough line that's confusing where's
that line that's the range knife okay
okay so see what we had before we had
ones going all the way down the side and
now we have ones going all the way along
the top now the reason I did this it's
because I know how to check rows I've
already written the function so now I'm
actually I can return in columns I'm
just gonna return check rows on those
columns because I know how to do that so
let's see what happens when we check the
pseudo ku on our valley grid at this
point and let me get rid us okay Rose
look good the columns are good so it
looks like this check columns function
and I should let you all know I wrote
this code before we did this and there
were a lot of bugs along the way I do
not want you to think this is how the
coding process works this took me a long
time to figure it out and I'm just
showing you in a in a shortened form
how I thought about it yes normally
there'd be a ton of errors there were a
ton of errors that is that's how it
actually goes so okay the girls look
good in the columns okay so let's zoom
out again I'm a big fan of zooming out
all right we've got we've got a function
called check sodoku it takes as input a
grid that looks something like this a
list of lists and it goes through it
first it checks the rows to make sure
that they each have the values 1 through
9 then it goes through and checks the
columns to make sure that each of the
values 1 through 9 then it goes through
and well soon you'll go through and
check the squares we can see in our
traceback error all the way down here
global name check squares is not to find
checks where it's not to find right I'm
having I haven't defined yet so looks
like we know what we have to do next let
me just put these all next to each other
so you can see model on screen this is
useless for meiosis clone here and so
you can see what we mean by filling out
our solution by the way so this is us
planning / filling it out we're writing
code hoping that we have functions later
but we don't so this check squares
function I'm going to tell you in
advance
it took me a long time to figure out so
if I have a grid and I'm gonna call this
a grid that's loops 9 by 9 and the
reason I'm gonna do that tend to
distinguish its pseudo cou grid from the
grid of squid the squares which are 3 by
3 so how am I going to check the scores
so let's see let's go back to what our
data looks like you know there's a few
ways we could do this I think what I
want to do is I want to first get this
in square form and what is square 4 I'm
gonna look like well that's a good
question I think I'm gonna think of this
as
a role here we're gonna have like a row
of three squares so the biggest list is
going to contain three rows with these
three ladies have these three squares
this is going to be the first one that
would be the second one and this would
be the third one then each of those
those three rows are gonna have three
squares so this one's going to have the
square that's falling here can I do I
don't know how to highlight that way but
it's gonna have this this and this then
each of the squares are gonna have rows
and H those rows are a have entries so
that's gonna be like a list of lists of
lists of lists if you didn't want to do
it that way there's enough there's other
ways to do it this is the way I want to
do it you can go as deep as you want you
can have as many lists inside of Lists
as you want and I I kind of like this
approach so how are we gonna do it to
you so we said that this flow grid is
made of rows of three squares so for row
of three squares remember each of the
squares is 30 by three in oh sorry
the grid is just a thing oh man I have
to make squares first huh
so I'm going to just try and convert
this grid this name and a grid into a
row of squares then for row for each of
the row I'm gonna have three squares in
each of those rows so I'm gonna iterate
over those squares or square and now I'm
gonna check that square so that Square
should be a 3x3 grid basically it should
look similar to this
let's just give you one example Sam
sample square would be something like 1
2 3 4 or 5 6 7 8 9 and that should that
would as just a square that way would be
bad so that's what when these squares
look like so I'm gonna do that thing
where I pretend a function so I'm gonna
do if check square notice that's just
single square there's no s on the end of
here so this is a different function and
I'm just gonna refer to this square it's
the same one so if that's false
it doesn't matter 1 2 1 squares bad
there are the whole puzzles bad I can
return false and if I've gotten through
every square in every row only then can
I return true ok this is a lot and I'm
not gonna keep going with this because I
know this is probably yeah this is hard
to follow at this point um the reason
I'm able to do this quickly is because
like I said I kind of thought about this
already but let me show you what my
solution code look like
okay um that looks similar check rose so
this was actually I had to change my
solution because I'm not really a fan of
pseudo ku
so actually earlier thought that the
only requirement was that the sum the
total of each row o had to be a certain
um plus T was super specific that's not
correct it actually needs one of each so
he said one of you yes I had to modify
this a little bit but let's let's go
with this it doesn't change the idea too
much I check columns looks a little
different you can see I've got these
print statements those are there because
if they had to debug this I didn't put
them in while I was solving it from
memory because I didn't need them I
remembered what the solution was and I
just gone through all these problems an
hour ago but these were here to show me
like where in the code things were
failing it wasn't working and I didn't
know why and I needed those down so my
check squares function okay so I call it
get squares instead of make squares but
similar sort of thing the check square
function it goes through each row and
that 3x3
well again remember this is me thinking
he just had to add up to some decided
some so this would require some
modification else return false and and
like for you for those of you who are a
little bit confusing we'll be sure to
post this yeah we're gonna definitely
put a little close this code along with
like like comments and like the way that
we're thinking so don't worry if you're
trying to feel really understand every
line of code
yeah yes just make sure that you're
understanding the bigger concept of like
here we are we are like this is what
that your concept it's right good common
sense yeah steps for solving a problem
basically that's that's the main thing
that we want you to give away from this
exercise yeah really so like Annie do
work have anything else to show for it
because I think it's I maybe I'm gonna
stop sharing my screen so I can look
actually okay we are broadcasting live
on this Afghan right now okay great yeah
so um we for sure post this code so you
could like follow along and follow along
the baking process that's the most
important thing and the main thing is
really succinctly we break things down
mm-hmm right handy yeah and let me we
have a little more time can I quickly
show you how how I would apply this
disclosure
oh yeah hold your ears Kocurek okay
we're good okay okay so if you've gone
to stage through stage two to work
session five let's just do this from
scratch
this applies so well to this last
problem where what was the problem of
this January concert mr. moon I reset
this okay so this is where I wanted to
I'm just going to get rid of all this I
want to write a function called make
HTML from any concepts because what I
wanted to do was I want to stop having
copy and paste my divs I want to be able
to specify my the the concepts I wanted
in my notes in one place and just modify
that instead of having to keep modifying
my actual HTML file by copy
tasting which is error-prone so for
example let's say I had ups so I'm just
going to keep these very minimal for
illustration and then maybe it had
another entry that was HTML I'll do
stands for hypertext language okay so
these are this is my my choice of data
structure it's called for how I want to
represent concepts each concept is a
list each list has a title you get it
sorry I'm sorry
oh no has a title and the description
title description and so applying the
same thought process to solving sort of
this problem I would say like all right
let's do def what was it called make
HTML form any comments many concepts and
that's gonna take concept I'm just
calling something different to
distinguish it from this even though I'm
eventually going to call this function
with this argument this is this can be
tricky there's a lot of stuff floating
around but I'm gonna just call it
concept list okay so what do I want to
do so first I want to iterate over this
big list that's in green in green right
now so I'm going to do for concept and
in concept list mmm no I'm making a
chain now I want that as a string sex
you have to remember I'm gonna first
start with an empty string I'm gonna
just keep adding to that so let's say
what are we gonna add I'm gonna add each
team and that's gonna equal whatever the
previous HTML was which right now is
this but remember it's not always gonna
be this as we loop through we're gonna
be making this bigger and bigger so I'm
gonna call this function make HTML for
concept if rows actually called and
that's gonna take a single concept
that's a fun Esav are you in there
forcing the concept is a list like that
then I'm going to return HTML so that
looks pretty simple right this code is
nice and readable I know I have to go
and find or create and make HTML for
concept but I can go through I can read
through this and sort of get what's
going on and somebody else could too
even if that someone else is you in a
week because it can often be hard to
read your code a week later now I need
to make this function I just want to
like do a little commentary SS andis
codings like Manny's actually breaking
things down he's actually doing this
exercise called pseudocode and he's
actually thinking and writing down as he
types and he's actually breaking things
down and actually creating these
functions and named them in a way that
makes make sense in the regular English
language thanks for doing that cuz I
have a lot of just boilerplate code to
write so yeah he can keep riffing this
egg's great yeah exactly so basically
like really it's like it's it's a really
good way for you to start thinking like
okay how can I transfer what's in my
head what's on paper and then what's on
paper to something that the computer
program could actually go and and
understand so the first step is to think
about again like understand the bigger
issue like what is the question what is
it that we're trying to do what are the
inputs that we're getting and what are
the outputs that we're supposed to make
really if you think if you think of it
it's just really like you are like
basically the machine right you you
program the machine to take some sort of
input some sort of raw input it does is
magic and then it outputs the the thing
that you want the the string or some
sort of result that you want so it's
good to really just sit down and think
back and zoom out what Annie often does
and really think about okay what are the
ins inputs word outputs and what are the
required transformations that I need to
do to transform this raw input into this
output
thank you yes great okay so I think we
can go over this code a bit so here I
define what the HTML is for given
concept and so first I have this div
that captures everything it has a class
of concept inside of that there's a div
with the class of concept - title and
here actually you know I don't like this
I don't like this concept of zero I know
that if I come back to this in a week
I'm gonna forget where that comes from
so let me just do title equals concept
zero here we go what Andy is doing is
actually a very important best practices
that we to find our T's helper variables
that instead of just accessing this
array directly we actually give it
another name
basically like title description
description so we know exactly
conceptually what we're trying to do yes
so that previous code will report
yeah but working isn't always enough
it's it's I mean it's enough for the
computer but there's two people involved
in making the code and you are one of
them and you're gonna want to do this
again the week and it's gonna be much
you're gonna love yourself if you just
were nice enough to give things very
descriptive names yeah I love to affect
that and you saying program for your
future self I often tell my students
that like listen you need to program for
your future self and make your future
self love you like in the present so now
in theory if I call this function on
list with list of concepts as an input
it should return some HTML so let's do
that
make HTML for many concepts and what was
that list of concepts there's talking
also and we need to print this out right
because this result is yes yes return
just let's just actually let's just show
what happens if you don't
yeah this is one of the most fresh oh
there's no dressing our global single no
so that's fine where was single okay I
called this single concept but I was
calling it in the for loop just concept
yeah it's just concept so I'm gonna just
call it okay no didn't display any
output yeah there's nothing you don't
know how many times I've looked at that
put message for four hours before I
realized that this function was
returning something but return isn't
quite the same as print I need to print
yeah
and sure enough when I do that nice it
looks pretty nice look at that Auto
generated HTML code and now I mean in
theory I could just keep track of all my
notes up here and as I add new notes so
like let's say I learned something new
about like I don't know let's say I
learned about Torah I'm going to learn
about object-oriented programming
object-oriented this is what you learn
in course three programming is the best
and that should go now
instead of having to copy and paste boom
there you go yeah I've got a nice HTML
it's already properly for awesome
that's the value of avoiding repetition
also we're screening or we're back to
beautifully everyone saw some really
good framework some some true
programming programming way of thinking
we have a couple questions
oh yeah yeah we have a couple minutes
next with us so miss that so the first
one it was most highly elbowed is I'm
late coming to office hours can tell me
where can I get the recording for this
one snip and all of the ones in the past
so basically after this office hours has
been is finished Google will actually
automatically record this video so what
you need to do is just after we end the
session to go back to the same page
refresh your page and then you can
actually start from start playing at the
beginning so all office our sessions
will be on the Google events site as
well as in the discussion forum so we
after every office hours we go into the
discussion forums and actually post
linked to specific after summer sessions
as well as links to the code than you
wrote so this one is yeah Joshua has
another question is please post this
code and the rationale if your Python
thick
please tell us where it is posted so
once again we will post these on the
discussion forum the code itself so
watch out for that either tonight or
tomorrow and you could actually go ahead
and go through the code and actually try
to code a line-by-line way to any tips
though you can actually really think the
not the way to him and he did so I need
to have a knee I mean that side of
thinking takes practice to know I
remember I first saw this in ESD class
called design of computer programs an
expert programmer named Peter Norvig in
a blew my mind that he was thinking this
way but I love the way of thinking and I
loved it enough to stick with trying it
out but I really it was hard at first to
write write code for functions that
didn't exist but with practice you can
you'll get it yeah so this is a great
way to just think of heaven like
structure and avoid details make sure
you have your big picture solution make
sense before you and all this time and
energy writing the detailed solutions
okay great let's like this question is
it true I can use sublime to to write
Python code sorry for very explain down
yes it's absolutely true Canadian yeah
go ahead you are a screen share all
right so let's let's do a new file with
your sibling text so I did file new file
so right now if you look up on this
tabby to see untitled so the first thing
you need to do so that I can actually
code in Python and save this file as I'm
gonna save in my desktop as example code
like that that name doesn't matter what
matters is what's called the extension
so I saved as example code dot py and
that tells tells any program that knows
about Python hey this is a Python file
treat it like a Python file I know when
I write something like death it becomes
blue def my function and none of my
function is green and the arguments are
gonna be um orange I guess this is
really nice this syntax highlighting and
it's something that you get because
sublime understands
understands that this is this is Python
if you want to run this code you can go
to project or sorry um visit tools it's
actually build and although I think
Crimes Commission what Saturn I didn't
know your they actually called Yaga this
function doesn't do anything with its
inputs it's a pretty terrible function
but that's okay and sure enough there's
hello shows up in the bottom so you can
totally do that and that's a good way to
code if you know if you're if you're
struggling with using this is a better
place to code than in the Udacity window
that I showed you earlier okay
but the audacity window is good for you
know short little functions but this is
nicer because the syntax highlighting is
a little better and a few other reasons
great thanks for the question Joshua
Roberta had a more of a comment and it's
very valid Kyle I've been watching it
from the beginning but I'm afraid I'm
lost this is getting way more complex
than this subject to concert fun to
watch done well I'm glad it was fun to
watch at least honestly I I should have
put my foot into the choice of example I
think this you Doku own got pretty
complicated pretty quick I think if
you're gonna take away anything from
this it was writing this function so
your spacer I gonna oh yeah it was that
I wrote this function check sodoku
before I wrote these functions I said I
don't know what check Rose is gonna look
like I don't know how I'm gonna write
check columns I don't know how I'm gonna
write check squares but I know that if
it passes all these tests if my pseudo
grid passes check rose and it passes
check columns and it passes check
squares I want to return true and that's
basically the whole program mm-hmm I
should just said otherwise but that to
me was was the the big takeaway here
when you have a really big problem try
and chop it up into the biggest pieces
you can at first and then for each of
those pieces chop them up as big as you
can and keep doing that and eventually
you'll get down to something where you
don't need to chop it up anymore or you
just sort of write a single function and
or you know you
I had a single function and you're good
to go yeah so Roberta yeah if you were
gonna be posting this code and once you
have what you're free feel free to go
through this code and if you have any
questions on this particular code post
it up on the discussion forum and we'll
be more than happy to help you walk
through the code as well the last
question of today will be from Matt I'm
not oh yeah yeah are you familiar with
BBEdit I'm not so Matt your question is
sublime text first BBEdit yeah um if you
I assume BBEdit is a text editor I
honestly don't know assuming it supports
Python and it's good the features you
need you should use whatever text editor
you like I really like sublime that's
what I started using when I've learned
to code and so it's just easy for me to
continue using that um but yeah use
whatever tools you want yeah so I'll
I'll just preface that like sublime is
very good a lot of people the office
uses it other people also use other text
editors like notepad plus plus that's
actually a decent one another one would
be think Eclipse Eclipse is more
heavy-duty okay or how to do it just
simple text editors would like add on
more brackets oh yeah things like that
so like you can actually just really
really just look up under it and
basically just type in like top top five
text editors or Python and yeah make it
less you're gonna get a lot of articles
research and you know if you if you
don't have any if you're wondering what
this conversations all about use sublime
for now if you don't have any preference
if you never used a programming
environment it's gonna be easier to just
use sublime because that's what we're
gonna be using throughout the course so
it'll just look more familiar and be a
little easier so yeah stick with that
okay great so we're at 4:46 so officers
are adding our live posting like session
has ended uh and if you have any final
thoughts for our students
no I hope you enjoyed this and remember
if you can take away anything else you
can break big things into smaller pieces
even if you haven't smelled solve those
small pieces yet great
all right people if you have a further
questions
for follow-ups post in discussion forums
it's there for you to reach out to us
Andy and I as well as your field
students all right so next week we'll
have another office hour session and
same time same day and we hope to see
you next week bye bye everyone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
