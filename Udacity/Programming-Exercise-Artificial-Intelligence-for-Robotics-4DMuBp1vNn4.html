exercise and I want you to program
exactly what we just talked about we're
given a two-dimensional world where you
observe in 2d measurements of a moving
object with an unknown but fixed
velocity and using a state vector of
this type
I'd like you to implement the common
filter now this common filter now has
four state variables whereas the one we
used before has two state variables I
will give you the entire code for the
common filter but I want you to set up
the state vector X the motion u P F H R
and I which are all those variables that
define the common phaedra start with the
assignment that we had in 2d and make it
work in 40 so here's exactly the same
matrix class that I wrote you before he
is the common filter procedure we'll go
through our measurements and apply the
common field equations I should point
out there is a slight difference to the
code I gave you previously for I
inserted 0 transpose it makes a little
bit easier to work with
multi-dimensional measurements they
never had it before but you don't have
to pay attention but this is just fixed
there was a kind of a bug before and as
I scroll down the output of the common
filter routine will be an X and a P in
our example the measurements will be a
sequence of measurements in
two-dimensional space is now in X&amp;amp;Y look
at the XS 5 6 7 8 9 10 the Y is called
10 8 6 4 2 you can imagine what the
regularity is and what the velocity is
we assume a DT of 0.1 that means when it
goes from 5 to 6 the loss is actually 10
not 1 but we won't tell the system but
we will tell the system our initial XY
location which is 4 that goes less into
5 6 7 and it's 12 that blends nicely
eight and six our initial state vector
already given you which is the initial x
and y and zero zero for the two unknown
velocities and the motion vector just
for completeness will just be zero zero
zero zero
we have no external motion let's a bit
confusing because there's actually a
motion in the system itself but this
will be more like an external change of
the motion it says someone hit the
object with next ternal force so it's
zero zero zero zero please don't change
it P is the initial uncertainty and I
want you to initialize it so that the
uncertainty for the XY coordinates is
zero but the covariance term for the
velocities is 1,000 indicating that we
don't know the initial velocity we just
know the initial position I want you to
plug in the F matrix I want you to
design an H matrix that's a projection
matrix from four dimensional state space
to two dimensions reflecting the fact
that you can only observe the first two
state variables x and y but not the
velocities I want you to define a
measurement uncertainty matrix which now
is a two by two that has zero point one
and semane diagonal as measurement noise
and this is an identity matrix over here
once you design all those you should get
the following output so when I run this
I get as an output from a four
dimensional example the x coordinates
ten and zero and this makes sense given
that these sequences over here head is a
final measurement 10 and 0 5 6 7 8 9 10
10 8 6 4 2 0 the interesting thing that
I want your program to produce is the
velocities they are approximately 10
which makes sense give them a delta T of
0.1 gives us per time step a 10 divided
by 10 equals 1 increment over here and
the second velocity is minus 20
multiplied by 0.1 gives us a minus 2 and
you can see it over here ten eight six
four and two I also want you to output
the covariance matrix just certain off
elements that are still zero
these guys over here if we find that
along the main diagonal our uncertainty
has shrunk substantially it's zero point
zero three for the coordinate estimates
in 0.1 for the velocity estimates
remember this number over here was a
thousand before here's the second
example with an initial coordinate of
minus four and eight you can see the
measurements 1 6 11 16 it seems the
increments are in X Direction 5 inviting
erection there - 4 8 4 0 - 4 - 8 if I
now run this I get for my X vector this
a box min is 16 and I'm over here
approximate is 8 then I'm over here and
these are velocities 50 and minus 40 in
approximation which multiplied with 0.1
is our plus 5n our - 4 he has yet
another example initial state 1 and 19
you can see the first quotient doesn't
change at all you should get a velocity
of 0 the second coordinate was in 1917
15 13 11 running us gives us 1 unchanged
and 11 velocities are 0 and minus 24 the
decrement of -2 and going into the
covariance we see values along the main
diagonals 0.05 0.05 0.33 and 0.33 for
the raza T's there are certain off
diagonal elements make sure those all
match what you what your code produces I
can now change some of these
measurements to make a noisy measurement
one way to do this is to set an
oscillating measurement between 2 and 0
remember that this common filter assumes
the fixed velocity there's no way to
explain these measurements by the fixed
velocity so let's be measurement noise
so we can run the common filter again
your filter to output the following
values 0.7 for the current state 11 as
before and here are 2 lost the estimates
Leslie believes there's a slight
velocity of minus 0.66 in the X
direction where we had noisy sensor
input
the covariance matrix should look
exactly as before because it's not
affected by the measurements themselves
so your job is to fill in these various
matrices good luck</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
