and so ubiquitous and also to understand
what exactly is classification let us go
back to our overall cognitive
architecture for an intelligent agent
this is a diagram that we have come
across many many times let us imagine
this particular cognitive system is
dealing with a set of percepts these
perception in the world so as an example
this cognitive system may see some
object some animal when the cognitive
system goes to the zoo this might be an
air agent or perhaps your friend who
goes to the zoo and looks at some
animals and there are a large number of
percepts in that environment has wings
has feathers talons beak and so on and
for the simplicity let's assume that
each of this project is binary it's
either true or false so either the
animal has wings or doesn't have wings
depending upon the percept and the
combinations of these percepts one might
take different kind of actions so if
it's a friendly animal one might go and
pet it if it's a unfriendly or dangerous
animal one might run away from it so all
kind of actions are possible imagine
that there are some M actions that are
possible so we can again imagine that
there is a binary choice here so the
total number of combinations of actions
as 2 to the power M so as an example if
I have a if I see a dangerous animal in
the zoo then I might both scream and run
away if I see a friendly animal I may
approach the animal and make cooing
noise to the animal so a number of
actions and combinations of actions are
possible and if n is the number of
percepts then I have to do the power n
combinations of percepts possible so
here is the challenge to the cognitive
aging faces the challenges that the
number of perception the number of
actions more precisely number of
combinations of percepts and the number
of combinations of actions is very very
large and we have to map these percepts
combinations of perception these
combinations of actions this is a very
complex mapping so imagine the only ten
percepts in the immediate environment so
i'm looking at a animal and there are
let's take ten percepts that i am paying
attention
then 2 to the power 10 the number
combinations of perceptions 1024 I'm
doing the 2 to the power 10 here because
I'm assuming that each percept has a
binary value if i had a hundred percept
I was not looking at one animal but I
was looking at a scene of animals then I
may have 100 percepts in which case I
have a much larger number of
combinations and if I have something
like 300 percept which is still not a
very large number the number of
combinations is well it's a very large
number more than the combinations of
atoms in the universe now you and I and
AI agents for generally a constantly
faced with complex environment in which
there are large number of perception a
large number of actions that are
possible so let's go back to something
earlier that we had considered at the
class we defined earlier that one way of
talking about intelligent agencies to
think in terms of how can an intelligent
agent map percepts into actions
intelligences in part a large part
perhaps accorded this definition about
action selection the other aspect of
this is that the number of percepts is
large in the number of actions is large
then the mapping between them becomes
very large and very complicated quickly
but intelligent agents have only finite
resources how is it then that we can
select the right action or at least most
of the time select the right action even
when the environment is very complex and
do so in near real-time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
