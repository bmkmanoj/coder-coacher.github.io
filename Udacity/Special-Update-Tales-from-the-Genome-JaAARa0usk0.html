about their motivations for having or
not having personal genetic information
we want to update you on some news
surrounding 23andme and the health
reports that they offer through their
kids and that you're going to see a peer
later in this lesson on November 22nd
2013 the united states food and drug
administration or the fda sent a letter
to 23andme requesting that they abstain
from providing personalized health
reports based on genetic data without
full government approval now here's how
this might affect you in our course
throughout this lesson you'll see
examples of Health reports from 23andme
if you purchased a 23 Emmy camp after
November 22nd then you're not going to
see these types of Health reports in
your account so don't be alarmed however
if your kit was purchased before
november 22nd then you're still going to
have access to these health reports
there are other reports from 23 meet
including your ancestry background which
we also cover in this lesson that
everyone still has access to now Matt is
there anything that people can do if
they still want to learn about their
health information based on their
genetics and they still want to use our
23andme kit so actually yes there is
although some of you won't have access
to the full 23 Emmy help report 23 and
we still provide you with your raw
genetic data that can be downloaded from
their site all you have to do is
download this and take the information
to a third party site to figure out what
these individual snv's mean you can look
in the instructors notes on this page
for a list of these links and more
information about how to go about that
also well for now let's go look at some
interviews about the personal
motivations for genetic testing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
