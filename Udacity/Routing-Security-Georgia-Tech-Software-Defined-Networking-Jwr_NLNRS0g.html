Morris jr. in 1988 the worm itself had
no malicious payload but it ended up
bogging down the machines that it
infected by spawning new processes
uncontrollably in exhausting resources
at the time it was released it affected
10% of all internet hosts it spread
through three different propagation
vectors the worm tried to crack
passwords using a small dictionary and a
publicly readable password file and also
targeted hosts that were already listed
in a trusted host file on the machine
that was already infected this ability
to perform remote execution was one way
that the worm was allowed to spread the
second way that it spread was in a
buffer overflow of vulnerability in the
finger demon this was a standard buffer
overflow exploit and if you don't know
about buffer overflows I would urge you
to take a computer security course but
essentially this is a very common attack
that makes remote exploits possible
effectively resulting in the ability to
run arbitrary code at the root level
privilege the third way that the worm
spread was via the debug command in send
mail which is a mail sending service in
early send mail versions it was possible
to execute a command on a remote machine
by sending an SMTP message the worm used
this capability to spread automatically
a key theme that we'll see in the design
of other worms is this use of multiple
vectors now any particular worm may end
up using a different set of vectors
depending on the remote vulnerabilities
that it's trying to exploit but the idea
that any worm should be able to exploit
multiple weaknesses in a system gives it
more ways to spread and often also
speeds up the propagation of the worm
this worm design also followed the
following general approach which we see
showing up over and over again
in warm designs first the warm needs to
scan other hosts to find potentially
vulnerable hosts in the second step it
needs to spread by infecting other
vulnerable hosts and in the third step
it needs to remain undiscoverable and
undiscovered so that it can continue to
operate and spread without being removed
from systems</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
