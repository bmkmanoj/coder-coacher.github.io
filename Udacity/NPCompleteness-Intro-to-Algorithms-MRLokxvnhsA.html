when we when we say that a problem is
np-complete is the NP completeness
equation which says that np-complete
means that a problem is in NP and it's
np-hard
alright so based on that knowing that
graph partitioning is np-complete means
yes indeed graph partitioning is np-hard
and based on what we said about NP
hardness that means a polynomial time
solution to graph partitioning would
solve everything in NP we also know
specifically that any problem like gleek
that we know is in NP can be reduced to
it so a solution to graph partitioning
would solve clique specifically from
this part of the NP completeness
equation we know that graph partitioning
is in NP and from what we know about NP
that means an exponential time solution
exists to graph partitioning and that it
can be reduced to Sat if somebody could
solve Sat for us that would also let us
solve graph partitioning because graph
partitioning sin n pink so we actually
know all of these things by virtue of
the fact that graph partitioning
is np-complete
