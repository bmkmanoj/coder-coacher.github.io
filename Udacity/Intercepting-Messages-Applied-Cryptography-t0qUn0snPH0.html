1941 in August 1941 the Allies had a big
break so an operator was sending a
message using a Lorenz cipher starting
with the initial configuration and these
configurations came from code books the
recipients at the other end needed to
know what the configuration for that day
was but these could be distributed
securely and were much smaller than
needing to distribute the whole key
sequence once you have the starting
configuration you could transmit an
arbitrarily large message if this
assumption that the key was completely
unpredictable was true in this case the
operator sent a message the receiver did
not receive it so the receiver said
garbled transmission please resend and
so the annoyed operator had to send the
message again over the secure Channel
and this time it was received okay if
this is exactly what happened it would
have been fine these would be exactly
the same we restarted the machine in the
same configuration but what happened was
a little different the operator got a
little lazy the second time the operator
was annoyed having to re transmit the
message so instead of sending exactly
the same message sent a slightly
different message that meant that there
was a slightly different ciphertext than
we had the previous time and both of
these messages were intercepted so that
means the Allies now had access to both
C and C Prime they didn't know anything
about the key they didn't know anything
about the original messages well maybe
they knew a little bit about the
original messages and that's what's
going to help them given these two
ciphertext figure out both the key and
once they have the key the structure of
the lorentz so what is the result of
exhorting these two messages and that
means for each bit we're gonna go
through the bits the message is
exhorting each bit and I'm going to
introduce a new variable here so the key
that the machine generates will call K
that's the key that the Machine
generates starting from configuration C
zero so which one of these is the
value that the Interceptor would get by
X whoring the two intercepted cipher
