key ideas to make this work and one of
them is the simulation lemma the idea
the simulation lemma is that if we have
a pretty good estimate of the real MVP
then optimizing our rewards in that
estimate is going to be pretty good in
the real MVP this is a limo about
simulations not a simulation of a limo
that's right it's not a simulated lemma
it's a it's a lemma about simulation
right and so the the idea is that we've
got transitions and rewards that are off
by alpha or less and we want to think
about what happens if we adopt some
policy pi any policy pot we're going to
compare the value that we get for
following pie in mdp one that has
transition function T 1 and reward
function R 1 to the value that we get
the return that we get for following
policy pie in mb b 2 which has
transition function T 2 and reward are
two ok and if if those are going to be
near each other given that t1 is near on
t 2 and r 1 is near are two then that's
going to give us the ability to have
accurate simulations right we can use
our model of the MVP to simulate what's
going to happen in the real MVP and just
to be concrete this is what i mean by
the transition functions reward
functions not being too different that
we have this value alpha and if we take
the maximum over stall state action next
date triples that the probability
assigned by transition function t 1 and
the probability assigned by transition
function t to our note not different by
more than alpha and same thing with the
reward so that's a little weird how so
well because the transition model is
probability so that can't ever be off by
more than one sure and the rewards could
be like gigantic numbers that could be
off by billions sure billions and
billions so it seems a little weird you
feel like it should be two different
alphas yeah alpha T and alpha R but
maybe not yeah i mean i didn't want to
proliferate variables when we didn't
really need to but you're right the
scale of these could be very different I
mean a lot of times in the proofs that
people use for these kinds of MVPs they
first assume that rewards are actually
all in the range 0 to 1 also doesn't
change the fact that you still might
want a different alpha for the two cases
but it does at least get the scale more
really correct ok so then without loss
of generality assumed that all your
awards are between minus 1 and 1 or 0
nline or 0 and 1 why not because you
know it's all the same mdp yeah they
look more like probabilities or
something ok cool so without loss of
generality assume that your rewards are
between 0 and 1 and your transition
probabilities which would have to be
here between 0 and 1 so that we can use
the same alpha and everything kind of
works out again it still might be worth
having different alphas but but yeah
you're right i mean again it puts us in
the in the right ballpark ok so these
are ballpark office so this is a ball
park simulation lemma I'm perfectly fine
with that that is now we're out of the
ballpark so that's either a vacuum
cleaner or a metal detector or it's a
gigantic baseball being knocked out of a
apart yet was supposed to be a ballpark
but down now it looks to me more like
some kind of terrible cruel alien I
don't with I don't know it is anyway the
point is that it's clits alpha close to
a reasonable picture and that's alpha ok</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
