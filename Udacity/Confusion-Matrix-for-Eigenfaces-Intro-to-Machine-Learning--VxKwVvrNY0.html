different context you might remember the
work that Katie showed you on principle
component analysis on PCA where we
looked at seven different guess
white male politicians from George Bush
to Aurora and we went an eigen phase
analysis extracting the principal
components of the dataset and then reuse
the eigenfaces to remap new faces to
names in order to identify people so
what I'm gonna do now is I won't drag
you through the same pca example against
let's do away with those faces
but instead what I'll do is I'll give
you a typical output and we're gonna
study the output using confusion
matrices so Katie was so nice as to run
a PCA on the faces of those politicians
and then take the resulting features put
into a support vector machine and then
go through the data and count how often
any of those people were predicted
correctly or misclassified and just to
confuse everybody in this example we
follow the convention of putting the
true names the true class labels on the
left and the predicted ones on top so
for example this number one over here
was truly Donald Rumsfeld or was
mistaken to be Colin Powell and the way
I know it's Colin Powell was the same
names over here from Ariel Sharon to
Tony Blair apply to the columns over
here for Ariel Sharon's on the left and
Tony Blair's on the right so we ask you
a few questions now first a simpler one
which of those seven politicians was
most frequent in our data set</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
