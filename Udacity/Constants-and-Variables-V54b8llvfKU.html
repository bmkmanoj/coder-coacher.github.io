open the file lesson1 constants and
variables it's another playground file
in Swift there are two different ways to
assign a name to a value values can be
assigned to constants or variables
constants are declared using the keyword
let and variables are declared using the
keyword bar not surprisingly once the
value of a constant is set it can't be
reassigned the value remains constant so
one should use let when assigning a
value that's not expected to change here
the encouragment string stays the same
so it's declared as a constant the
personalized encouragement string
changes so it's declared as a variable
here's another example birth year
doesn't change but time keeps
progressing forward so current year does
change as does age if age is defined as
current year - birth year but it's
important to keep in mind that context
matters as well
the previous example assumes that the
variable age is going to be calculated
multiple times if age was only intended
to be calculated once then we'd go ahead
and declare age and current year as
constants
when in doubt declare a constant over a
variable anytime a value is altered it
should be explicit this protects our
code from inadvertently changing values
that we don't want changed let's do one
more example for good measure
here birth weight isn't going to change
so we'll declare that as a constant but
current weight is going to change so we
declare that as a variable</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
