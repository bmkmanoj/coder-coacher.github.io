problems we've had yet also one of the
toughest thinking problems let's
actually start at the second part of the
wording here if the allelic frequency of
the phenylketonuria recessive allele is
point 0 1 point 0 1 so we've got 300,000
people so if we have 300,000 people
right I'm sorry not 300,000 but 300
million people how many alleles is that
that's a total of six hundred million
alleles remember everybody has two
copies of every gene to two alleles
that's two times three hundred million
people is 600 million alleles so what's
the allelic frequency how many alleles
that cause phenylketonuria exists out of
the six hundred million point oh one
would be six million so we have a total
of six million alleles that cause
phenylketonuria total in this entire
population all right well now let's look
back at the first part we know that
roughly one and every 10,000 newborn
babies has be no kitchen area so one in
10,000 of the 300 million here is what
we can estimate so one 10,000 of 300
million is 30,000 affected individuals
right so this population 30,000 are
affected that means they must be minus
minus their homozygous so that means
there are 60,000 affected alleles we
know that there's six million affected
phenylketonuria alleles in this
population of 600 million alleles on the
whole population 60,000 are already
accounted for by the affected
individuals so six million minus sixty
thousand leaves five million nine
hundred and forty thousand alleles right
five million nine or ten affected
alleles and because we've already
accounted all of the affected people
these must all be in the unaffected
people people who are carriers so this
means that there are approximately five
million nine hundred and forty thousand
people who are carriers of the
phenylketonuria allele hopefully that
wasn't too difficult you do have to
think sort of laterally in a couple ways
you have to work through this but
hopefully this logic makes sense if
you're still having trouble go to the
forums and talk to your fellow students
and I'll try to address some of your
concerns there as well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
