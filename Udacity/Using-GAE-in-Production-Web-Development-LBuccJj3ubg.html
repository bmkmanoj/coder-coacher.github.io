this is basically just kind of a wrap-up
and any last questions that we saw that
we felt needed to be answered before the
end of the course right yep yep okay so
let's just jump right in first question
was when if you were building rhetoric
Hipmunk today would you build it on
Google App Engine huh or would you go
ahead and okay sure sure sure okay so
that's a really good question and the
short answer is I'm not sure I think we
could build reddit or hipmunk on Google
App Engine and I'd probably definitely
hit monk a site that I know is you know
because it's a travel site it's never
going to be at the scale that read it is
because even the biggest travel sites
aren't anywhere near the scale that read
it is yeah so I would have no problem
doing that now read it it's funny
because when i started reddit we didn't
expect it to be a big site and i was
actually my level of knowledge was less
than where yours is now so App Engine
would have saved us a lot of heartache
now for the scale that reddit is now I
don't know if App Engine would work so
we because because it's that such a
large scale we need to have control over
a lot of little pieces but I think for
the first couple of years of reddits
life absolutely it would have worked is
fine and over the over reddits existence
we've rewritten it probably five or six
times and moved a couple data centers
and we move you know from our own
machines to our first data center to two
now we're on amazon web services and
each of that was a pretty major
architecture change so i mentioned we
probably would consider starting with
App Engine and then probably migrate to
our own more custom setup down the road</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
