understand what it is about the way that
the Russian algorithm is designed that
makes it so much better than the naive
approach that's just repetitive addition
let's just go back for a moment to what
multiplication is at least integer
multiplication it is repeated addition
eight times B and let's focus for the
moment on the case where a is even can
be written as b + b + bleep of be
repeated a times we're considering a
case where a is even here we can regroup
things as two sums be added to itself a
over two times and then be added to
itself a over two times again and those
two things added together but it's silly
to compute the same thing twice
so really if we're doing this
calculation we could just compute at
once be added to itself a over two times
and then just double the result that we
get doing this calculation here is
basically now repeating the same
operation over again so each time we're
doing part of the sum here we're
actually saving ourselves a tremendous
amount of effort the idea of divide and
conquer is that you can break a problem
into roughly equal sized subproblems
solve the subproblems separately and
combine the results and in this
particular instance the subproblems
themselves these these two sums are
identical so that only has to be done
once so you're saving yourself half the
effort every time that you do this half
keeps compounding and that's how we get
down to a logarithmic number of steps
instead of a linear number of steps so
this way of looking at the Russian
peasants algorithm leads to a very
interesting way of expressing the
algorithm recursively the idea here is
that what we're going to do is to
multiply a and B together what we're
going to do is say if a is zero to start
we can just return zero and be done with
it on the other hand if a is even then
just because of the derivation that we
just worked at a moment ago multiplying
a times B is really the same thing as
adding B to itself a over two times so
it's a over two times B which we're
going to compute recursively so the
Russian algorithm is going to go off and
do whatever it does compute a over two
times B and once we have the answer to
that we need to multiply that by two to
get the answer to the original problem
so we can use a solution to this
subproblem to solve the big problem in
the case where it's odd it's a little
bit more complicated pull one of the B's
out we're actually adding a B's together
but a is odd so let's pull one of the
B's out and add to that well what's left
there's a minus one repetitions of B
they were adding together but a minus
one is now
so we can have that compute what a minus
one over two times B is recursively once
we have the answer to that we can
multiply it by two well it's going to
give us what a minus one times B is
which is a times B minus B so we just
add the B back in and we should be good
so using the solution to this
sub-problem we can compute the solution
to the original problem so this maybe
seems a little bit circular but each
time that the Russian peasant algorithm
is being called here it's being called
with a much smaller value 1/2 as bit as
it was before and that's where we're
getting a lot of our mileage from let's
actually analyze this algorithm it's
going to be the same answer as what we
got for the Russian peasant algorithm
but it's going to introduce a new tool
that's going to be helpful for us
analyzing lots of other algorithms</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
