index and ranks are represented is
through the outputs so the crawl web
procedure outputs two things an index
and a ranks list both of those are
represented as dictionaries the index
maps a keyword to list of URLs and the
ranks Maps a URL to its rank score in
the search module a procedure like lucky
search depends on getting both of those
things as inputs so this is quite a
complex dependency and this is the kind
of thing that makes it much harder to
maintain code it makes it much harder to
understand code and it makes it much
harder to change the code if we decide
to change something about the crawler
well we've got to worry about all these
procedures in search that use these
outputs so our goal is to hide all that
complexity in general the way we hide
things is to use abstraction abstraction
is about hiding details our goal is to
find a way to restructure the code so we
don't need to know all those details and
that's a form of abstraction abstraction
is all about hiding details what we want
is an abstract object that the crawler
creates that has the properties search
needs to be able to do its work
but without search requiring to know the
details of how that's represented so our
goal is to replace all this with one
abstract object we'll call that a web
corpus and that will be the output of
the crawler and the input to the search
and we'll end up defining this web
corpus object in a new module what this
is is actually a new type and Python
provides a way to define new types
they're called classes before we get
into how to create our own type like the
web corpus type that we need here we're
going to step back and learn more about
how types work in Python</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
