disinhibitory effect this disinhibition
means that people are going to do things
when they're drinking that they wouldn't
normally do that's what we mean by risky
behaviors when people are intoxicated
they'll do things they wouldn't do when
they're sober this can be why people get
into so much trouble when they've been
drinking
people can't think clearly and they act
inappropriately to their impulses they
also think in the here and now and they
don't necessarily think about the future
or consequences that could lead to a lot
of trouble but for now let's switch
gears and let's go talk to Susan about
the effect alcohol has in the body</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
