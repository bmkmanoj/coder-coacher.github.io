the pseudocode and find that it first
sets some and count to zero that's
already there these lines are the same
as what we had before for computing the
sum of every other digit before each
digit starting from the right part is
getting pretty familiar now I'll keep
the code for controlling the number of
iterations in place but now instead of
just always adding digit to the sum I
need to check whether the count is even
or odd and before I even get the digit
I'll want to make sure I remember to
increment count now if count is odd I
add the digit to the sum otherwise count
is even and if the digit is less than
five I add twice the digit to the sum in
the last case count is even and the
digit is greater than five and I want to
add twice the digit and then subtract
nine this is all just matching that
pseudocode now instead of just returning
false I need to return whether the last
digit of n is zero or not the last digit
of n is zero when sub mod 10 is zero for
example if some were 24 then some 10
would be 4 which is not 0 and the card
would not be valid but if sum is 40 then
sum mod 10 is 0 and the card is valid so
this would return true looks like I
forgot to change my pseudo code into
real code count is odd if count mod 2 is
1 and now I'll run the tester and it
looks like for at least the examples
that we've used my code is returning
true when true is expected and false
when false is expected here's some food
for thought does this guarantee that my
code is correct</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
