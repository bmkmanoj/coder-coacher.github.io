black box notice how we have multiple
operating systems running on the same
shared hardware resources now how is
this possible how are the operating
systems protected from one another and
who decides who gets the resource and at
what time what we need then is an
operating system of operating systems
something called a virtual machine
manager or hypervisor the terminology
that you will often encounter is either
VM M which stands for virtual machine
monitor a hypervisor and these operating
systems that are running on top of the
shared hardware resources are often
referred to as virtual machines of VM
for short
we've always been using the term VM to
mean virtual memory you have to do a a
mind shift for this lesson module VM
means virtual machine and each of these
operating systems that run on top of the
shared hardware resource I'll often
refer to them as either guest operating
systems of virtual machines or VM for
short so watch out now I should point
out that there are two types of
hypervisors the first type is what is
called a native hypervisor or bare-metal
meaning that the hypervisor is running
on top of the bare hardware and that's
why it's called a bare-metal hypervisor
or a native hypervisor and all of the
operating systems that I'm showing you
inside the black box are running on top
of this hypervisor
they call the guest operating systems
because they're the guests of the
hypervisor running on the shared
resource the second type of hypervisor
what is called the hosted hypervisor the
hosted ones run on top of a host
operating system and allows the users to
emulate the functionality of other
operating systems
so the hosted hypervisor is not running
on top of the bare metal but it is
running as an application process on top
of the host operating system and the
guest operating systems are themselves
clients of this hosted hypervisor some
examples of hosted hypervisors include
VMware Workstation and VirtualBox both
of these terminologies you may have
heard of if you don't have access to a
computer that's running Linux operating
system in this course you're likely to
be doing your course projects on a
virtual box or a VMware Workstation
that's available to run on Windows
platform for the purpose of this lesson
today however we will be focusing on the
bare metal hypervisors these bare metal
hypervisors interfere minimally with the
normal operation of these guest
operating systems on the shared
resources in a spirit which is very
similar to the extensible operating
systems that we studied earlier like the
spin and exokernel and therefore the
bare metal hypervisors offer the best
performance for the guest operating
system on a shared resource</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
