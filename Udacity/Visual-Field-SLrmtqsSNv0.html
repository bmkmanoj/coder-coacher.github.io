in your visual field so as you know
you've got two eyes well you start out
with two eyes for most of us each eye is
about a hundred and sixty degrees and
they overlap at about 120 degrees which
means if you do the math it means you
have about 200 degrees total field of
view different animals are different by
the way some animals the ones that are
prey is post predator their eyes are
back here so they have a wider field of
view that is they can see more behind
further behind them which you might want
to do if you're worried about a predator
but of course it means you have less
stereo vision but remember we were
talking about nerves coming out and
crossing this area called the optic
chiasm let's take a look at that a
little more carefully the human vision
system does well you're probably quite
familiar with your motor control system
right that the left part of your brain
controls the right arm and the right
part of your brain controls the left and
if you have a stroke on the left side of
your of your brain you'll you'll lose
some motor function also some sensory
function well you probably didn't stop
to think about that the eyes have a
tricky problem right so the stuff that I
see over here is seen in this I and in
this I and the stuff I see over here is
seen in this ayah and that I how does
the brain deal with that well the way it
does it is it actually splits the
eyeball and a half in terms of where the
projections come from so here we see the
right visual field which is looked at by
this left side of the eye which is the
temporal side of the left thigh and the
nasal side of the right eye though both
of those come in through the optic
chiasm going to the left side of your
brain so the left side of your brain is
looking at the stuff over here on the
right in both of the eyes okay and
likewise the right side of my right eye
and the right side of my left eye which
is looking at the stuff on the left hand
side is projected to the right hand side
of my brain and so just the same way
that your sensation on your right arm is
in your left brain the sensation in your
right visual field is at your left brain
also in this other view of the sort of
the projection of the
the system into the brain you can see
these other structures right so we get
here to the lateral geniculate again on
both sides projecting the superior
colliculus and here you can see that
there are these projections out to this
whole area of visual cortex which is in
the back and we'll look at that one of
the implications of this right half left
half right party brain looking at the
left half vice versa is if you have a
some sort of degeneracy or stroke or
something and let's say you were to lose
some function in one side of your brain
you would experience what's referred to
as here's written hemifield neglect okay
what that means is that so you got a
damaged let's say to your left side of
your brain the whole right side area we
just sort of not be there and what's
interesting and we'll see an example of
this in a minute when we talk about
blind spots and stuff you don't feel
like there's a hole there you just feel
like this is my field of view I don't
actually know what's over there okay so
it's not like right now I feel as a
whole back here despite what my wife
says there's no hole in the back of my
head I don't think but I just don't I
just know that I can't see what's back
there well what happens is if your brain
sort of starts not knowing what's over
here it just kind of you know it just
doesn't worry about it you know in fact
what'll happen is it'll fill in some
stuff for a little bit kind of like you
do the rest of your visual field we'll
talk about that in a minute too but but
I don't want you to get a sense that you
would feel like there was a great big
black hole sitting over there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
