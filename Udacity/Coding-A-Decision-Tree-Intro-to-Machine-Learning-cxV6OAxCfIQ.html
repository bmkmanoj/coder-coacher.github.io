your decision tree inside can't learn
now let me show you the decision tree
decision boundary that I got when I
tried this problem so here's what I got
and you can immediately see that the
decision tree decision boundary is very
distinctive get all these jagged little
lines it almost looks like you know a
piece of Modern Art or something it's
carving out all these horizontal and
vertical cuts that it makes because of
the structure of the decision tree where
it's running around trying to slice the
boundary in such a way that it can get
as many points as it can in the training
set you can see that it can also have
little little islands just like the SVM
did and in general this is the the shape
that's going to characterize a decision
tree or decision tree boundary one of
the things you might be noticing is that
there's some signs of overfitting
perhaps in this decision tree that we
have these long these long slices like
this one here and this one here where
the citizen tree seems to be kind of
going out of its way in an unnatural way
and I bet that if you plotted the
training points instead of the test
points on top of this decision boundary
you'd find that there's a few blue
training points that are maybe out along
here that are causing the decision
boundary to come way out and try to pick
those up and likewise for maybe some red
points over here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
