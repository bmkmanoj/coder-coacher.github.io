customization with a very specific
example and the example I'm going to
choose is memory management in
particular how an operating system
handles page faults let's say that this
thread executing on the processor incurs
a page fault the first thing that the
operating system has to do in order to
service this page fault would be to find
a free page frame to host the missing
page for this particular thread and once
it allocates a free page frame then the
operating system is going to initiate
the disk i/o to move the page from
virtual memory into the free page frame
that has been identified for hosting the
missing page of this particular thread
once the i/o is complete and the missing
page for this thread has been brought
from storage into this free page frame
the operating system is going to update
the page table for this thread or
process establishing the mapping between
the missing virtual page and the page
frame that has been allocated for
hosting that missing page once the page
table has been updated then we can
resume the process so that it can
continue where it left off at the point
of the page fault one thing that I
haven't told you in the sequence of
actions that the operating system takes
is that every so often the operating
system runs a page replacement algorithm
to free up some page frames in readiness
for allocating the frame to a page fault
that a process may incur just as an
airline over books its seats in the hope
that some passengers won't show up the
operating system is also over-committing
it's available physical memory hoping
that not all of the pages of a
particular process which is in the
memory footprint of the process will
actually be needed by the process during
its execution but how does the operating
system know what the memory access pad
of a particular process is going to be
in making this decision the short answer
is it does not
so whatever the operating system chooses
as an algorithm to implement page
replacement it may not always be the
most appropriate one for some class of
applications so here is an opportunity
for customization depending on the
nature of the application knowing some
details about the nature of the
application it might be possible to
customize the way page replacement
algorithm is handled by the operating
system similar opportunities for
customization exist in the way the
operating system schedules processes on
the processor and reacts to external
events such as interrupts and so on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
