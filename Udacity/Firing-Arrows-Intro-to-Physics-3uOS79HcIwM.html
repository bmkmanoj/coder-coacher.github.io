given we know the initial X velocity is
just this philosophy 50 meters per
second the X acceleration is zero as it
almost always is the Y acceleration is
10 Delta Y is this height 100 meters and
the initial y velocity is zero because
this is being shot exactly horizontally
no component of this velocity is
vertical we can plug these variables
into this equation to get a value for T
and when we do with this algebra we get
a time of four point four seven seconds
and remember both of these times are
identical I can use these three values
to find the final y velocity and it
gives me a value of 44.7 meters per
second and what about the X well if I
know the initial X velocity is 50 meters
per second I know that velocity never
changes the acceleration is zero in the
X direction this means the final x
velocity is 50 meters per second to
calculate the distance it travels in the
X direction that's this distance here I
can use this equation of course this
term goes to 0 since the X acceleration
is zero when I solve this I find Delta X
is equal to two hundred and twenty four
meters well if you got this on your
first try I am very impressed and if you
didn't hey go back and try it again if
you're still confused after a few tries
well go to the forums I'll be there so
what Jonathan this is an instructor and
all of your classmates and we're all
happy to help</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
