size doesn't matter its transparency
that's causing the problem the second
answer works the blue object is farther
from the eye than the red one so we'll
be drawn first however for more
complicated scenes it's a bit of
overkill and inefficient to boot the
sorting order of a set of opaque objects
doesn't affect the final result on the
screen that's the Z buffers job to sort
out drawing opaque objects into back to
front order is not efficient as
fragments will be processed by the
fragment shader then covered up by the
next closest object the third answer is
not particularly meaningful and won't
solve anything the blue object
essentially already has an alpha it's
equal to 1 meaningfully opaque even with
blending on an opaque object will still
act like an opaque object this solution
does not fix the problem that the blue
object is not being rendered early
enough the fourth answer works for this
case where there's only one transparent
object first all the opaque objects are
drawn there's only one it is then
guaranteed that the transparent object
will be able to blend with these opaque
objects as needed</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
