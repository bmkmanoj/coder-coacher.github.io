height they can also change elevation we
saw a glimpse of this with the magnetic
reaction of buttons to the touch of your
finger but this can also occur with
interactions such as scrolling consider
two surfaces which start off in the same
plane and move together in lockstep at a
certain point one surface may need to
stick and raise up to allow the other to
pass below it we call this a seam
two-step transition the two adjacent
surfaces first form a scene when the
lower surface slides below the other
they form a step for example this app
employs an extended app bar that
collapses to a standard height in pins
to the top of the screen as the user
Scrolls so you see the elevation
increasing now you can build this effect
entirely in XML using the new app bar
layout and collapsing toolbar layout
let's look at some layout XML code at
the root we start with coordinator
layout which helps coordinate behaviors
across several kinds of views in this
case it will coordinate the scrolling of
a list with the scrolling of our app bar
since coordinator layout is in the
Android design support library we'll
need to reference it by its full class
name and also include the app namespace
for support library attributes we'll use
an app bar layout under the coordinator
layout and give it the expanded height
we want of 168 dips within that will
include a collapsing toolbar layout and
tell it to scroll off the screen until
it reaches the collapse size that's this
exit until collapsed flag inside that
will place our tool bar widget and give
it the smaller height we want to
collapse to the 56 dips note that the
collapsing toolbar layout will be
responsible for drawing the title the
toolbar widget here is only responsible
for drawing the icons finally the other
widget here will be a recycler view
which uses a special predefined layout
behavior that triggers app bar scrolling
when the recycler view is scrolled the
Android design support library does all
the rest check out the documentation for
scroll flags and layout behaviors to
find out about
great scrolling behaviors you can build
with the library using these techniques
we can divide our UIs into surfaces to
communicate their relationship and
provide interaction cues interfaces
should be dynamic responding to user
interaction and clearly communicating
any changes in state remember these
techniques when trying to express the
relationship between your UI elements
they'll help make your screens
immediately comprehensible and make your
app much more intuitive let's go to
James who will show you how to put this
to practice with code</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
