reinforce this idea and also to let us
think about it in a slightly different
direction I want you to consider solving
the following quiz here's four payoffs
that I've put little boxes around this
one at minus one minus one this one at
minus 3 0 and this one at minus 4 minus
4 and the question is which of these
payoffs can be the average payoff for
some joint strategy and this is in the
repeated game setting ok so what we're
imagining is these two players can
coordinate in any way they want we're
not talking about trying to maximize
reward or or being Nash or anything like
that
they're just going to execute some some
pattern of strategies over infinite run
we're gonna average the payoffs that the
two players get and we'll say you know
is it possible for them to adopt a
strategy so that the average per time
step gets minus three for smooth and
zero for curly yes or no so check that
box if that's possible can it be that
they both get -1 on average if so check
this box and can it be that they both
get minus 4 on average check this box
does that does that make sense
it doesn't make sense all right so I'll
give you a chance to think it through
and answer it ok</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
