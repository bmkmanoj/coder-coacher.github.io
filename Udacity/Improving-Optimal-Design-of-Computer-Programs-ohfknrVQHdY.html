optimal strategy function now may seem
like that's impossible how could we be
better than optimal and in fact we can't
in the sense that we can't come up with
a function that produces better results
but we can come up with a function
that's faster now one thing that
bothered me about the optimal function
is a big part of it was defining this
probability of winning from a given
state and if we give it some random
state like say 07 13 19 it turns out
that the value of this state whatever
that is is exactly equal to the state
where the other players turn is to play
so here player 0 goes first here player
1 goes first but the probability of
winning for an optimal function is
symmetric because we're assuming that
the opponent is also playing optimally
so if 0 goes first against an optimal
opponent where one goes first against
the optimal opponent that probability of
winning is going to be exactly the same
but the way we defined p win it computes
both of these and stores both of these
that's wasteful so in this exercise
we're going to get rid of that waste how
wasteful is it well I'm going to do a
time call for the P wind function and
I'm going to pass it a state and pass it
the starting state and so the first time
you pass it the starting state it has to
do the complete computation to get all
the way to the end so that's going to be
a lot of work and it turns out that it
takes about three quarters of a second
to do that work when the goal is 40 and
the probability that's returned is
fifty-four percent so there's a slight
advantage over fifty percent for going
first that tells us about the time how
about the space well I can look at the
cash that the memo function has computed
its doored it at P wind cash i can
compute that length and it works out to
eighty-six thousand entries so i should
be able to cut this time down and i
should be able to cut this size of the
cache roughly in half by working more
efficiently and having a better version
of p win and we're going to do that by
defining a function p win too which is
going to have the same signature as p
win performs the same function only it's
going to do it a little bit better and
the way it works is it breaks out this
state throws away the player to play
as we know it symmetric we don't need
that and then it calls p win 3 which we
named because it takes three arguments
the only ones that matter my score your
score and the pending score and that's
what I want you to do go ahead and write
the code for P win three that will
efficiently do this computation now make
sure here that you don't get stuck in an
infinite loop take care when the value
of pending is zero that's a special case
to deal with and remember that the
probability that i win from a position
is always 1 minus the probability that
my opponent wins you may need that in
your definition</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
