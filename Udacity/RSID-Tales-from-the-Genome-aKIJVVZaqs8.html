actual allelic composition I see learn
more about sort of lactase persistence
and it says marker RS and has some some
number here that's right now if I click
on that number it takes me it tells me
that it's a snip which we all know is in
our course in snv and it gives me this
number what what is this number so
that's the snv ID is also called an RS
ID and it's a a way for everyone to have
a shared understanding of how to name a
particular snv there each of each snv is
given a name that starts with RS and
then has a long string of numbers so
while you click on that and what we find
if we click on the the RS ID is we find
that it's on chromosome 2 and it's in or
near a gene called MCM 6 and that the
versions with two alleles that one can
have our a and G which we've discussed
previously and here we again see that
Matt's genotype for this snv is a a and
I think there's no you don't get
anything more if you click further so
can there be snv's ah that have more
than two possible options at that
position here I see that most of the
snv's we look at have sort of two
letters to possible of rules are there
snv's where there are more there are
cases where there are three different
versions or leal's but most of them just
have to our by allelic if I wanted to
find out more information about this
particular smv with this sort of RS ID
right here where could i go there are a
couple databases that have more
information and one is called DB snip
and DB snip is really a list of all
known snips or snv's and and it's a
place where people share information
about snv's the other resource if you
want to learn more about a particular
snv is to go to snip area so snippy dia
is a wiki where lots of scientists put
information regarding particular SN vs
you know what is known about how they
shape human variation this means that I
could actually type in the appeal for
lactase presence here that we just
learned about and it pulls up this page
and it gives me tons of information
about it here sort of in a Wikipedia
format right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
