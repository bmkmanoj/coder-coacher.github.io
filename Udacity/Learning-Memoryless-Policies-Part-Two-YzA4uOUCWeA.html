in the case of gamma equals 1 and
probability of left as a half and
probability of right as a half turns out
it would be nice to solve for the value
function so it's a three variables that
represent the value function one from
each of those states from the Z state
what happens well with probably a half
we go to the right which ends up giving
us a immediate reward of 0 and then we
get a discounted value of being back in
Z or with the half probability we go to
the left and we get our reward of 1 and
we're done so these two thirds yeah just
boring old algebra oh I see you
magically put one half and where gamma
used to be because cam is what half that
makes sense okay fair enough I thought
that would make things easier all right
so so Z is two-thirds and let's work out
x and y okay so I guess you will do a
similar thing yeah so the value at X
from X with probably a half we go to the
left which gets us a zero reward and
then a discounted value of being back in
X or with probably a half we get no
reward and then we have a discounted
value of being in why meanwhile why the
value from why is well with probably a
half we get the discounted value of
being an X and with probability a half
we get a value of one and we're done
that's two equations into a nose yes
linear equations through them better so
convenient cool and some normal algebra
ish kind of things later I have X is 2
11th and y is 6 11 s better to be and
why so when we average our expected
Brewer discounted expected reward from
each of these possible starting States
we get a third of this and a third of
that a third that or point 4646 as our
you know value for taking this
stochastic policy that's not even 50 50
ha ok and we said that we could do
better so let's we said we could do
better by choosing probability of left
to be a third and probability of right
being two-thirds right yeah alright so
let's see if that actually gives us a
better number ok so we need to work out
what the value of Z is in this case
where we're going two-thirds one-third
so once we solve through for Z we find
out that Z as a half before he was
two-thirds and so we actually are doing
worse in this state because we're
spending more of our time bashing
against the
to the right grad school and we're going
to write down what happens from these
other two states so the value at X which
simplifies to 5x equals 2y and the value
of y again we're going to go to the left
one third of the time getting us the
value at X and we're going to go to the
right two-thirds of the time getting us
our value of one alright so once we
solve all the all that through we get y
is 5 7 and X is 2 7th and so when we
average these three values out we
actually get a half which is a little
surprising to me that the sevens kind of
cancel out but a half is bigger than
point 46 46 46 so we actually have a
better policy right and coincidentally
it does give us 50 50 what do you mean
it gives us 50 50 well you said you want
to do better than 50 50.5 that's 5050 no
no no the 50-50 policy which gets us
point 46 46 46 we did better than that
policy by trying a different policy that
actually gets point 5 I know Michael I
was using wordplay ah brilliant thank
you so I suppose using all of that
algebra we could actually figure out
what the optimal numbers are if they
aren't one-third two-thirds maybe they
are just by replacing all the one thirds
and the two thirds with p + 1 minus P
and we'd figure out what P is yeah and
I'm sure that would be a wonderful
exercise for the students do all right
so we'll leave it for that excellent</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
