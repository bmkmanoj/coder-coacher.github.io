rest of the world while respecting the
user's attention android wear feels
personal and global it's simple and
smart and it's unobtrusive and ever
ready now applications that represent
the following principles will feel most
at home in the overall Android wear
experience wearable apps are aware of
the user's context their time location
and physical activity now the apps use
this information to insert cards into
the stream when they become relevant
this makes Android wear timely relevant
and very specific a classic wristwatch
is designed to let you see the time in a
split second and get on with what you
were doing and it should be the same for
Android wear the less time it takes to
use your software the more time the user
can be present in whatever they're doing
and the more overall value they get
Android wear is fast sharp and immediate
remember what we looked at just a moment
ago the wearable can talk to the user
and the user can ask things of the
wearable now you can visualize this much
like a personal assistant it knows you
and your preferences it only interrupts
you when absolutely necessary and it's
always on hand to provide a ready answer
Android wear is helpful it's respectful
and it's responsive Android wear focuses
on simple interactions only requiring
input by the user when absolutely
necessary most inputs are based around
touch swipes and voice and inputs
requiring fine grained finger movements
are to be avoided Android wear is
gestural simple and fast now keep these
in mind as you dream up your Android
wear experience as with everything here
