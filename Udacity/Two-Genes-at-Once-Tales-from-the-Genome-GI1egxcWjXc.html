just did so let's try to make things a
little more complicated now the nice
thing in genetics is if we want to make
things complicated at all we have to do
is add one more gene and boom we've
increased our complication factor
exponentially here so we'll still do it
kind of slow we're just going to try to
do two genes at once now instead of one
let's try to look at the trait of
lactose intolerance and dwarfism at the
same time now the lactase gene is on
chromosome 2 and the fgfr3 gene which
controls the trade of achondroplasia
which causes dwarfism is on chromosome 4
and let's say we have an individual
who's heterozygous for both conditions
they're heterozygous for lactase
persistence so they are lactose tolerant
and they're also heterozygous for the
dominant allele that causes dwarfism
which means that they're also going to
be a little person now to help us know
which plus and minus symbol goes with
which trade I'm going to put an El next
to the alleles for lactose intolerance
and addie next to the alleles for
dwarfism now instead of trying to figure
out all the probabilities of what the
next generation would be let's just
focus in on how this one person who's
heterozygous for both of these trades is
actually going to make their gametes and
what are the possible allelic
combinations for them to make their
gametes so after meiosis how many
different allelic combinations or
genotypes can there possibly be for this
individual they're heterozygous for the
lactase gene and they're heterozygous
for the gene causing dwarfism</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
