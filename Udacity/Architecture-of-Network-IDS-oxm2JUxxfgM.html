rate fallacy in mind let's discuss this
is the market a chair of network ideas
first typically the volume of packet
data in a network can be huge which
means the base rate at the packet level
is typically low for example that can be
tens of millions of packets per day in a
network the only a field involved the
intrusion activities therefore according
to the base rate fallacy if we apply
detection algorithms at the packet level
this may result in very low based
indication rate instead which applied
detection models to data that has higher
base rate this can be accomplished using
a hierarchical architecture first we can
apply filters to the packet data for
example by inserting lippy capped to
capture only packets to certain services
second the event engine analyzes the
filter packet data and summarizes them
into security related events such as
failed logins finally detection models
are applied to the security related
event data as we can see the volume of
data is decreased first by the packet
filter and then the event engine
therefore as long as we can keep the
intrusion evidence in the event data the
base rate is going to be a lot higher
than the origin of packet data as a
result the ideas model apply to the
event data will you a higher base
vindication rate</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
