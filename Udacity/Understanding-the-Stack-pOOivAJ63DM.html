execute an address face it's a linear
address spaces goes from 0 to some
maximum address depending on what your
address space size is and a little bit
more complicated we'll get to that when
we talk about operating systems part of
the address spaces where the operating
system goes but the other part is where
user code and data is going to go so
that's the part we are talking about
there's some place where the code is
going to go that's code segment the long
live data goes into part of the address
space that's called the heap and the
temporary or dynamically allocated data
that we were just talking about when you
make function calls goes into the stack
that's where what the stack is used for
so we know a stack is basically the two
things you can do with the stack is push
things on it so there's a stack pointer
when you push something that is put on
top of the stack and the stack pointer
moves one place the other thing that you
can do with the stack is pop something
off it so when you do a pop operation
then the data item or the element that
is at the top of the stack the stack
pointer is pointing to actually gets
popped off put in some other place a
register or a memory location different
from the stack and then the stack
pointer is adjusted to reflect the fact
that item is no longer there so if you
sort of think about this tack as you do
push and pop the stack pointer moves and
you need to sort of see in what
direction the stack grows okay so when
you push things onto the stack the stack
is growing we are adding more items to
it when you pop things off the stack is
shrinking and the stack pointer moves as
the stack grows or shrinks so we're
going to assume that the stack actually
grows from high addresses to low
addresses so the stack pointer starts at
some address and remember the address
space starts at 0 and goes to the
maximum so in we have is increasing
addresses address n n plus 1 n plus 2
typically the byte addressable so each
unit or for which we have an address is
a byte or 8 bits so these addresses
increase as we go down that
space so when I say the stack is going
from hi addresses to low addresses what
does that mean well the stack pointer
actually absolute address value it's
going to decrease as we push things onto
the stack we allocated some amount a
room for the stack or some amount of
space where the stack can grow and
shrink and the stack pointer is
initialized to the bottom of that space
to the highest address that we have for
the stack reason and as we push things
on to the stack the stack moves to a
lower address</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
