of the business model canvas we've
talked about value props customer
segments and channels and customer
relationships and revenue streams and
partners and resources and activities
and now we get to cost structure it's
kind of ironic we're getting to the last
part of the business model canvas that
could actually put us out of business
because remember costs need to be less
so then the revenue stream at least if
not on day one over time or else you
haven't built a profitable and
sustainable business so let's take a
look at costs if you really think about
it there are two general types of costs
one called
fixed costs that is how much did my
building cost how much are my employee
cost gonna show up every month month to
month that don't move the other things
are one of my most important costs are
their resources from the resources part
of the business model canvas are their
activities that they're most expensive
did I have to do something with my
suppliers and so I really want to
understand what's the cost structure to
operate the business what are my fixed
costs one of my variable cost one of the
most expensive resources what are my
most expensive activities and I want to
add them all up and make sure that the
interaction between cost and revenue has
cost less than my revenue and again on
day one you could say no no if we're not
going to make money for the next year
two or three and as long as your
investors agree and you eventually make
money and can prove to yourself in them
you can make money it's okay to have
costs being a little more expensive but
you and your investors need to be in
sync about costs versus revenue from day
one this is something you don't want to
surprise investors about</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
