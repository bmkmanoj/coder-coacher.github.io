your own code and running it on your
computer using IntelliJ you're ready to
start on the final project for this
class the project would be the complete
code that we've started for a tic tac
toe game software developers work
together on code all the time so this
would be a good practice for working on
other people's code yeah we'll go
through the code we've written in a bit
but first let's see how to play the game
tic-tac-toe game starts with a grid like
this three by three and players take
turn putting an X or an O in one of the
empty spots I'll be X's lbos and then we
take turns and to win we're trying to
get three in a row and we can do that
diagonally horizontally or vertically
since I max is I'm going to go first and
I win because I got three in a row like
that oh man I can't believe I didn't
like that move and right now it's easy
for us to tell the answers one but this
is the part of our tic-tac-toe program
that's incomplete our current code can't
detect wins like we can so we need your
help to write code that check swing
conditions you'll use your knowledge
that you've learned in the lessons to
test conditions and look for three X's
or OS in a row next you'll see this
tic-tac-toe program in more detail and
you'll see how to download the code
we've prepared and bring it into
IntelliJ so that you can complete it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
