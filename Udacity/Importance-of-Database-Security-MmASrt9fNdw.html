there must be something different about
a securing data that is stored in a
database compared to what we've been
talking about before so what we
discussed before is data stored in files
for example when we did access control
we said you have read/write permissions
on files databases we're gonna discuss
are some more different or they also
store data but it's different and the
fact that they store lots of data that
is sensitive that's what makes this
topic important so databases actually do
store massive amounts of sensitive data
this could be if you are a company could
be your customer data in fact when we
talk about some company getting hacked
and large amounts of their customer data
such as a social security number or date
of birth or address credit card numbers
when those being stolen by hackers
databases store data that we're going to
see needs to be accessed in a certain
way and the reason we're able to do that
is because data bases can store what is
called data in a structured form and the
kind of examples that I just talked
about the data that we have about
customer records or health records that
data does have structure and the
structure actually influences how it's
gonna get accessed so I may ask for
example information about all customers
who purchased some number of things in
the last two months asking this kind of
a query or formulating this kind of a
query or a question that we want to run
against the database we make use of the
structure that is there in this data to
do that so what we really do is that I
think about a database storing
structured data and then we can
basically access it through programs
called queries that we submit to it
these programs or queries are written in
a language that is designed for
accessing data stored in databases one
common one is SQL the stands for
structured query language so we're going
to talk about accessing data from
databases using SQL quite a bit this is
another thing that is
different about databases databases also
store data that is persistent like files
and of course we need integrity of the
data one way to do that is we have this
transactional nature of queries of
programs that we run on the database
transaction means either the program
runs completely does everything it's
supposed to do or whatever it did gets
undone transaction either we have the
zero or one property either it's done
completely or not done at all kind of a
thing by running a partial transaction
for example a query could leave the
database in a state where it's not
consistent and that impacts the
integrity finally database is another
thing that's kind of different about
them is that we can sort of create a
virtual database what is called a
database view this is really derived
data that's there in the database so for
example you may want to choose a subset
of the information that's stored in the
database so you can run a query against
the database and the result could be
another sort of virtual database also
call it at a base view and then users
can have access to that view</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
