you can do with the data this is a
cleaned-up data set where took these
extreme values out manually and then I
can run a scatter plot of today's weight
was as last year's weight and when I do
this I get an interesting graph it is
approximately linear but there's some
very funny outliers there's a point over
here of this salmon thought I went from
zero to 200 for the new year and there's
also points over here that indicate
massive weight loss of massive weight
gain within the span of a year now I
have no clue why people believe I
massively lost or gained weight but as a
decision looking at the data is very
informative it tells you that even the
spectrum of good guesses there are some
that are suspicious of people who likely
didn't take the question very seriously
so as a statistician your skill will be
to look at these data points more deeply
and possibly remove them based on what
you see in this get a pet over here that
goes way beyond the idea of quarrels but
in the estimation of the mean those
phenomena have a massive impact as to
what your final outcome looks like so
thank you everybody for supplying the
data that led to this programming unit</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
