terminology but hopefully you're able to
breeze right through this one now we
have three scenarios a lot of
transcription a medium amount of
transcription and no transcription if we
need to match the scenario on the right
with the scenario on the left so which
scenario on the left would give us let's
say the least amount of transcription
well obviously if our silencer is bound
that silence is transcription enhancer
enhances transcription so if we've
silenced our transcription and we don't
have anything to help enhance this is
probably the scenario in which we're
gonna have no little to no transcription
at all the scenario above it however we
have the enhancer bound and the
silencers unbound remember the proteins
mitigate the effects of what these
non-coding regions can do so a bound
enhancer is going to enhance
transcription an unbound silencer won't
be able to silence transcription and so
this is going to be our most active
transcription here lots of transcription
so the answer to this one is a and that
leaves this last scenario well we don't
have a bound enhancer we don't have a
bound silencer the promoter is left to
initiate whatever transcription it can
on its own and so we reach the scenario
of some transcription it depends
entirely on the promoter region itself
but in general there's going to be some
transcription that happens at the site
but because there's no enhancer or
silenced or bound we're not going to
have these extreme show up where we have
a lot of transcription happening or no
transcription happening</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
