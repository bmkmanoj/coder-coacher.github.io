don't expect you to absorb it all at
once but I do want to do at least heard
the idea I know it's taken me about 20
years to really grasp this whole concept
let's get started in previous lessons
we've seen that the order of transforms
for an object is usually rotate and then
translate for example we start with the
letter F at the origin if we rotate it
negative 45 degrees we get a tilted F we
then translated by one unit vertically
and it moves up this we write out as TR
with the matrices applied in reverse
order however we're now able to use
matrices whichever way we want so say we
reverse the order if instead we first
translate up a unit then rotate we get
this the notation RT clearly different
with T changing the origin we then
rotate around here's another way to look
at it say we first just rotate the F we
express this by the notation are we
could add a translation matrix before or
after this rotation if we add it before
they are this means we translate the
object after the rotation and so move it
with respect to the world whatever
happened before this translation was
applied is said and done the object is
in whatever orientation that's already
been set ancient history so TR is this
top case as before if we put the tea
after they are it says to apply the
translation first then everything is
rotated around the origin so far I
haven't said anything new however
another way to look at all this is that
you're changing the frame of reference
by each of these transforms instead of
rotating or translating the object we
can think about it as changing this
frame of reference by taking this new
path we can think of the transforms in
these terms first the rotation changes
the frame of reference that any
transforms to the right of it will use
then the translation moves the object
with respect to this new frame of
reference any point in space is given
some XYZ coordinate only with respect to
something we started off by thinking of
this something as world space but notice
that we've actually been making models
in what we call model space and then
transforming them to world space for
example when we have a parent-child
relationship the child is oriented with
respect to the parent not the world so
it's all about respect just a little bit
when
we put the T matrix after they are we're
saying to translate with respect to the
view of the world of the our matrix so
putting the T here moves objects with
respect to the are matrices frame of
reference that is the translation is
done with respect to the arse y-axis
putting the T in front of the R means
that the translation is not done in the
arse frame of reference but in the
world's frame of reference the r itself
is now influenced by the t's frame of
reference another way to say this is
that the first matrix to the right of
some given set of matrices is
transforming the object with respect to
that set in other words everything to
the left of it for example on the top
here the rotation is transforming the F
with respect to the frame of reference
of the T translation to its left this
all may sound up tues but think of
someone looking at a hubcap in your
model he wants to know where it's
located in what angle it's at you might
describe it as well I move the hubcap so
be properly attached to the wheel and
then I move the wheel so that but he
cuts you off I don't care how it got
there where is it now when you position
the hubcap you weren't really moving the
hubcap to its position you are
positioning it with respect to the
wheels frame of reference and then you
were positioning the wheel with respect
to the cars frame of reference it's more
like the car's location in the wheels
location were maps for where the hubcap
should go different frames of reference
are just like you might use latitude and
longitude to fly somewhere then use a
street map a different frame of
reference to get to the airport to the
office then use a map of the building to
find the room you want each frame of
reference takes you to the next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
