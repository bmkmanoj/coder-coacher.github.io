you think about the future of data
visualization what are you most excited
about can you start with what I'm not
excited about yeah not excited about
more tools more data that's like usually
I think what people are excited about
this like every week some new tool gets
announced and every week you know some
government releases in some new data set
and like it's all very good but it can
just be so overwhelming I think
especially for people who are new so I
have to say I'm 11 and I'm excited about
that I'm on the other hand I'm like not
very excited about that I guess what I
am excited about is having better
resources for new people and having like
all so much excitement like just just
getting these new people into the field
because kind of like I was saying
earlier like everybody brings their own
experience and it's been you know I
think visualization actually has this
really long history but it's sort of
because it's kind of blowing up in this
whole new way just recently like this
convergence of open data and tools and
open source and all those four things
you need to practice it getting more and
more accessible plus of course kind of
the buzzwords of big data and like all
this stuff we're excited about so all
these things have converged to make this
like a really hot exciting field right
now which is great but I think we forget
that there's this whole history you know
of this feel then that this this history
is related to kind of representations of
information before we started calling it
data biz and it goes back to to design
and like how we evolved written language
and you know hieroglyphics and all this
all this stuff so I think kind of in the
early days in this new resurgence of
data visualization
practice was limited to kind of some
academics and then a handful of really
specialized design firms but now it's
it's much much bigger than that so we
have lots of people have people internal
at companies who just do data viz for
that company we have more and more of
these kind of boutique design firms that
do kind of data design data
visualization we have existing firms
like design firms graphic design who are
getting into doing data and so and then
of course we have like students and
academics and just kind of people who
don't fit into any of those categories
who are practicing so I think that's
really really exciting but it's also i
guess a challenge for us because we have
the existing books and resources and
things are great but not totally
adequate because they they address kind
of different audiences in in that vein
edward tufte use books are fantastic but
like he's a statistician and they're
coming from this one point of view and I
still recommend the books to everyone
but they don't address all the latest
kind of developments in interactive
design and what does this mean
translating these ideas to a mobile
experience what does this mean trans
leaving this idea to a dashboard or a
billboard or you know something in an
advertisement so they're all kinds of
these new considerations and I guess I'm
excited about us together gradually
figuring out ways to address all those
considerations what are you most excited
about when you think about the future of
data visualization I think what we're
most excited about at plot Lee and we
think a lot about is what it would be
like to be able to have massive
worldwide collaboration in doing data
analysis and graphing and so a big part
of what we've thought about for plot lee
is making everything web ready so if you
already know let's say MATLAB or you're
really good at using Excel we don't
think that it makes a lot of sense for
you to also have to learn how to do web
development so we've tried to make it so
it's really easy to keep using the tools
that you're using
but then being able to get a web and
collaboration layer for sharing your
work with people from any language who
are using any different type of
technology any different data type and
so it can really kind of be a
translation layer because if you have
really sophisticated let's say political
scientists and engineers and data
scientists who are all able to
collaborate between their respective
preferred development languages and
tools and able to discuss things and
make reproducible graphs and data and
work on massive research projects we
really hope that it would be able to
further you know science and
collaboration and really any field of
you know so we've thought about what if
folks from NASA we're streaming flight
data and showing live satellite data
what if groups that we're doing research
on cancer we're able to share the
results with the world so anyone can
reproduce their work and get involved
with what they're doing so experts can
collaborate naturally even if they
didn't necessarily plan to do so from
the beginning because if you make data
and if you make graphs and you make
tools available and free and easy to use
we think there's a lot of power behind
that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
