gene sequence here from the coding
region we're gonna take all the sequence
from position 793 to position 801 so
we're in the ABO gene their sequence on
either side of this but I want to focus
in on this little snippet here
the TAC CT gggg now let's imagine that
this is part of a DNA coding region in
the ABO gene and that it's going to be
turned into protein and the codons would
be read like this where we're in frame
we're reading along and we had a codon
a codon and a codon I want you to
imagine that you arrive assume and you
were going to translate this sequence so
what would be the amino acids produced
from this DNA sequence from the coding
region of the ABO gene I want you to use
your genetic code and look for the one
letter abbreviations of the amino acids
and put what answer you think it would
be in this text box here remember this
is something you're going to need to use
your genetic code for which you can see
in a miniaturized version here but you
can also get it in a link located in the
instructors notes on this page it's
probably a good idea to go ahead and
print this off and keep it handy
somewhere as we're going to keep coming
back to it throughout other exercises in
this lesson and other lessons</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
