and I work here at Udacity I was a
classroom teacher for 10 years and now
since leaving the classroom and working
for ed tech companies for about the past
five years and been working side by side
with programmers and what you might call
tech adjacent roles and I still have had
that kind of underlying lack of
confidence and I feel a little
intimidated to ask questions because I'm
not sure if I'm asking the right
questions and so I just really felt that
it's maybe I'm being inefficient by not
understanding more about the world of
programming so I really wanted to jump
in and try to learn really to just be
better at what I do and also I'm a
business owner and I own a couple of
running stores and we have a website
I've been able to just jump in there and
use some of my new HTML and CSS skills
to to work on it and make it more
appealing the more you can find out
about the different career options there
are the better we don't work in a world
where you have to pick one path and
stick in it for the rest of your life in
fact a lot of things have blurred lines
but you can also work in places where
you may be one thing on paper but you're
getting your hands into a lot of other
areas too</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
