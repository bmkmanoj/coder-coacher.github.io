allele has an effect the t allele even
when there's only one copy so if you're
homozygous thymine or heterozygous
thymine cytosine as long as you have one
of these thymine alleles or the the plus
alleles we're going to be lactase
persistent and therefore we're going to
be lactose tolerant only the homozygous
combination of sight essenes the minus
minus combination are we going to end up
with lactase non persistence and a
phenotype of lactose intolerance so out
of the three possible allelic
combinations two of them result in
lactose tolerance and one of them
results in lactose intolerance thus
lactose intolerant is considered a
recessive trait and by recessive we just
mean it's masked by the presence of
another allele where's the other trait
tolerance lactose tolerance or the t
allele is considered dominant because we
only need one copy to see in effect
these two words are used so often in
genetics and the way we use them is only
in a relative fashion comparing one
allele to another the cytosine allele is
recessive compared to the dominant
thymine allele or T is dominant to see
here an allele cannot be dominant or
recessive in isolation we can only
define it in this fashion when we're
comparing it to another allele with this
information we're actually ready to look
at how lactose intolerance can be
inherited let's look back at Kate's
pedigree of lactose intolerance and
focused specifically on Kate and her
brother using information about
dominance and recessive pneus you should
be able to determine what the possible
allelic combinations or genotypes could
be for Kate and her brother here in each
column I want you to select any and all
boxes that you think could possibly
apply remember look at the pedigree
taking all the information you can
synthesize it with what you know about
traits and alleles that are dominant
versus recessive and remember that a
shaded individual means they're affected
by lactose intolerance and if they're
not shaded they're not affected by
lactose
it's their lactose tolerant</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
