you what we think the answers are now
the nice thing about a decision tree
sort of conceptually and intuitively is
that it really is asking a series of
questions so we can simply look at these
rows over here and the values that our
features have and we can just follow
down the path of the tree so in the
first case we have true we have true for
occupied which means we want to go down
the right side of the tree and check on
the type so in the first case the type
is pizza and so we go down the first
branch and that means we do not go down
the tree so the output is no-go so okay
so now I got a different answer so I
looked at this and I said happiness is
true and the bottom box says happiness
true you go right so you got the wrong
you got what I'm going to tell you is
the wrong answer by going at from the
bottom of the tree up the way decision
trees work is you always start at the
root of the tree that is the very top of
the tree and you ask the questions in
those in that order it just seems like
it would be faster to start at the
bottom yeah but then you would never
look at anything else and a good point
all right so if you start at the bottom
you can't go up all right so okay so let
me see if I get this straight so I'll do
this the second instance the second
instance you say that we need to start
at the top of the tree where it says
occupied and so now I look at the
instance and the instance says that it's
false for occupied so we go down that
left branch and we hit no go oh wait but
now I haven't looked at any of the other
nodes oh and you don't have to look at
any of the other nodes because it turns
out that if it's not occupied you just
don't go into a restaurant so you're the
type of person who doesn't like to be
the only person in a restaurant got it
all right so that's a no-go so that's a
no-go that's an important point Michael
actually you might also notice that this
whole tree even if you look at every
single feature in the tree only has
three of the attributes it only looks at
occupied type
and Happiness I see so hot date is sort
of irrelevant which is good because in
this case it's not really changing from
instance to instance anyway true and
neither is hungry you might notice oh I
am kind of hungry
although I'm always hungry although
rainy does in fact change a little bit
here and there but apparently it doesn't
matter I see because you always take an
umbrella got it
okay so let's quickly do the other three
and see if we we come to the same
conclusion
all right well all the instances that
have occupied false we know those are
no-go
right away no a good point can do it
kind of out of order and the other ones
are both occupied one is Thai and one is
other for the Thai one we go if the
other one oh I see for the other one we
have to look at whether there's
happiness or not and in this instance
happiness is true so we go down the
right branch and we go and we go exactly
it so we notice that hot date doesn't
matter hungry doesn't matter and rainy
doesn't matter the only thing that
matters or whether you're occupied what
type of restaurant you're at and whether
you're happy or not or whether the the
patrons and the restaurants or
restaurants are happy or not but here's
the other thing about this it's not just
about the features let's tie it back
into the other things that we mentioned
in the beginning this in our case this
table actually represents our testing
set it's the thing that we're going to
look at to determine whether we were
right or wrong these are the examples
that we're going to do to see whether we
generalize or not and this particular
tree here is our candidate concept so
there are lots and lots and lots of
other trees that we might have used we
might have used a tree that also took
asked questions about whether it was
rainy or not or ask questions about
whether you're on a hot date or not but
we didn't we pick a specific tree that
had only these three features and only
asked in this particular way so what
we're going to talk about next is how we
might decide whether to choose this tree
over any of the other possible number of
trees that we might have chosen instead</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
