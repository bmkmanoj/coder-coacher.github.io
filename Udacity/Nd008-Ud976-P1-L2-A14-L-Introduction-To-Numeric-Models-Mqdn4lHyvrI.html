into numeric models by introducing
target variables since the underlying
math uses variables and equations and
we're effectively solving an equation
for a variable that represents the
outcome will be using target variable to
represent the outcome or solving for all
right so now that we know how to
determine if the target variable is
numeric or non-numeric we need to
investigate the target variable a little
further this will help us identify the
most appropriate model but first let's
focus on numeric variables at this point
we need to determine what type of
numeric variable the target is there are
three types of numeric variables
continuous time-based and count the
first type of variable will discuss is
continuous a continuous variable is one
that can take on all values in a range
for instance your height can be measured
down to many decimal places we don't
grow and even inch intervals the second
type of numeric variable is a time-based
variable the time-based numeric variable
is one where you're trying to predict
what will happen over time this is often
related to forecasting the third type of
numeric variable is a count variable
count variables are numbers that are
discrete positive integers they're
called count numbers because they're
used to analyze variables that you can
count as modeling these types of
variables is not common in business we
won't be covering this topic in this
course now that we know the types of
numeric variables we can find the types
of models that are appropriate for the
target variable if the target variable
is a continuous variable we can build
continuous models to solve the business
problem if the target variable is time
based we can do time series analysis to
solve the business problem the important
takeaway from this lesson is the ability
to determine if you should use a numeric
model and whether it should be a
continuous or time based model I do want
to take a moment to highlight the fact
that there are many more models
available to use but the focus of this
course is on some of the more commonly
used models in subsequent courses
we'll go into much more detail about the
specific models</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
