certain properties is expected to
require an amount of work and by
adjusting those properties we can
increase the amount of work so this is
what Bitcoin does so in order to create
a new block which would validate the
next history of transactions it's
necessary to find some value X such as
the hash of the hash of the state
concatenated with X is less than some
target you keep increasing the value of
X until you find one that satisfies that
property and that provides the time step
that allows a new block to be generated
so this is the idea Bitcoin uses to
generate a time stamp is you have to
keep finding new blocks and a block will
validate a set of transactions but to
generate a new block you've got to find
a new time stamp which is this target so
you've got to find a value where the
hash of the hash of the state
concatenated with that value and the
state does two important things it
includes information about the previous
block so this is how the time stamps
form a chain that the state must include
the previous block that also includes
some information that's likely to be
unique for each member of the network
this is how they avoid it being the case
that they're all racing to find the same
value X so given those properties then
the goal is to find the value X that you
can concatenate with that to be less
than some target and the value of the
target controls how hard is it to find
and the way the Bitcoin currency is
designed to work is this value of the
target is adjusted in a way that makes
the time to find X keep about ten
minutes that's the time for the whole
network to find the next value so that
value of the target will keep decreasing
as the computing power in the network
increases and if you go to the Bitcoin
website you can see the current value of
the target which is this value that in
order to create a new block you've got
to find an x value such that this
property is less than the target and I
should emphasize that these zeros are
not just one bit this is hex so each one
of these zeros is four bits
so you've got to find a value where the
hash starts with 54 zeroes followed by
something less than 1 0 &amp;amp; 1 &amp;amp; more so if
you found a value that hashed where the
results started with 55 zeroes are
started with 54 0 is a 1 0 and a 0 well
then you'd be golden you'd be able to
create the next block that would allow
you to earn the value of a new block
which currently is 50 bitcoins each
bitcoin is worth about five dollars so
finding a hash that hashes to this would
be worth about $250 and the rest of the
network can verify that it can compute
the same hash function verify that for
the x value that you found the value is
less than target and that will add that
block to the Bitcoin network so the
difficulty of finding such hashes keeps
decreasing the reason it's still low is
because of using GPUs if you're using a
regular processor it would use far more
than $250 in computing power to find
such a hash value if you have a GPU
there algorithms for implementing the
hash function more efficiently that
would mean that finding a value that
satisfies this property should require
about that much value in computing power
so to see if this makes sense I want to
ask why the timestamp function the one
here to find the next block uses two
hashes instead of one here are the
choices see if you can figure out which
one would make the most sense as to why
there are two hash functions here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
