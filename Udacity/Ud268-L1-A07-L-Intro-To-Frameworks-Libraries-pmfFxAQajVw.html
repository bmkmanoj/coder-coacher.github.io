the server and our goal here is to write
Ruby code that lives on the server
handles incoming requests and responds
with appropriate content back to the
client so that's the role of Ruby in web
development so where does Sinatra fit
into this equation Sinatra is a ruby gem
that helps us build web applications
faster than we could otherwise Sinatra
is what is known as a framework it's a
tool that makes our lives easier and it
makes web development with Ruby simpler
and faster so you could write an entire
web application without any tools or
frameworks like Sinatra to help you out
but it would take much much longer to do
so we would have to write all of our own
basic web development infrastructure
code that includes things like listening
to ports parsing HTTP request headers
providing middleware hooks constructing
responses compiling templates handling
errors scheduling and concurrency and
managing development environments along
with a whole bunch of other stuff you
would need to worry about it's pretty
crazy stuff and not only is this a ton
of code it's all pretty complex stuff to
write and I'd wager that most web
developers out there wouldn't know where
to start fortunately we have frameworks
like Sinatra out there that help us so
we don't have to worry about most of
this stuff to get going a common
misconception is that frameworks will
actually write applications for you that
frameworks somehow do all of the work or
that they're like mean-spirited robots
like this one that write your code for
you and gain total control over
everything including your application
and your free will but that couldn't be
further from the truth frameworks are
more like friendly robots that just want
to help you out like this one here there
are tools that abstract away the code
that is common to all web applications
all the groundwork so that you can focus
on writing the code that makes your
application unique and you don't have to
worry about all the other stuff thanks
from the robot but how do frameworks do
this well Sinatra does it by providing a
bunch of helpful methods that we can use
in our own applications
just by including Sinatra and a ruby app
with a single line we get access to all
of these built-in methods for free as
you can see here there's quite a few of
them pages and pages of these methods
that we get for free so for example here
are three very simple lines typical of
Sinatra app that use two different
Sinatra methods get and send file though
this appears pretty simple there are
hundreds and hundreds of lines of Ruby
at work behind the scenes built into the
Sinatra source code so let's take a five
second tour of the Sinatra source this
get method looks like this this get
method also calls another method called
route that looks like this route calls a
bunch of methods including route eval
and process route and process route
looks like this which calls a params
method that looks like this and then the
other method we saw was send file which
is pretty lengthy too so this should
look pretty confusing and probably scary
and that's the point that we don't have
to worry about this would you want to
write all this stuff just to get a
simple app up and running well vasu not
sure you don't Sinatra helps us so we
can just focus on writing the code that
makes your application your application
and to be clear there are tons of
different tools that web developers use
when creating apps like Django for
Python express for nodejs and most
popular evolved Ruby on Rails Ford Ruby
that exists to make web development
easier but they do each have their own
particular uses and specialties Sinatra
in particular is popular for its
simplicity and ease of use and it makes
a really good first framework before you
jump on to a more complex framework like
Ruby on Rails</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
