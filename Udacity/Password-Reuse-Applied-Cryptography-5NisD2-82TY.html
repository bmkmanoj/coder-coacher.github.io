avoid many of the problems with
passwords and one big problem with
passwords is that they were used and
there are lots of ways to reuse
passwords some of this is using the same
password across many sites and that's
not what I'm talking about here talking
about the point that every time Alice
logs in while she enters this same exact
password the password is the same until
she does something to change it
so she's typing the same password many
times this means if there's something
logging what she types it will learn her
password if she types it in an internet
cafe or somewhere where it's visible to
someone looking over her shoulder a
shoulder surfer it's also the case that
her device that she enters her password
and would start to have smudges where if
she types her password this is
particular problem for short pins on
smartphones that are entered so many
times the finger smudges start to give
an idea of what the password might be
all of these problems stem from using
the same password every time she logs in
so we're going to talk about one way to
avoid that which is to use a hash chain
and hash chains have lots of interesting
applications in this case we're gonna do
the hash chain to make it so we still
have the nice property that we had with
the password file where the server
stores no secrets it doesn't matter if
all the data on the server is
compromised that still wouldn't give
someone the ability to log in as Alice</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
