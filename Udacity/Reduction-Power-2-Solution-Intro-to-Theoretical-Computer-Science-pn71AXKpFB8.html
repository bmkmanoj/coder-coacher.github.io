and that's because well we've already
gotten rid of any vertices that have k
plus 1 edges or more so all the
remaining vertices can have at most cave
edges connected to them now to answer
this final problem we have to remember
that we said earlier that at most K
vertices are needed to cover the entire
graph well if there are K vertices
necessary to cover the graph and each
vertex has at most K edges attached to
it then the remaining graph can have no
more than K squared edges since we have
to cover all of them now this might have
seemed a little involved but there's
actually something powerful here what
this means is that after doing all of
these little pre-processing steps then
we either know that the graph G is not a
yes instance of the vertex cover
decision problem in other words it's a
no instance or we know the size of the
resulting graph is bounded not as a
function of n which it was originally
but rather as a function of K and
remember we said earlier that very often
k is far less than n so this is
potentially a very big win for us</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
