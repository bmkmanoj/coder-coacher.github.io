np-complete problems given just what we
proved in the last lesson we've shown
that we can take an arbitrary problem in
NP and reduce it to CNF satisfiability
that's what the cook Levin theorem said
we did do another polynomial reduction
one of the independent set or a clique
problem to the vertex cover problem
again I'm treating clique and
independent set here as one because the
problems are so similar much of the
lesson will be concerned with connecting
up these two links into a chain first
we're going to reduce general CNF SAT 23
CNF SAT where each Clause has exactly
three literals this is a critical
reduction because 3sat is much easier to
reduce to other problems than general
CNF set then we're going to reduce three
CNF to independent set in by
transitivity this will show that this
whole chain here is np-complete note
that this is very convenient because it
would have been pretty messy to try to
reduce every problem to NP to these
problems directly finally we will reduce
three CNF SAT to the subset sum problem
to give you a fuller sense of the types
of arguments that go into reductions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
