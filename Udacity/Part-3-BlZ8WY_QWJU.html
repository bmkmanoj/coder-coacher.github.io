so we declare the two variables and then
there's a to print lines the first one
excuse me did the recorder correct the
comment make note of the errors in the
comments that slash Astrix should be our
new standard cooking yeah agent be
pointed out that we should it said that
they were characters but they were
declared as integers for int next it
says next character incidents but 930
implication is it you're confused about
character versus integers even the
representation what's still assign ok so
as I was saying there's two print
statement the first one Prince to the
user enter a sentence ending with a
period and the second one says follow
each character by a return like yeah as
I guess by should not really be fine and
also probably follow should be
capitalized right i mean it's a separate
Senate see you turn it right it is a
second order should be all in one line
they're breaking an interest in
attending with period okay I see but it
also it's interesting interest in
attending with the period doesn't have a
delimiter at the end whereas following
each character by a return does have a
delimiter should that be a have a colon
episode we're really getting stuck on
minority tonight bungee Tlakula that's
the move on let's move on back to dr.
bug is continuous so a character is
misspelled and shorter just making I
think it's making for bad user
expression we don't we don't you know
you actually I think I would just call
based in here from someone else's could
but it's fine yeah I think Bella we do
know it's always a big mistake copy run
other people's without well just this
say no this was whose was it that we
copy from it was a fun of a log i mean i
think was actually crazy Bob's code but
tiny wrong look at my coat cause it's
not a native yeah I wasn't made the
piece of code in fact if we could just
go back and revisit 13 and 14 you know
that this initialization problem
wouldn't even be occurring because you
can't have uninitialized data in abus
old if we'd actually done what we said
what I said originally we wouldn't be
having these problems you're
so they write and forgot about that
crazy Bob breaking brings up some
excellent points about this lousy code
we're looking at I have to say actually
that I am pretty sure that in Java when
you declare a local variable like this
it gets initialized automatically 20 it
might be wrong that's the instance
variables that are initialized and the
local verbals are not initialized okay
maybe I'm wrong them even if they're
automatically initial I stood code
behavior would be that you actually
initialize them so that everybody
doesn't have to remember whether it
works or not not just you know I was
used to developing ADA so lets me out
okay let us continue dr.
