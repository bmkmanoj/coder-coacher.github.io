pretty simple first we just call normal
get on the cash and if there was a value
return that value plus hash rapper V
which will just return a nice hash to
the value for us now here's the cast
function first we call gets and if the
value is actually in the cash we have
our value in our unique and then we
compare the unique we got from a cash to
the unique that was passed in and if
they match we call set and we return the
value of set which in our case always
returns true otherwise we return false
simple enough let's go ahead and give
this a test okay first I'm going to run
the basic functions you know it should
print through one none none and then at
up all of two in our hash which in this
case is this number here and then it
should print false because we tried to
overwrite X with the value three giving
it the wrong hash in this case zero and
now that we have our hash let's go ahead
and paste that into here and see if
these next two statements run ok so I
click run again and we can see that we
are printing all the original commands
still run the hash is still the same
this cat's command here set X 23 with
kass kass unique value of zero Prince
false because unique doesn't match what
it's what the unique should be is this
value here and when we try to set X 24
we see true and when we get X we can see
that it was properly set the four so
that's how gets and cass work they're
built in the memcached you won't ever
have to implement them but now that you
know how they work you'll be able to use
them in production much better and you
have another tool in your toolbox for
dealing with complicated caching issues</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
