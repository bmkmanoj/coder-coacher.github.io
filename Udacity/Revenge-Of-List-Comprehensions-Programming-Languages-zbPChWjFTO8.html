to help us write our parser we were
introduced to them earlier and many
computer scientists love list
comprehensions because they allow you to
state what must be true about a list and
let the computer figure out how to get
there so just to remind you a bit of
list comprehensions we use the square
bracket to say I'm making the list but
instead of listing all of the elements
directly I have some sort of formula
what I really want is to take all of the
elements in one two three four five
let's call each of those X I want my new
list to be all of those squared so x
times X so one two three four or five
should give us 14 9 16 25 and down here
in the output it does in list
comprehensions we can also put little
clauses or guards to only take some of
the input list let's say that I only
want to square those numbers that are
odd well I write everything just the
same as before but at the end i put in
this little guard that says only yield
this element if x modulo 2 is one that
is if x is odd if the remainder when
dividing x by 2 is one so the second
list only contains 19 and 25 for the
number is 13 and five so we had our
little refresher on list comprehensions
and now we want to parse a string
according to a grammar so let's say our
grammar would look like this if we wrote
it down on a piece of paper we need to
encode it in Python well here's one way
to do it I'm going to take all of the
left-hand sides of all of the rules and
write them out as the first part of a
tuple and then all of the right-hand
sides like open p clothes become
elements of a list open p clothes so
here my grammar had three rules and here
my grammar is a list of three elements
the second element corresponds to my
second grammar rule p on the left-hand
side p in the 0th position open p close
on the right-hand side open p close in a
list on the first position i'm going to
need to do the same thing with parser
states here's how i might draw one in
color on a piece of paper and here's how
I'm going to encode it in Python this is
just one way to do it we could pick a
different way but this is
going to simplify our implementation
there are really four parts of our
parsing state the left hand side
non-terminal some list of terminals and
non terminals before the dot some list
after and J the right arrow the dot and
the word from we always have to write
them so I don't need to store them I'm
not going to write down from every time
we'll just remember it so I'm just going
to make my state a four tuple but
instead of it being one two three four
one will be the non terminal on the left
this will be a list of a and B and there
might be more things here or there might
be nothing at which point it's the empty
list three will be a list of things
after the dot there might be more things
there or again there might be nothing at
which point probably we want to use
reduction and then J will just be some
integer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
