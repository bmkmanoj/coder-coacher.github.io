test-driven development by going back to
a software lifecycle do we examined a
little bit ago which is the waterfall
lifecycle if you remember there was a
fairly rigid process in which we were
preparing documents and we were not
starting any phase that before the
previous one was finished and once a
phase was finished we were really going
back to it so today we're going to
examine how it is possible to go from
such a rigid process to an edger one in
which we can better deal with changes so
remember what we saw in the first lesson
when very beam stated that the cost of
change grows exponentially with time so
if we imagine to have a time over here
on the next axis and cost on a y-axis
you can see that the cost that will go
up more or less this way and what that
means is that finding a problem while
collecting requirements will cost you
much less than finding a problem in the
analysis phase which in turn will cost
you less than finding a problem during
design and so on for the subsequent
phases so if this is the case and cost
is really growing this fast as we
proceed in our process or should we do
the key thing is to discover errors
early before they become expensive which
in turn means doing a lot of upfront
planning and because models are cheaper
to modify them code we're willing to
make large investments in upfront
analysis and design models and only
after we've built and check these models
we're going to go ahead and build a code
in other words we're following a
waterfall mentality however something
definitely changed in the last 30 years
for example 30 years ago we needed to
walk down the hall submit a deck of
cards to an operator and wait a day for
our program to run and produce some
results today we can leverage a
computational power of the cloud
computers used to be very slow and very
expensive today computer are a thousand
times faster and a thousand times
cheaper than what they used to be in
particular if you think about the
compile and test cycle that has gone
from days two seconds now we can change
our code compile it run at our tests all
in a matter of instance something that
was unthinkable before finally
developers in the past had to do a lot
of tasks manually in a very
time-consuming way and often in a very
painful way today on the contrary we
cannot automate a lot of these tasks we
have high level programming languages
version control systems smart ID is
basically a whole set of tools that can
help developers and the
make them more efficient in general what
that means is it's easy to change much
easier than what it was before so maybe
if we take all that into account the
cost of change can be fly so if we go
back to our diagram the one in which we
show the cost with respect to the
project time maybe instead of having
this kind of curve we might have a
different kind of curve maybe the curve
is more like this one so maybe we can
make all of this happen as long as we
use tools practices and principles in
the right way and we're going to see
what that means</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
