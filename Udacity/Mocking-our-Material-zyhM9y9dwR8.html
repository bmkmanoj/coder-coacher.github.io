design of sunshine before we dive into
this further let me make it clear that
there are many positive things about the
sunshine design particularly the
portrait phone model the landscape
version however is very clearly a
stretched version of the portrait design
the giant blue splash the today view is
a nice idea but it's a bit too much
especially in landscape the use of
Roboto condensed detraction the appeal
of these views the detail views even on
a phone start to fall down it's a pretty
simplistic presentation with uneven use
of white space the landscape version
even needs to scroll to show all content
for the portrait forecast view we're
going to moving towards better use of
color in white space even though we're
initially using up more space with the
app bar we're going to add some code to
allow us to scroll it along with the
forecast list for the landscape view
we're doing something pretty radical in
order to improve the use of white space
namely we've eliminated most of the app
bar by taking the sides of the list in
we provide more balance this layout it's
not ideal but it's more aesthetically
pleasing will also demonstrate some
parallax scrolling here for the detail
view we're doing a more serious overhaul
we're using a toolbar that matches the
coloring of the detail view and only
contain share functionality the bottom
includes a nice accent shade with a
separate section of the app for data
unique to the detail view overall it's a
far better use of white space and a good
teaching ground for some more advanced
layout techniques the landscape detail
view is even more striking in comparison
to the original application it not only
has a nice look it actually fits more
information on the screen the landscape
tablet version wouldn't make it on
google play as a tablet-optimized
application with all that unused space
we'll give it a fresh look with the
update our portrait tablet is even more
striking in its comparative use of white
space it's a challenge to display an app
which has lists like this in portrait
tableaus without falling into confusing
user scenarios such as changing the
number of fragments on screen between
portrait and landscape well dive deeper
into implementing this design throughout
the lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
