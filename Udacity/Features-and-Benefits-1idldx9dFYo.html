database is a better choice than other
data options out there but are there
other features that are part of the
platform that are a good fit for
shopping those plus plaus well knowing
what you want to do with your
application here are the top reasons why
I think you should use firebase data
that is available in real time so users
all get updated shopping lists on demand
so if Walter add some items on a
shopping list you will see these
immediately synchronization handled by
the client regardless if the client is
online or offline this ensures that
clients that were turned off or maybe an
airplane mode get the freshest copy of
the data possible when they come back
online this is also helpful because you
can still add items to shopping lists
when you're offline and have those
changes available to Walter when you're
back online easy to implement
authentication methods all without
writing 00 auth clients with this Walter
can use his email and password or is
google plus account to log on well in
addition to what we've talked about
another benefit is firebases two-tier
approach many applications use a
three-tier approach where the middle
tier contains business logic or some
application server but this introduces
complexity and system management issues
for shopping list plus plus it's not
necessary instead with firebase you use
a two-tier approach basically this is a
client-server model where you
communicate directly with the database
it's cheaper easier to maintain quicker
to set up and in the case of firebase
highly performant alright that sounds
pretty good to me although I do have one
more request do you happen to know any
developers that are actually using
firebase sure I've actually got a
firebase developer advocate here with me
right now well shoot I'm a bit busy
getting our first user set up with the
app but the developer has some free time
maybe they could join you sure that'd be
great hey if you want you can take the
company skateboard</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
