line and instead let's declare that NRI
is a decorator and we'll write a
definition of what it means to be a
decorator in terms of updating rappers
then we'll be done we've done it once
and for all we can apply it to NRI and
we can apply it to any other decorator
that we define this is starting to get a
little bit confusing because here we're
trying to define decorator and decorator
is a decorator have we gone too far into
recursion is that going to bottom out
let's draw some pictures and try to make
sense of it so we've defined an airy and
we've declared that as being a decorator
and that's the same as saying NR e
equals decorator of an airy and then
we've used n area as a decorator we've
defined sequence to be an NRI function
and that's the same as saying sequence
equals n airy of sequence now we wanted
to make sure that there's an update so
that the documentation and the name of
sequence gets copied over we want to
take it from this function pass it over
to this function because that's the one
we're going to keep and while we're at
it we might as well do it for n area as
well we want to have the name of NRI be
an Aryan not something arbitrary that
came out of decorator so we've got two
updates that we want to do for the
function that we decorated and for the
decorator itself now let's see if we can
write decorator so that it does those
two updates so let's define decorator
takes an argument d which is a function
then we call the function we're going to
return underscore d and that takes a
function as input and so it returns the
update wrapper from applying the
decorator to the function and copying
over onto that decorated function the
contents of the original functions
documentation and name and then we also
want to update the wrapper for the
decorator itself so from d the decorated
function we want to copy that over into
underscore d and then return under
now which update is which well this one
here is the update of underscore D with
D and this one is the update of the
decorated function from the function so
here we're saying the new n area that
we're defining gets the name from the
old NRI the name in the documentation
string and here we're saying the new
sequence the new anna-marie sequence
gets its name from the old sequence and
here's what it's all looks like if you
didn't quite follow that the first time
don't worry about it that's probably the
most confusing thing in the entire class
because we've got functions pointing to
other functions pointing to other
functions so try to follow the pictures
if you can't follow the pictures that's
ok just type it into the interpreter but
these definitions in decorate some
functions decorated some an airy
functions and take a look at them and
see how it works</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
