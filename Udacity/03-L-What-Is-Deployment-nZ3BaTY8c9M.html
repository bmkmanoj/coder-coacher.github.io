you've only been able to access them on
your own computer this is known as your
local development environment sometimes
refer to as localhost when working on
your localhost your application code
lives on your computer and is accessed
only by you well what if you wanted to
take your local application and release
it to your users you would need to make
it available on a public computer these
computers are called web servers web
servers will keep your application code
they will run it and deliver pages to
anyone who requests them the process of
moving your code from your computer to a
remote public host is called deployment
this allows other computers across the
internet to access it so when you deploy
your application to a remote host you
now have a version that is publicly
available by anyone with the URL and you
still have the version running on your
local host that you continue tweaking
and testing periodically updating the
public code after you've tested new
updates but wait you may ask yourself
haven't I already done this by pushing
my code up to github good question while
you may have used github as a backup or
collaboration service to keep your code
it's not the same as deploying your code
it would be like keeping your paintings
stacked up in a room for storage instead
of hanging them on the walls and opening
the doors for the public to admire while
serving wine and cheese deploying your
application is a whole production wine
and cheese included that allows your
users to see the excellent work that
you've done</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
