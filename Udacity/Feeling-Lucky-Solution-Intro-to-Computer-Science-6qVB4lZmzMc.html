three inputs the index which is a hash
table of all the keywords and the pages
in which they appear we have the ranks
which rank each page based on the you
rank algorithm that we discussed in
lecture and then we have the keyword we
are searching for the output is going to
be the highest ranking page with that
keyword and the steps to solve this can
briefly be summarized as follows we're
going to go through every page that
contains the keyword and we're just
going to find the page with the maximum
rank so we're going to find a maximum it
sounds pretty simple but it's actually a
few lines of code so let's go right to
the IDE so the first thing we're going
to do is get the pages from the index
with that keyword if there aren't any
pages then we're going to return none
and if there's at least one page we're
going to say for now that the best page
is the first one and we're going to
iterate through each page in the pages
list updating or best page accordingly
so if the rank of the candidate page the
page that we're iterating through is
greater than the rank of our best page
we're going to update our best page and
once we're done we're going to return
the best page</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
