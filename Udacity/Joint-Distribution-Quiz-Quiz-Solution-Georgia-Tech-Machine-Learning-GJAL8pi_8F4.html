the process that I went through is just
going to talk this out I haven't
actually worked it out in my head yet so
what's the probability that there isn't
a storm well the way you have this drawn
it actually makes it pretty easy to see
I can just look at the cases where storm
is false and it turns out there's two of
them and I can just add up those
probabilities over there and I get 0.05
plus 0.3 oh and that gives me point
three five that's great yes so that's
exactly what you did so you went through
and and now all that matters in the
universe are the cases where they're not
a storm and that ended up being these
two numbers and you said well those are
the two different cases it can happen
we'll just add their probabilities
because they're non overlapping and you
got point three five great all right
what about the second question okay so
that's probability that there is
lightning in a world where there is a
storm so I'm gonna do a very similar
trick I'm going to look at the cases
where storm happens to be true and
conveniently they're the first two rows
and I have two cases so we know the
probability there being a storm is 0.65
which is good because 0.65 and point
three five add up to one but that's not
the probability of there being lightning
given there is a storm so of those two
cases there's only one where lightning
is happening wind storm is happening and
that's 0.25 but point two five isn't
enough because it's only 0.25 out of
0.65 so the correct answer would be 0.25
divided by 0.65
which is some number 5 thirteenth's yeah
it's 5 thirteenth's and though I'd
rather that people fill in as a fraction
as a that is a 5 thirteenth's as a
fraction good point as a point something
something a decimal so 5 13 is obviously
0.46 1/5 there you go is that right
yes that was perfect yeah so it's
usually when there's a storm it's not
Lightning II it's less than half the
time that makes sense it does because
otherwise lightning would be happening
all the time well when it's storming it
could be that it's very likely when it's
storming it is like a moon storming but
it wouldn't be happening every single
time it's storming because otherwise it
would be lightning all the time on its
torment and often there's breaks between
lightning in fact most of the time
there's not lightning at least outside
my window at 2:00 p.m.
