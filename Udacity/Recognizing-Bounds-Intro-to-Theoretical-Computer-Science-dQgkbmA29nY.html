300 n plus 12 is contained in O of N
squared because N squared is the
fastest-growing term so it's correct and
it's also the best possible bound
because we have N squared here as the
fastest-growing term and which is
exactly the same that we wrote here the
second one is also correct because n to
the power of three grows faster than N
squared but it's not the best possible
bound we can give because we already
found out that N squared is the best
possible bound that we can give now down
here three to the power of n plus five
and squared minus three n grows much
faster than N squared so this is not
true and of course it cannot be the best
possible bound if it's not a correct
bound at all in the next one three to
the power of n is the fastest-growing
term and this is exactly what we're
stating on the right here so it's
correct and it's also the best possible
bound that we can give the next one
again the bound is correct this is
similar to here when we compared in to
the power of 3/2 N squared so four to
the power of n grows much faster than
three to the power of n but again it's
not the best possible bound because we
already know that three to the N is the
best possible bound that we can give
this one down here is similar to one of
the examples that I just showed you so
we can ignore the constant here and two
to the power of n times N squared grows
faster than two to the power of n so
this is not correct and since it's not
correct it cannot be the best possible
bound now this one down here is probably
a little bit tricky because two point
one to the power of n indeed grows
faster than two to the power of n times
n squared so if you plot those two
functions you can see that two point one
to the power of n will outgrow this funk
this part here two to the power of n
times n squared so it is a correct bound
but it is not the best possible one
because the best possible one would be
two to the power of n times N squared
and not two point one to the power of n
which grows much faster so as you can
see o notation is simply about looking
at which part of a function grows the
fastest and then it's a very convenient
way of actually describing the growth of
that function while ignoring details
that are a bit distracting and not
necessary for the analysis back
going to do in this course now there's
one final note I should make some people
instead of writing FFN is contained in a
o of G of n also write f of n is equal
to o of G of n and sometimes but this is
not very common people will also write
it as if it were a subset so they would
use this symbol here and say it's a
subset contained in F G of n this here
is probably the most correct way to
state it because o of G of n is actually
a set of functions if you were to
consider it mathematically but this one
appear equals o of G of n is also very
common one that you can also find in
many scientific papers and even teaching
books</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
