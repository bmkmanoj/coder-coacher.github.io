market again we use Southwest as a
low-cost entrant or Whole Foods as a
unique niche supplier for your
positioning but you really want to start
asking is what factors can you eliminate
that your industry is long competed on
or what can you reduce below the
industry standard or raised above the
industry standard or what can be created
that the industry's never offered now
what's interesting is if you look at the
chasm between your early adopters your
early Vangelis and the mainstream market
in a reset mminton market this is what
more was kind of talking about called
the chasm there really is a gap between
what these people want and a gap between
their needs and if you're not careful
your sales curve would start looking
like this over here actually might
collapse until the mainstream adopts so
let's take a look at what a sales curve
might look like in a reset mented market
and it's a complex sales growth chart
because in the first couple of years
you're just kind of getting the
spillover of people who kind of think
you're just a competitor in the existing
market and your sales will kind of total
along until if you're correct and you
were right about that niche or low-cost
segmentation you will start seeing an
exponential increase in sales and if
you're wrong well you'll just kind of be
one of the many competitors in an
existing market</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
