app for geofencing you'll need a Google
API client you've seen these earlier in
the course and you've seen how to set
them up so let's assume at this point
that you've done that in order for your
app to monitor the geofences you have to
define them and a geofence is defined
using the geofence object which you
create using a geofence builder it takes
the following properties latitude and
longitude define where the geofence is
on the world these are just the typical
latitude and longitude that define any
location anywhere the radius defines a
circular area around the latitude and
longitude this determines how close the
user needs to be to that location from
any direction before any alert gets
triggered the expiration time determines
how long the fence should remain active
once this time expires the geofence is
deleted and you can of course set up
permanent ones if you like and the
geofence ID is an identifier to use so
that you can know which geofence has
been triggered this should be unique if
you consider the fact that geo fences
are based on latitude and longitude and
a circle around them you can actually
have geo fences that overlap each other
I'm gonna user enters a particular space
they may trigger two or more geo fences
as such as a developer you may want to
know which ones and you do that using
the ID of the Geo fence now I'm going to
define it your fences looking something
like this
you can then define a number of geo
fences as an array of Geo fence objects
so I'm gonna wrap the list of geo fences
an ArrayList like this once you have
your ArrayList of geo fences you can
then use a geo fencing request class but
simply by calling its add geo fences
method and passing the ArrayList to it
once this is working you can then add
the geo fencing request to your client
and specify a pending intent that is
used to process the callbacks from the
location services API this pending
intent uses an intense service in a
similar way to the address example that
we saw earlier now whenever a geo
fencing action happens the intent
service will catch it and it will route
it to your app</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
