economics for direct sales let's go take
a look at what the channel economics
would look like if we were selling
through an indirect channel resellers so
as you could see we still have the same
cost of goods to manufacture the product
that's before $33 now what's kind of
interesting is if we look at the Rd
selling cost and general administration
cost our Rd might be the same and
keeping the lights on the building might
be the same but our selling costs are
lower because we're selling through
resellers we still need a direct
salesperson but this time instead of
them talking to every possible end user
they're actually talking to a few number
of resellers so let's say instead of $20
our SG&amp;amp;A sales general and admin cost
plus Rd this time it's $15 rather than
20 and that the total of getting the
product out the door is now $48 just
like before our list price is $100 and
in the store the end user expects maybe
a 10% discount and so the revenue to the
sales channel this time not to us is $90
but this time we have resellers and the
resellers don't work for us they're the
ones actually selling the product and
they take the difference between $90 and
let's say $70 which they're gonna pay us
and so their profit is $20 for caring
stocking and reselling our product and
our profit is just $22 this time because
we're selling through someone else but
remember our costs were lower so one of
the trade-offs in using what's called an
indirect channel is that your selling
costs are lower but you're giving a big
chunk of your profit to other people not
part of your company</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
