which you're very famous for to creating
thermostats and she's also very famous
for it looks like a decent a soup of the
surface these products seem completely
different well they are well they're on
the surface level and the markets
everything are completely different the
difference is and I said earlier is it
first started with frustration so the
ipod was born out of for me the
frustration i had is a DJ I had to carry
all these CDs around I was mad I was
frustrated I couldn't get all the music
i wanted it was heavy was cumbersome i
had to go find things and i couldn't be
as good a DJ as I wanted so I that was
the frustration my curiosity and then
solution the thermostat I was sick and
tired of paying so much money for a for
energy to heat my home or cool my home
and yet it wasn't very comfortable and
every time I left it you know it didn't
turn off and I was just paste I was mad
so you know fifty percent of the money
we spent on energy every year was due to
this thermostat and it was ugly so I was
frustrated then curious then solution as
interested because the thermostat I
think broke many of the roads in Silicon
Valley it was because of the fact that
people every month would get a bill our
energy bill and they would just be
frustrating they just had to you know
pay it and they would just they didn't
know what they were doing it was just
like I gotta pay this and he just
couldn't take it so each month when they
get that bill that's the frustration we
just had to make sure we had a great
product that could deliver on the
marketing message and make sure they
heard the message whether they were in a
store or online or what have you so we
just had to tap in and I call this the
virus of doubt what's the pain point and
make sure you're a pain killer not a
vitamin so the pain was the energy bill
and then we said we had we had the the
antidote for them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
