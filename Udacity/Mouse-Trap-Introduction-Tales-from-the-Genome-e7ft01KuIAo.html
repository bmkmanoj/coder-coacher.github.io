thinking this is a really great analogy
for how the human body works it's just a
board game well sure but I mean think
about it from the outside looking in
it's a lot like the human body can seem
really complicated like a like a Rube
Goldberg machine what's that well you
know something where there's a seemingly
simple task right there's just a trap
coming down but there's a ton of energy
dependent steps that have to be
accomplished for us to get to this
simple outcome i won you did win now
although it looks complicated if we
remove just one piece from the machine
here we can totally alter the end
outcome or the end result so let's do it
again and remove this little diver man
okay so I see the whole game is like the
human body but there's obviously a lot
more genes in the human body than there
are individual pieces in the game sounds
like something a geneticist would say
that's exactly right but a geneticist
doesn't study all the genes at once they
still use the one gene at a time
approach meaning that they remove one
piece and they see what happens now if
you remove one piece and you actually
can see a visible overall effect then
you know you've got something important
to the whole process and this is
actually what geneticists call a
monogenic trade a monogenic trait is
whenever one gene has a variation that
affects the overall outcome or phenotype
this lesson is dedicated to inherited
traits that are influenced by single
genes or monogenic traits we're going to
cover traits like red-green
colorblindness dwarfism osteogenesis
imperfecta and sickle cell anemia for
each of these traits were going to
uncover some of the genetic variations
that cause these traits and then also
examine the dominance of these various
alleles that contribute to an individual
phenotype here's the concept map for
lesson eight as always I want you to
print it out and try to fill in the
blanks on your own as we go through the
lesson then in the end you'll have a
chance to see how you did there'll be a
complete version of the map waiting for
you at the end</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
