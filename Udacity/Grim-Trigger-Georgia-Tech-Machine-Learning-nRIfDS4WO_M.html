of the folk theorem is you could prove
it with a little strategy that is
referred to as grim trigger mmm I like
that like the way the sounds so here's
here's the basic structure of grim
trigger it says that what we're gonna do
is we're gonna start off taking some
kind of action or pattern of actions
it's of mutual benefit and as long as
this cooperation continues this mutual
beneficial behavior will continue but
however if you ever cross the line and
fail to cooperate with me then I will
deal out vengeance against you forever
hmm
so once again we're talking about my
ex-girlfriends I don't know why you're
obsessed with this maybe it's just maybe
it's just trying to help you understand
so you know kind of what this situation
is anyway here's here's what that looks
like in the context of prisoner's
dilemma right so cooperation is the is
the mutually beneficial action and as
long as you continue to cooperate with
me that's this see arrow here then I
will continue to cooperate with you but
if you ever defect on me I swear I will
spend the rest of my life making you pay
so no matter what you do at this point
defect or cooperate I will just continue
to defect on you pain will rain from the
sky okay well this makes sense so the
idea here is that if you know that I'm
going to do this then hopefully it makes
sense for us to continue to mutually
benefit right so the whole purpose of
this is to create a Nash equilibrium
kind of situation right where if I'm
playing this strategy and you're playing
this strategy then neither of us has any
incentive to cross the line and so we're
just going to continue to cooperate
crossing the line is going to decrease
your reward so there's no benefit to
doing it so you won't do it so it's it's
nice because it gets us a Nash
equilibrium hmm but there's a problem
with it of course and you pointed it out
before so let's let's dive in and make
sure that we understand it and see if we
can fix it okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
