we first have to represent it using a
string
notice that this represents an immediate
challenge our universal Turing machine
must use the fixed alphabet for its
input and have a fixed number of states
but it must be able to simulate Turing
machines with arbitrarily large
alphabets and an arbitrary number of
states as well see one solution is
essentially to enumerate all the symbols
and States and represent them in binary
there are lots of ways to do this the
way we're going to do it is a compromise
of readability and efficiency so we'll
let M be a Turing machine with states q0
through QA minus 1 and we'll let it stay
alphabet B gamma a1 through a.m. we'll
define I and J so that to the AI is at
least the number of states and 2 to the
J is at least the size of the tape
alphabet then we can encode a state QK
as the string Q W where W is the binary
representation of K for example if the
number of states is 6 then we would need
I to be 3 and so we would encode Q 3 as
the string Q and then 3 written out in
binary 0 1 1 by the way we'll use the
convention that Q followed by the binary
representation of 0 is the initial state
Q followed by the binary representation
of one is the accept state and Q
followed by the binary representation of
2 is the rejects name we encode symbols
much in the same way as we encoded
States will use a followed by W where W
is the binary representation of this K
to indicate the K symbol for example if
there are 10 different symbols then we
need 4 bits to represent them all and we
might encode a 5 which could be any
symbol maybe it's a star we would encode
that as the string a followed by that
binary representation of 5 4 plus 1 is 5
let's see an encoding for an example
this example decides whether the input
consists of a number of zeros that is a
power of 2
to encode the Turing machine as a whole
we really just need to encode the
transition function
we'll start by considering this edge
here we're going from state zero so I'll
write that this way we see the symbol
zero so I'll write the encoding for that
like so and then we're going to state
three
so I'll write out that here and then we
need to write the dollar sign
so I'll write out the encoding for that
like so and we're supposed to move to
the right so I'll write the R there
remember that the order is input state
input symbol output state output symbol
and then Direction next let's do this
blue transition here we go from state
three and we read a zero
so I encode that that way and then we're
going to state four so I'll write the
encoding for that right with Q followed
by the binary representation of four and
we're supposed to write X so I look up
the encoding for X that's a one zero
like so and we want to move the head to
the right
so I include an R here so that's the
convention we'll use to write out the
transition function it's just a sequence
of these five tuples of this form input
state input symbol output state output
symbol and then direction</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
