computations that on the surface don't
appear to have any parallelism in the
process you'll learn what I think are
some really neat tricks about how to
extract parallelism when it's not
obvious how to do so as a teaser I want
you to imagine the following scenario
suppose you're standing in an absurdly
long line in a very large room the room
is completely dark so you can't see
anything maybe you're waiting in line at
the registrar's office to pick up your
own SCS degree you ask yourself how many
people are in front of me in this line
and to find out you can only talk to the
person right in front of you or right
behind you that's not so hard you say
after all you're young smug and smart
and you know that the first person knows
that she's the first person so she can
turn to her neighbor behind her and say
hey I'm number one that person now knows
that he must be number two so he pays it
forward or in this case backwards and
tells his position to the next person
and it goes on and on like this now
that's a lovely and simple solution to
this problem but suppose there are 10
million people in this line if it takes
one second to do an information exchange
then it's gonna take about 10 million
people times 1 second divided by 3,600
seconds per hour divided by 24 hours per
day or 115 days for the last person in
line to learn that he or she is number
10 million that person in nearly 4
months time could have probably finished
a whole other ohm SCS degree now this
scenario is an analogy for a well known
problem in parallel algorithms called
list ranking you are given a singly
linked list and a pointer to the head
what you want to compute is the position
of every node in the list sequentially
it's trivial to do but if you have
multiple processors can you use
parallelism to do it faster you might
want to pause the video for a second and
see if you can think of a way and unless
you already know how I bet you'll have a
very hard time doing so to get an
efficient parallel scheme what you might
find is that everything you've been told
about the best way to store a linked
list is completely wrong file it
underlies my other teachers told me so
without further ado let's see if we can
undo a couple years of bad
control computing habits</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
