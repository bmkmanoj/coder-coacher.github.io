getting this far we still got a ways to
go and now the question is what do we do
next it may seem a little bit daunting
that there's so much to do and when I
get that feeling I remember the book
bird by bird by Annie Lamott very funny
book and in it she relates the story of
how when she was in elementary school
and there was a big book report due
where she had to write up descriptions
of multiple different birds and she was
behind and it was soo soon and she went
to her father and complained how am I
ever going to get done I'm behind and
her father just told her bird by bird
just go and take the first bird write up
a report on that and then take the next
bird off the list and keep continuing
until you're done so let's go bird by
bird and finish this up what do we have
left to do well we got to figure out how
to put letters on one particular row
while dealing with the crosswords then
we got to expand from that to all the
rows then we got to do the columns as
well then we got to worry about the
scoring and there's a couple of minor
things we put off like dealing with the
blanks so that's a lot to do let's go
bird by bird</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
