we're going to talk about one particular
framework as an example it's just as an
example there are other frameworks that
provide similar functionality to the Jie
framework which is called the Java
Enterprise Edition framework and in the
Jie framework there are four containers
for constructing an application service
and containers you can think of as
protection domains implemented typically
in a java virtual machine in the j ee
version of building entire applications
there are four containers there is a
client container and there is an applet
container for the client which will
reside typically on a web server and
this is the one that interacts with the
browser on the end client and the
presentation logic that I mentioned to
you earlier is provided in a container
which is called a web container and this
is a guy that is responsible for
dynamically perhaps creating the pages
that have to be sent by the web server
back to the browser of the client and
there is an EJB container which is the
one that manages the business logic that
corresponds to what needs to be done in
order to carry out the request that has
come in from the end client and there
may be a database server that the
business logic is communicating with in
order to get access to the data that it
needs to process the requests that came
in so these are the four containers a
client container the applet container
the web container and the EJB container
that are the containers that are
available for packaging the objects that
constitute the entir
application for providing a particular
service for example airline reservation
service or a hotel reservation service
the key hope is that we want to exploit
as much as possible reuse of components
and for this purpose continuing sort of
the coffee analogy starting with java
the word bean is used to indicate a unit
of reuse that is a bun
of Java objects providing a specific
functionality for example there may be a
beam that provides the shopping cart
function so that becomes a unit of reuse
in constructing an entire application
the containers that I talked about here
host the beans that is a container
allows you to package a whole bunch of
Java beans and make it available in this
container in the Jie framework there are
four types of beans one type of bean is
called an entity bean for instance an
entity bean may be a role of a database
if you think about the database is
holding employee records for instance
one row of the database may correspond
to all the employees whose last name
starts with the alphabet in and
typically entity beans are persistent
objects with primary keys and the
persistence for the entity being may be
built into the bean itself and that is
what is called being managed persistence
or it may be built into the container
into which that entity being is
instantiated in either case since we are
dealing with objects that may need
persistence it is important that that
persistence for that object is handled
somewhere either in the entity itself or
the container into which that entity is
being hosted the second type of bean is
what is called a session bean and the
session bean typically is associated
with a particular client and a
particular session
meaning a temporal window over which the
client is interacting with the service
that is what a session bean may be
holding and a session bean could be a
stateful session bean meaning for
instance I am ordering let's say a
computer by contacting a portal for Dell
in that case the session that I am
establishing with the Dell portal that
session has to be stateful because it
has to remember what choices I'm making
I may actually keep those choices alive
go away for a while
back the next day and continue with my
purchase so sessions could be stateful
there could also be stateless session
for instance if I start an email session
using my browser with Google using Gmail
that session may be stateless I go away
everything that I did during that
session can be thrown away because I'm
gonna start a brand new session when I
really shade a connection with the Gmail
server so in that sense a session bean
could be a stateful session bean or a
stateless session bean and the third
type of bean is what is called a message
driven bean this kind of bean is useful
for asynchronous behavior for instance I
might be interested in getting the stock
quotes I might have a stock quote
thicker on my browser and I might want
to get updates on the movement of stocks
of a particular company that I'm
interested in and that would be
something that is accomplished using a
message bean which is having this
asynchronous behavior stock ticker is an
example news feed as an example RSS
feeds that you typically are using these
days are examples of message driven
beings and the finer we make these beans
each of these beans is the loading a
functionality but if you can have fine
grained versions of these beans that
gives a greater opportunity to enhance
the concurrency for dealing with an
individual request that's coming into
your application server or there could
be concurrent requests in addition to my
own request there could be parallel
requests coming in all of those can be
dealt with more concurrently if we
implement these beans at a finer level
of granularity but if you implement the
bean at a finer level of granularity
that means that the business logic is
also getting more complex so there is
always this trade-off in structuring and
clear applications that we may have a
complex business logic in order to
support finer grained concurrency or you
might choose to keep the business logic
very simple and use coarse grain beans
and this is where the core of
what we are going to discuss lies and
that is we are going to discuss
different design alternatives for
structuring such entire application
servers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
