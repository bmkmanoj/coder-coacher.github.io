transition between view controllers as a
segue these segways are depicted using
this gray arrow that's interrupted by
this circular icon you can see a lot of
segues and storyboard for this make your
own adventure app which you'll see a lot
more of if you stick around for lesson
five here in the roll the dice method of
our role view controller dot Swift file
we saw how to present view controllers
programmatically now we're going to move
on to a second way of presenting view
controllers by combining code with a
storyboard segue now I don't want any
tears but first we have to delete all of
the code in our roll the dice method
back in storyboard we're going to open
up our pop-up menu for the role view
controller and under triggered segues
we're going to drag this manual segue to
the dice view controller here we have a
few options for the segue I'm going to
choose modal here but we'll talk more
about the push and custom options when
we get into the navigation lesson next
we need to set the storyboard identifier
for our segue so let's close this
outline view and open up the utilities
pain and then if we click on the segue
we can see in the attributes of
inspector where we can set the
storyboard identifier so we'll call it
roll dice now we have our segue from
storyboard but we need to write the code
that calls it we want the segue to
happen when the dice is rolled so we go
into the roll the dice method in our
role view controller dot Swift file here
we're going to invoke the method perform
segue with identifier and our identifier
of course is roll dice and our sender is
self ok let's run it and see what
happens when we roll the dice you can
see that a new view is appearing but
otherwise no dice why would that be well
we never set their values in fact our
first view controller never even had a
reference to the dice view controller
let alone the dice so how are we going
to set those dice values let's leave
that question open for now and pause to
review the steps for creating the segue</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
