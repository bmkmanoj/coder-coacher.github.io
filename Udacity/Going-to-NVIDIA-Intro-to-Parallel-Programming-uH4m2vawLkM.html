before you came to Nvidia so for 26
years I was a professor first at MIT for
11 years and at Stanford for 15 years
and I taught courses on computer
architecture and parallel computing and
led a research group that built a lot of
interesting parallel computers and
developed many interesting programming
systems for them including some early
object-oriented parallel programming
systems concurrent small talk and
current aggregates some stream
programming systems dream see Colonel
Seabrook and Sequoia and that that
sequence of programming systems
ultimately led to Takuto which was sort
of done by the the same person who had
done Brook a stream programming language
we did at Stanford during that period of
time I also was a consultant for
industry working for numerous companies
particularly for Cray i worked with
Crais insulate 1980s into the middle of
the 2000s helping them develop
interesting parallel computer systems</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
