color that is representative of your
apps branding or personality you can use
this color in large blocks such as this
toolbar to make your app instantly
recognizable for example you choose
primary color would be red or in boxes
color would be blue next you pick an
accent color this is a brighter more
saturated color designed to draw
attention to certain elements such as a
floating action button two colors alone
may not be enough range to create your
whole UI so we then break these down
into lightness ranges to build out your
palette here's an example of materials
like blue color swatch maternal assigns
numerical values to this range where
lighter shades have a lower number and
darker shades have a higher number these
numbers themselves don't mean anything
intrinsically but they're useful
terminology when discussing when to use
a particular tint we calibrate our
lightness scale on your primary color
calling it the 500 shade then darker
shades have higher numbers like 700 or
900 and lighter shades have lower
numbers we use an a prefix for those
accent those more saturated and colors
that we talked about such as light blue
a 200 now we recommend that you stick to
free use of your primary and 1 accent
color to keep your palette simple but
versatile for example let's create a
palette for an app which has an indigo
personality
I'll pick indigo 500 shade is my primary
color and then grab the indigo 700 and
300 shades for complementary areas next
I'll pick pink a 200 as a hot accent
color for contrasting elements let's
apply our shiny new palette to our app
we can use the primary color in blocks
of your UI like extended toolbars to
embed our personality next we could
apply the 700 shade to the status bar to
give it contrast against the toolbar and
then the 300 shade for a block of
secondary information for example
finally we'll use the accent color on
elements you want to call out such as
the fab on toggles or perhaps a focus
text field material provides a
and tune palette of colors that you can
use in your apps and are a great
starting point if you don't have an
existing brand if you do however then
you absolutely should use your own brand
colors but applying the material system
of accents and shades helps to work this
into your UI if you have a primary color
but no accent then you can use color
theory such as complementary colors to
help you pick one there's some great
tools online this is an example from
Colorado be calm if you really want a
monochromatic palette so just one color
in there it's fine to use two shades
with your primary color but then you're
going to lose the ability to highlight
in certain elements a quick tip is that
you'll likely use your accent color
close to or on top of your primary color
so for example the fab on top of this
toolbar here so you want to make sure
you pick colors that have enough
contrast so this woman would get a
little bit lost so that's the essence of
working with color and material design
the system is powerful and massive and
completely adaptable to your application
so no matter if your app is whimsical or
serious it's easy to work with color to
express that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
