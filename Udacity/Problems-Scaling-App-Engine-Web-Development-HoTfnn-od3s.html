and improved maybe we can talk about
some of the the kind of the downsides
the thing you have to the things are a
little bit more difficult than app
engine you know as a result of of you
know how its set up and how its designed
the happy path is paved with concrete
and has chains along the sides and so
you really can't leave the happy path so
that's something you have to keep in
mind the and there are failures from
time to time that you know a query can
work just fine and then also the next
time you make exactly that you know the
same call it doesn't work you know and
those are just you know things that you
get in a big eventually consistent kind
of amorphous sort of machine and so you
have to deal with those and so you start
to you know a lot of times you kind of
want to do a looping sort of query where
you know you're willing to do the query
three times and you know within the
three times would probably get the
result and the first one might you know
fail be just read you know Reaper form
the same query before you let your
request handler send response back or an
error response back to the user and so
which is actually kind of a good pattern
because it you know just distributed
computing you're going to encounter
failures and so you and you need to
program defensively for those you know
like systems sort of failures so you
know so being ready to do a you know an
issuer to retry and kind of putting that
into your normal you know call stack or
your framework I guess you know it's
easy to do but it is something that you
know if when you really want your app to
start running smoothly and those are the
sorts of things you know do the asset is
dealing with they're learning about now
to do the retries on things like queries
you have to be cognizant of how long a
long-running task on a back-end is going
to take you get a limit of I think it's
ten minutes and which seems like a long
time but on highly virtualized system
you can actually you know have a 10
minute long running task see if they be
prepared to shut it off early and then
be ready to pick it back up with a
subsequent request
I can so one of the other things I guess
would be a lot of people wanting you
know when you get a bigger Python system
you want to have C modules
you know pre compiled and you don't get
that so you know you kind of forget
about those sorts of things and then the
biggest one which I know that Google is
addressing and they have a beta program
which and it so I'm very hopeful that it
happens soon is a better ssl certificate
support especially for the custom domain
you know get ssl on you know domain
appspot.com but if you point a custom
domain to it you you don't get SSL
support for that which is a big drawback
and it's something they obviously
recognize and they are fixing cool so
hopefully in time please Google that
will be there so one thing that I was
skeptical about coming in is the is the
database and how much access you have to
your your own data are there any kind of
you know limitations there that need to
be thought about definitely and that
would something that's probably worthy
of a whole unit and of course of about
going deeper with with App Engine there
are a few I think things that you kind
of have to come to terms with and
they're trade-offs every life is
trade-offs right especially with scaling
on a website and for a lot you have to
put up with things like all queries have
a limit of a thousand records and that's
before paging which kind of sucks so you
can if you you could potentially pull
out you know a result set that was a
thousand none up with just empty records
and then you have to page to the next
one to get the three that that matched
so depending on how it is that the
indexing in in your your collections or
your model I guess is structured the
backup and restore thing is real awkward
there's not really there's some backup
and restore utilities built in but not
you know if you wanted to just take the
data on a nightly basis and sync it to a
testing kind of QA sort of like a prod
QA sort of version of your app you know
so and there are some you know tools out
there that you know basically allow you
to export the data as pi
on code and then you could run it you
know and and import it into another app
but in the back of your head which is
you know I'm the one hand it's nice to
have some transparent costs you know we
can tell you pretty much exactly how
much every one of our queries you know
costs which is great the downside is
that when you're doing something like a
backup fit in the back of your mind
you're going man this is costing a lot
of money you know and so that so it's
you know things you can get around but
but not as smoothly as you know just
taking you know you know in a hot pack
up of your you know the local files on a
bicycle database something like that the
other one is that there's no real great
data viewer you know there are times
when you're troubleshooting you just you
know you really don't know what's going
on you want to just issue some sequel
queries or some Mongo queries directly
against the data to see what the data
looks like and then there's a data
viewer on you know on there the
dashboard but it's not that great it's
you know and it only works with certain
kinds of data types and you can't really
update anything so if you really just
need to flip some field you know the
status of something and just that way
you can keep processing and then you can
work on fixing your bug and getting it
out you know later that day or tomorrow
or whatever you just you don't you can't
do that and which is frustrating and but
you know that on the other hand it might
force you to build some more interest
rate 'iv kind of features that if you
can fix things easily with some duct
tape you end up kind of not really
building a good administrative interface
so sometimes when the only way you can
do it is by building an administrative
interface okay yes so some of those
limitations seem to you know not be
without reason but you know they are
limitations yeah it was funny when we
were talking before this some of you
guys had mentioned that you know if they
were designing a website or they're
building a website that needed to scale
to many many users App Engine would be
you know a great choice and then I kind
of mentioned you know well if I was
building a toy website App Engine would
be my first go-to so I'd have to deal
with any of that you know crud of data
installing data bases in memcache and
app servers and frameworks and so the
deploy process all that oh yeah
deployment man we spend that's something
we haven't touched on on this or in any
of my unit
is when you start having multiple
machines deploying code across multiple
machines is something that you have to
think about in there's different
strategies and versioning is stuff is
cool in App Engine so I want to thank
you for doing this with us this is
really cool I've learned a lot from
talking to you guys about how App Engine
works and I hope the students have have
got some better perspective on and
whether App Engine is the right choice
for them
I was really thank you for having me and
thank you for your class it's a really
great feedback and goals been fun having
this sort of class cool glad to hear and
so that wraps it up for unit 7 which
wraps it up for the whole course so you
know thank you everybody for
participating this far if you made it
this far you are you are a champion of
web applications and you know the only
thing left for you is the final which
we'll get to next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
