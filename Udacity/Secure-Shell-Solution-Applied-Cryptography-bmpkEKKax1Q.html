one is checking the signature we're
checking the signature here by
decrypting using the public key that
verifies that this message was created
by someone who knows the private key so
we verified the signature and you might
think that would be enough we verify the
signature we obtain the public key and
we obtain the value that we need to
produce our diffie-hellman key the
reason that's not enough is because
we're all so worried about replay
attacks and that's why we need to do the
second check we're going to recompute
this hash note that the hash is one-way
we can't use the hash to learn the key
but we can compute the key like this for
the client and then check that the key
and the hash and matches that by
computing the hash we know that there's
no replay attack because these values
are fresh if there was a replay attack
and a different hash value was replayed
well then this hash wouldn't match so we
need both of those the third check
doesn't make sense and this uses YC as
well as XS which is the secret value of
the server if that was revealed that
would break the protocol</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
