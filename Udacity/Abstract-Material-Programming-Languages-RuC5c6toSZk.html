noticed that units three and four were
quite abstract will the remaining units
and the course be similarly abstract
that is a good question units three and
four were relatively abstract to some
degree intentionally so we wanted to
cover the basics of grammars
context-free grammars how we might parse
them ourselves when we talk to a
particular algorithm for that in class
and then how to interface with a tool
that uses a similar algorithm and then
given a context-free grammar and a
description of how to build a parse tree
or an abstract syntax tree puts it all
together that was difficult material and
if you thought it seemed a little more
abstract than the rest of the course you
are absolutely right and part of that is
that we want to challenge you this is a
world class education and these are the
sort of concepts that we would go into
at a top tier University covering these
topics we want to make sure that you
understand languages from the inside out
and thus that you can manipulate in your
mind grammar rules the backbones the
essential syntactic constructs of
languages we want you to know them how
to change them how to implement them
that said the course really does go up
and then go back down a bit in terms of
level of abstraction or difficulty in
units 5 &amp;amp; 6 we're going to turn our
attention to interpreting parse trees
interpreting abstract syntax trees what
comes next after a parser well we try to
figure out the meaning of a program will
look at interpreting HTML interpreting
JavaScript as well as fun off to the
side software engineering tasks like
debugging programs and also optimizing
them to make them go faster I think
you'll suck I think you'll find that
units 5 &amp;amp; 6 will be significantly more
concrete and grounded than units three
and four and possibly even little easier</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
