especially well in situations where the
tests are also generated automatic if
you have taken a testing class recently
you may have heard about first test
first testing is a technique where you
generate a random inputs for a program
or an API it's a common testing method
to see whether something breaks to show
you how fast testing works let's first
write a fuzzer which is a function which
generates such a random inputs so here's
our Father function you want to have a
function that generates strings of up to
1,023 characters filled with regular
printable ascii symbols so first we
determine the string length would like
to have and for that simply take a
random number random but random returns
a random number between 0 and 1 and
multiply this with 1024 so we get a
length of up to 1,023 characters and
here we have a simple loop over the
string length we generate a character
which takes the an arbitrary value
between 32 and 128 by using again the
random function multiplied with 96 a
1032 we add the character to the out
string and return the out string at the
end let's see what fuzzer produces press
on run and here we have a nice train
filled with random characters if we
invoke it again we're going to get
another random string and here we go I
think what happens if i take such a
random string and paste it into a
function that accepts say a file name or
an email address or a URL all of these
functions work well even when confounded
with seemingly totally random input in
the age of the Internet any input that
is under control by third parties can
easily look like this and fuss testing
is indeed one of the attack vectors of
people wanting to penetrate into your
system</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
