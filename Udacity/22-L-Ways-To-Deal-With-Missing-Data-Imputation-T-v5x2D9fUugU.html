with example survey data that has
missing values one way to deal with
these missing values is just to
eliminate any observations that have
missing data but because of the
negatives related to that we might want
to keep all the observations and just
try to fill in the blanks so to speak
the important thing here is to provide
the fake data so that our model can get
closer to what's actually true one
common method is to replace the missing
values with a predefined statistic the
mean median or mode as a reminder to all
of us the mean is the average of the
values technically it's where we add up
all the existing values and divide them
by the number of values you have the
median is the midpoint of the data
values to determine this you basically
put all the values in order and then
select the value that's halfway between
the first and the last values the mode
is the most common of the data values in
other words it's the value that occurs
most often in the data set if you
remember in one of our previous segments
we showed what the real ages were for
respondents number 3 and number 9 I've
gone ahead and added in the rest of the
real data for the purpose of our example
if you recall in that segment the
average or mean age for the known
respondents was 40 if we impute 40 for
all the missing age values and impute
the average income for each of the
missing income values which in this case
is 60,000 we can then see the effect
that it has in comparison to using the
delete method for dealing with the
missing data here we see a scatter plot
of the real data the slope of the line
would indicate in general that as age
increases so does income but if we look
at the scatterplot where we just delete
records that have missing data we can
see that this scatter plot of the
leftover data actually has the slope of
the line going in the wrong direction
indicating that as age increases income
goes
down and when we add in a scatter plot
of the imputed data using the averages
of the existing data we find that though
it may not be quite accurate it at least
gets us going in the right direction as
to the slope of the line the imputed
data model isn't perfect but it does
seem to get us closer in this specific
case let's put what we've learned
together in the form of a quiz</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
