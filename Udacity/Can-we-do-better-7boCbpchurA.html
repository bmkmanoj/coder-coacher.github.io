portfolios this way they would look at a
bunch of assets essentially equally
weight them and end up with a portfolio
that behaved somewhat in between now if
you wanted a low-risk portfolio you
should focus on assets that are low-risk
out here if you wanted for instance high
return you should focus on assets over
here and in both those cases you would
end up with a portfolio you know say
here or portfolio say here now can we do
better in other words is it possible to
get portfolios over here so can we have
a portfolio here that has a return
similar to these assets over here but
risk similar to these assets over here
indeed we can and it's due to a man
named Harry Markowitz who won the Nobel
Prize for his insight what he discovered
and what people have been overlooking
was the relationship between stocks in
terms of covariance so the resulting
performance of a portfolio especially in
terms of risk is not just a factor or a
blend of the various risks but it has to
do with how they interact day to day so
indeed if we pick the right stocks in
the right proportions we can get a
portfolio that performs over here that
in fact can have lower risk than any of
the individual assets and I'll show you
how to do that in just a moment before I
do that I want to mention though one
other thing about Harry Markowitz up
until the time of his discovery most
people viewed bonds as the lowest risk
asset in other words if you wanted low
risk you should use bonds only
Markowitz showed that a blend of stocks
and bonds is actually lower risk than
either one of those by themselves and
I'll show you how that makes sense in a
moment</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
