inequality is the interval from negative
infinity to negative 7 thirds unioned
with the interval from 1 to infinity
let's see how we got that when I see an
absolute value inequality with a greater
than or equal I know that I'm going to
have a union which means i have to
separate this into two different cases
and connect them with an order so i'm
going to write my two cases right here
the first case is 3x plus 2 is greater
than or equal to 5 it's exactly the same
as the original problem without the
absolute value and then i need to or the
second case is going to be the absolute
value or 3x plus 2 and we have to switch
the direction of the inequality and we
have to change the sign so the absolute
value of 3x plus 2 is greater than or
equal to 5 is the same as the compound
inequality 3x plus 2 is greater than or
equal to 5 or 3x plus 2 is less than or
equal to negative 5 remember when we're
solving compound inequalities we need to
solve each of these inequalities
independently so let's start with this
one i can subtract two from both sides
and i get 3x is greater than or equal to
3 and divide both sides by 3 and i get x
is greater than or equal to 1 for the
second inequality i do the same thing by
subtracting 2 from both sides and i get
3x is less than or equal to negative 7 /
sides by 3 and i get x is less than or
equal to negative 7 thirds if I want to
draw this on the number line and put 0
right here here's one and negative 7
thirds is equal to negative two and
one-third to graph X is greater than or
equal to 1 on the number line I use a
square bracket and I know I want
everything greater than to graph X is
less than or equal to negative two and a
third I go about negative two and a
third and since x is less than I want to
go in that direction
and that's how we get our interval
notation here we have negative infinity
to negative 7 thirds with a square
bracket because it's less than or equal
to and I Union that with the interval
from 1 to infinity again with a square
bracket because it's greater than or
equal to let's try one more absolute
value inequality</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
