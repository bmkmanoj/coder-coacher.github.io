operations I'm going to start with in
any parentheses I have I need to
simplify this container so I'm going to
leave the three on the outside now i
have 4 times 2 cubed or 4 times 2 to the
third i know i have a choice this too
could go with multiplication or with
exponents the power i know it should go
with the power because powers take
priority so i have 4 times 2 cubed
israeli 2 times 2 times 2 or 8 minus 20
times two okay let's keep going with
simplifying this parentheses I have
three on the outside now with this aight
i have a choice it can be paired with
multiplication or subtraction I know
multiplication comes first so I'm going
to have 32 minus 20 times two I do this
multiplication before I do the
subtraction my parentheses is getting
smaller which is good now the next
choice I have to make is with the 20
should it go with multiplication or with
subtraction I know that multiplication
comes first before addition or
subtraction so have three on the outside
32-40 we're almost done 32-40 I know
that's negative 8 so I have three on the
outside times negative 8 alright if you
have trouble with this part here's what
you can do remember subtraction is the
same thing as adding the opposite i
could have 32 plus negative 40
subtracting positive 40 is the same
thing as adding negative 40 when i think
about these two numbers I know 40s more
negative so I'm going to have eight more
negatives than 32 so I get negative 8
and 3 times negative 8 is negative 24 if
you got negative 24 nice work</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
