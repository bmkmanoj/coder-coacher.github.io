ancient Jewish texts was found in a
series of caves along the Dead Sea these
972 texts are known as the Dead Sea
Scrolls and they had a huge impact on
history linguistics and religious
studies of course reading the content of
these texts was very important but
estimating their age was also really
vital the way that that was done was
through carbon dating so what is carbon
dating well it's a technique used to
find the age of any organic material
that's up to 58 thousand years old this
is done by considering the ratio of
carbon-14 to carbon-12 in the material
now if you're not super comfortable with
chemistry that is not a big deal at all
and waiting to give you all the
information you need in this problem to
figure everything out you don't have to
be an expert on carbon dating what
happens is that over time the amount of
carbon 12 stays pretty constant but the
amount of carbon-14 decreases these
atoms decay so the older something is
the smaller this ratio will be one scrap
of parchment from the dead sea scrolls
is found to have a ratio of carbon-14 to
carbon twelve point seven nine five
times that found in plants alive today
now if this ratio for plants alive today
is one atom of carbon 14 for every 10 to
the 12 atoms of carbon 12 what is the
same ratio for the parchment</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
