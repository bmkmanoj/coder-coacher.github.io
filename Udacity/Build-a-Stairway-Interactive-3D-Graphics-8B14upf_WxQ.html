to well not heaven but at least to a
gold cup a virtual gold cup this
exercise gets you familiar with how most
of three JSS geometric objects work
you'll be spending your time working
inside the create stairs function we're
going to use the cube geometry method to
create two pieces four steps a vertical
piece and a horizontal plank cube
geometry is not a perfect name since the
cube is defined as having all its
dimensions be the same size box geometry
would have been better but no big deal
here's the code for defining the
geometry for our two steps the way cube
geometry works is that you provided a
size and x y&amp;amp;z it then creates a set of
triangles for you forming a box with
these dimensions once you have this
geometric object you can use it as many
times as you wish to create three j/s
meshes each of which consists of
geometry and a material you can use the
position parameter on the mesh class to
reposition the box and in fact you'll
need to do this for the exercise when
you create a box it is centered around
the origin for a vertical part of the
step we want this piece to be resting on
the ground to do so we take half of the
height of the piece and move at this
distance upward so that the bottom is
now at ground level the horizontal piece
making up the flat part of the step is
created with this code in this case we
first pushed the step up half its
thickness so it rests on the plane then
push it up the rest of the height of the
vertical piece so that it rests on top
the Z position is also changed pushing
the planks so that one edge is at the
origin and then it pulls back a bit so
that it rests firmly on the vertical
piece that's shown here got all that
once you run the program you'll see the
two step pieces with the vertical piece
resting on the ground plane you'll also
notice a cool program feature there are
some controls available the grids can
help you get a sense of distance along
each axis they have lines every hundred
units each is labeled with the axes that
are in that grid plane for example since
the y-axis is up for the scene the XZ
grid is on the ground plane your goal is
to build a number of steps one on top of
the other going forward that just
reaches the gold cup here's what things
will look like when you're done don't
build any more steps than are necessary
or will charge you for extra time and
materials plus you won't pass the
problem I recommend that you first play
around with the position
parameter and see its effect on the
model setting the position to zero shows
what the block looks like centered at
the origin you should also consider
using a loop as it's a lot easier in the
long run than brute force being a smart
programmer can save you a lot of grunt
work using programs to generate
geometries such as a number of stairs is
called procedural modeling personally
I'm pretty bad at using modelers so I
like modeling this way it's great that
with a few lines of code you can
generate pretty complex models here's
procedural model called sphere flake
that I made more than 25 years ago
around the same time Pixar created a
short film called Red's dream primarily
using procedural modeling since there
simply weren't great modeling tools
easily available back then see the
additional course materials to download
the program for this model and others
along with pointers to many other
related resources but don't get
distracted right now go ahead and build
the steps</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
