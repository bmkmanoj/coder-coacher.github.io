like to discuss regarding indices it's
for using them for sorting so far we've
been talking about you know using basic
a hash table to create an index but one
of the characteristics of a hash table
is that it's not sorted you know a hash
table is it's just a mapping of keys to
values and if you remember how they're
implemented they're implemented as as a
big you know array with all these fields
and inside these fields are these keys
that are basically the hashed version of
some value if you add a new element into
your hash table you know the new element
can go into any one of these cells it
could be the case that this key was
added last you know it just happens that
that key hashed to you know this
position zero in the hash table so we
lose our sorting information when we use
a hash table and we saw some you know
some sequel queries before that use the
order by statement obviously that
requires some sort of sorting so there's
a different type of mapping we can use
and this is called a tree trees are a
basic data structure that accomplished
something similar to a hash table but
they have the nice property that they
are sorted why would you ever use a hash
table when you can use a tree instead
well the downside is that the lookups
are slower hash tables lookups are
faster so I don't think you've talked
about these algorithms yet in 101 but
basically a hash table has constant time
lookup which means that generally
looking up any particular key in our
hash table is not a function of the
number of keys in the hash table they're
inserting can be a little hazardous
remember if there's collisions I think
you talked about that in 101 but in
general the lookups are going to be
constant time and in a tree the lookups
are going to be roughly a function of
log n where n is the number of elements
in a tree so lookup speed decreases with
the size of the tree and depending on
what you're going to use our index for
you may choose to use a hash table or a
tree many databases let you choose some
actually don't or some choose for you an
interesting property of indices used by
most relational databases is that they
preserve sorting and there's some cool
things we can do with that you know one
is that if you want to find every you
know if you want to
find all the links in your database
sorted by votes if you created an index
on boats that'd be a very very fast
query you know you just go to the front
of your trie your index on boats and
just read off the links and I'd like to
show you how we use that at reddit to
make the hata algorithm work</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
