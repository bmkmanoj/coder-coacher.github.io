regular expression didn't do the job it
was too permissive but that doesn't mean
that there isn't a smarter super tricky
regular expression that would capture
balanced parentheses however it just so
happens that there isn't it turns out
that it's impossible to capture balanced
parentheses with a regular expression a
formal proof may be presented in the
supplemental material but for now I'm
just going to give the intuition here's
what we want an open parenthesis
followed by a closed parentheses each
repeated the same number of times in
this intuition or this notation is meant
to remind you of mathematics x squared
is just x times X so open parentheses
raised to the power of 2 would just be
to open parentheses next to each other
in a string so what we really want is
open parentheses to the power of n close
parentheses to the power of n but this
has to be the same n in order for the
parentheses to be balanced unfortunately
all we can write with regular
expressions is open parentheses star
close parentheses star and in regular
expressions these two stars need not be
the same in fact if you think about the
finite state machine interpretation of
regular expressions remember when we
were simulating finite state machines
the only thing we really had to remember
was where we currently were and what the
input was we didn't really remember
where we'd come from and in order to
match up the same number of opens and
closes we'd have to remember where we
came from regular expressions just don't
have that kind of memory so with regular
expressions i can say zero or more open
parentheses followed by zero or more
closed parentheses but those two numbers
don't have to be the same so regular
expressions can't always remember two
different numbers and force them to be
equal this notion of balanced
parentheses is worth paying a lot of
attention to because balanced
parentheses are everywhere in HTML and
JavaScript these tags for beginning bold
and beginning italics ending italics and
ending bold have to be perfectly nested
for valid HTML
it's as if the beginning bold be where
some sort of parenthesis in the ending
bold were closed parenthesis and then
the italic tags maybe were angle
brackets or some other type of
parenthesis that really had to match up
these have to be perfectly nested and
they have to open and close each other
in tandem open the bold open the italics
close the italics to close the bold you
can see the same sort of thing in a
Python or Java Script assignment these
two parentheses match up so do these two
and they're perfectly nested here we see
an example of malformed HTML the tags
the parentheses of HTML don't match up
properly let's see what happens when I
try to draw that same sort of diagram oh
there's no way to connect these two eyes
without crossing the lines and crashing
over each other this tells us that the
parentheses do not match we could also
look at it like this if we view it as a
mathematical formula the normal
parentheses and the square parentheses
don't open and close in the right
ordering in order for something to be
valid HTML tag openings and tag closings
must be perfectly nested this is not
valid HTML and for our web browser to
work correctly we're going to need to
tell the difference</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
