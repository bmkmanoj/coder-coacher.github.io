expression now this might look really
complicated but it's not too tough to
get there first we distribute the cube
root of 4 X Y to each of the terms and
our second parentheses when we multiply
these two cube roots together we'll get
64 X cubed Y cubed so we know this
distribution gives us this first term
now we want to distribute this to the
second term for the second term will
have the cube root of 12 and then X Y
from these variables here next we
distribute the cube root of 2 to this
term so we'll have the cube root of 32 x
squared Y squared and finally for our
last term will have cube root of 2 times
the cube root of 3 which equals the cube
root of 6 next we try to simplify any of
the radicals that we can the cube root
of 64 equals 4 and the cube root of x
cubed Y cubed is XY this radical is
already simplified since there's no
factor that repeats three times
underneath the radical so we leave it as
is we can't simplify the x squared Y
squared since we don't have a group of
three but we can simplify 32 here since
32 is the same thing as 8 times for the
cube root of 8 equals 2 and this leads
us to our answer on the end here the
cube root of 6 can't be simplified so we
have to tack it onto the end there's no
like terms here since none of the
radicands are equal so we're done this
is our final answer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
