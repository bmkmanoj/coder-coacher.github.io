latency that users perceive as well as
the loss rate here we've shown power
boost
latency effects for two different users
the latency is shown in terms of
round-trip time in milliseconds and the
loss rates are shown on the right side
of the y-axis Layton sees are also shown
in a log scale in this particular
experiment we start sending traffic here
and we stop sending traffic here in both
cases we can see that even though power
boost allows users to send at a higher
traffic rate actually users may
experience high latency and loss over
the duration that they're sending at a
higher rate the reason for this is that
the access link may not be able to
support the higher rate so if a sender
can only send at our sustained for an
extended period of time but is allowed
to burst at a rate R for some shorter
period of time then buffers may fill up
and the resulting buffers may introduce
additional delays in the network since
packets are being buffered up rather
than dropped TCP senders can continue to
send at higher rates such as little R
without seeing any packet loss even
though the access link may not be able
to send at that higher rate as a result
packets buffer up and users see higher
latency over the course of the
power-boost interval to solve this
problem you might imagine instead that a
sender might shape its rate never to
exceed the sustained rate big R if it
did this then it could avoid seeing
these latency effects so certain senders
who are more interested in keeping
latency under control than they are in
sending at bursty volumes may wish to
run a traffic shaper in front of a power
boost enabled link so shaping traffic to
a rate of less than this sustained rate
R can prevent this buffering more
details about
boost and the experiments that we've run
to keep latency under control in its
presence are available in a paper we
wrote called broadband internet
