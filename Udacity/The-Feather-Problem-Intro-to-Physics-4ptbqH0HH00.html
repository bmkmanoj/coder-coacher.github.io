about the feather problem remember back
in unit 2 that Aristotle said objects
fall at a constant speed and he said
that speed was proportional to their
mass Galilei on the other hand so that
all objects fall with constant
acceleration we seem of taking Galileo
side in this debate but is that the
right thing to do after all a feather or
sheet of paper seems to fall down at
what seems to be a constant rate let's
consider something called air resistance
now if you ever driving in a car on a
highway and you stick your hand out the
window you don't need to have a
ridiculously long arm but it helps you
can feel this force of air resistance
and this is the force of a quickly
moving object for example your hand
feeling the actual individual molecules
of air as they slam up against your hand
and that provides an actual force and
it's always opposite the direction of
motion so if the car is going this way
the forces that way the size of this air
resistance force is more or less
approximated by an equation like this
here V is the speed you're traveling it
and B is some number that depends on
maybe the size and shape of your hand or
the feather as you can see this force
goes bigger as your velocity increases
so let's say you have this feather and
it's being pulled down by gravity as it
speed increases the air resistance force
it feels will also increase what
eventually happens is the feather
reaches what's called terminal velocity
and that is the maximum speed that the
feather reaches so let's save a feather
with mass 0.001 kilograms so that would
be 1 gram and this be this constant
appear of 0.04 I'm not going to tell you
the units but I bet you can tell me what
they are on the form I want you to tell
me knowing what you know about motion at
a constant speed what will be the
feathers terminal velocity in meters per
second</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
