want to be able to draw is to say that
if you change one thing another thing is
likely to change also for example you
saw that students who passed the first
project are more likely to visit the
classroom multiple times in their first
week this is a correlation passing the
first project is correlated with
visiting the classroom multiple times
does this mean that visiting the
classroom multiple times in the first
week causes students to pass their
project this would be a statement of
causation for example suppose you'd
acida sent emails to students during
their first week reminding them to come
back and this caused more students to
visit multiple times would you expect
this to increase the number of students
who complete their project it certainly
sounds plausible but we can't be sure
based on this data to see why let's take
a look at this graph which shows per
capita cheese consumption in red and
number of people who died by becoming
tangled in their bed sheets in black as
you can see these two variables are
highly correlated as what increases the
other tends to increase as well however
do you think eating cheese causes people
to become tangled in their bed sheets
probably not this could be a coincidence
or there could be some third factor
causing both in this case it looks like
both cheese consumption and veggie
tangling are increasing over time if
this is the case then if you banned
cheese bed sheet tangling would probably
continue to increase over time so what
are some third factors that could be
causing the correlation between visiting
the classroom and passing projects one
that I thought of is level of interest
maybe people who don't find the data
analysis course is very interesting
don't visit the site many times and then
they also don't pass the project because
they're not interested in working on it
if you somehow convinced these students
to visit the site more their lack of
interest might still prevent them from
working on the project a better approach
might be for the student to try learning
something else that they find more
interesting another factor might be
background knowledge maybe some people
don't have the programming knowledge
they need to take the data analysis
courses and they get stuck and don't
come back if you convince these students
to come back and keep trying they might
remain stuck and not be able to make
forward progress in this case a better
solution might be taking a programming
course to fill in the missing back
knowledge on the other hand this
correlation could be because of
causation and I actually find that
explanation pretty plausible but the
point is that we don't know based on the
data we have to find out whether one
change causes another you need to run an
experiment and online experiments are
frequently called a B tests to learn
more about how to set these experiments
up and some common gotchas that can
arise check out Udacity scores on a be
