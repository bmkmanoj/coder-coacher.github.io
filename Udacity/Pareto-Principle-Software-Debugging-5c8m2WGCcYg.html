distributions for several systems at
Microsoft at Google at sa P and on many
open-source programs what we always
found was the so-called Pareto principle
that is 20% of all modules contain 80
percent of the bugs the numbers vary
from project to project but what we
always found was there was a relatively
small number of modules that would
contain lots and lots of issues
initially we were just excited of being
able to create such distributions more
or less at the touch of a button but as
you look at these distributions you
begin to wonder where do these bugs
actually come from do these modules that
actually are specifically bug prone have
something in common and if they do have
something in common
could we use this very feature to make
predictions so we dug a bit deeper and
checked a number of interesting features
the first question we ask does the bug
density correlate with the experience of
the developers that wrote the programs
that is possibly more experienced
developers make fewer mistakes so for
these questions I'm going to ask you for
a guess on your side these will not be
rated so what do you think does bug
density correlate with developer
experience yes or no</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
