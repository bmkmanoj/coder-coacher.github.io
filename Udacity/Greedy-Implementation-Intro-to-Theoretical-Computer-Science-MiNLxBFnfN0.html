approximation algorithm for vertex cover
and let's review that very quickly so if
we were to implement this algorithm in a
function called greedy VC the first
thing we would do is create a loop that
checks that not all edges are already
covered then in that loop we're going to
first choose a vertex that has the most
uncovered edges and then we're going to
put that vertex into the cover now
notice that you might choose a different
vertex with this depending on how you
traverse the graph if you have multiple
vertices that all have an equal number
but the maximum of uncovered edges in
the graph so your order with this might
vary so I'd like you to implement this
entire algorithm in the function greedy
VC where you get an adjacency matrix as
the input now as output I would like you
to return first the size of the vertex
cover and then a list containing all the
vertices that are in the cover and again
we're not going to worry about order
here because you might get a different
order than what we get and we'll check
for that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
