now a chain network you can think of as
being the relationship between a set of
individuals with a direct chain so
basically for example the relationship
between me and my chain of ancestor so
might be you know this might be my son
is connected to me and I'm connected to
my dad my dad's connected to my
grandfather so on I actually don't know
who my great-grandfather was that's a
chain Network in a ring network we
actually now complete the loop which
isn't a good representation of my family
I'm glad to say but lots of other things
do have this sort of relationship and as
we can see in this particular example we
have a ring of five nodes and there are
five edges one two three four five one
thing that might be useful to do at this
point is to look at what ring network
like this might look like as a piece of
code for the purposes of this course I'm
going to represent graphs as
dictionaries of dictionaries the way
that that works is let's take a look
here so what we're gonna do is make a
graph we're gonna call it a ring we set
N equal to 5 and we initialize the ring
to be an empty dictionary so just brace
brace and what we're gonna do is to this
empty graph we're gonna start adding in
edges and the particular edges we're
gonna add in we're gonna loop for each
number from 0 to n minus 1 we're gonna
make a link in the ring from node I to
node I plus 1 mod n that's going to give
us the wraparound at the very end what
make link does and I'm gonna use the
same definition throughout is it takes a
dictionary or graph and two nodes that
we want to connect together checks
whether the first node is already in the
graph and if it is not then it creates
an empty dictionary for that node same
thing for node two then it goes to the
dictionary for node 1 in the graph and
says that there is a connection to node
2 so this basically just establishes the
connection between node 1 and node 2 so
that later we can go and test for it if
we want to
so once we've created that dictionary we
can ask questions like well how many
nodes are in the graph and how many
edges are in the graph so I actually ran
this already you can see that the number
of nodes is indeed 5 which is good we
wanted it to be and the number of edges
the way that we're calculating that is
by taking a look at all the
nodes in the graph in this case the
Yankee's print paren is giving us back a
list of all of the names of the nodes in
the graph and we're gonna sign the
variable node to be each one of those in
turn and what we're gonna do with that
node is look up the dictionary for that
node in other words look up all the
connections that that node has in the
graph look up the length of that put it
together in a big list this list has one
entry for each node in the graph and
that entry is exactly how many edges
that node has which you may recall from
last time is called the degree of the
node but this expression actually from
this bracket here to this bracket here
gives us a list of the degrees of all
the nodes we sum all those up and now
we've counted each edge twice so we
divide by two to get the total number of
edges in the graph in this case I'd then
printed out the actual graph itself just
so you can see what it looks like
so five is the number of nodes five also
happens to be the number of edges
because this is a ring there's one edge
coming out of each node and then
wrapping back round to the front and
what it actually looks like internally
is the list of the nodes this could be
any name at all as long as each node has
a unique name I used numbers here
because it was really easy to do so
there's no 0 node 1 node 2 node 3 node 4
and what node 0 is is a dictionary of
all the nodes that it is connected to
directly so node 0 in a 5 node ring is
connected to node 1 that node right -
it's right and node 4 there no that
would be one behind it with the
wraparound similarly one is connected to
0 and 2 2 is connected to 1 and 3 and so
on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
