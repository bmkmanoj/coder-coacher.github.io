Android testing honestly we could
probably should make an entire course on
how to do it well let's just look into
how to run tests and when to use unit
tests versus connected tests we have to
find a super simple project with this
class echo it has a method that just
returns whatever you put into it it also
has another version of echo where it
first logs whatever you input and then
returns it we've also added a product
flavour to this project and you paid
folder we've got paid echo which does
essentially the same thing but for
collections instead of single objects so
we have this collection echo that just
echoes back whatever you put in and then
this version of echo that first logs
each item that you put in so we have
defined some tests in the test directory
these are J unit tests and so we just
verify that echo is in fact behaving how
we expect and that the logging version
of echo is behaving how we expect to
test it the paid flavor in the test paid
folder we have another pair of extremely
simple J unit tests that just verify
that the echo of the collection works as
expected and that the echoing of the
collection with logging works as
expected all of this code is in the
course repository so you can get a
closer look there if we open up the
Gradle pane and run the check task let's
see what happens when we run these tests
uh-oh
we have failing tests we can check out
the report at this file path to see what
went wrong so here we are at app build
reports tests free debug index.html and
here's our report of what went wrong
see method I in Android util log not
mocked so I think I know what's going
wrong here we tried to use the Android
logger from a unit test now the android
framework doesn't exist when we're
running unit tests since those are being
run on the local machine if we want to
test something that is accessing the
android framework we have to run those
on the device let's move those into
connected tests instead of unit tests so
we'll comment out the tests that require
the android framework comment this one
out too
and now we'll add are connected to tests
to the Android test directory note that
this is an Android test case now instead
of a J unit test and we can add our paid
tests to the Android test paid directory
now if we open up the Gradle pane and
run connected check then there we go the
tests that require accessing the android
framework will run on the device where
the android framework is available and
they all pass</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
