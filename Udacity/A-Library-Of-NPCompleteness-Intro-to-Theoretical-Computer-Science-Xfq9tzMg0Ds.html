problem always so involved with playing
around with strange constructions such
as you know weird networks well the
answer is in a way yes
showing np-completeness can often
involve playing around a lot and some
gory details in the proofs so even today
there are still scientific papers being
published that basically just show the
NP completeness of a certain problem or
a set of problems so it's not an easy
task
but luckily there's a whole arsenal of
known np-complete problems out there
which I'm now going to show you if you
go on Wikipedia for example there's a
whole list of np-complete problems from
graph theory Network design sets and
partitions and so on and so on so for
most practical problems that you'll
encounter either they have already been
shown to be NP complete or that will
likely be very similar to one or more of
these problems for which we already know
that they are np-complete in this case
similarity is a good thing because
similarity means that your reductions
will in most cases be either much easier
than what we have just seen with
shortest tour or at least if you then
look at the NP completeness proofs for
those problems they might give you
techniques and ideas for performing the
reduction that you're looking for the
foundation for this library was laid by
a computer scientists called Richard
Karp
who in 1972 showed 21 different problems
to be np-complete and that was basically
the starting point for this huge list of
thousands of np-complete problems now
let's see if you already have an
intuition which np-complete problems
would be most useful to show the NP
completeness of other problems so let's
say you encounter a number of problems
one problem we'll deal with clustering
or finding large groups of related
objects or you would encounter a problem
that deals with covering a set of
objects as efficiently as possible so
you have to select a few objects that in
some way observe or you know covering is
a good term other objects in the set or
you could encounter a problem that and
some way deals with optimizing pathways
so getting from one point to another
point but there are a few constraints of
here that you have to meet so here's
I hear you're trying to find closed
groups of related objects finally you
could deal with a problem that is about
diversification so large groups of
independent objects don't have anything
to do with each other and finally
something else now you already know 5
and P complete problems you know
shortest tour you know vertex cover you
know sad independent set and clique now
what I would like to know from you is if
you encounter a problem that basically
arises in one of these five situations
here which of these problems here for
which we know that there are np-complete
would be your best bet for proving a
problem that falls into one of these
categories here is np-complete so
basically using this as a basis for a
reduction so these are numbered and you
can enter your numbers for the ones that
you think match best in these circles
