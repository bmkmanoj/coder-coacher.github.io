build a lot of this interpreter together
I will get started you'll complete the
rest we're going to write an evaluate
expression procedure to interpret
JavaScript arithmetic we're only going
to handle plus minus and numbers for now
our procedure walks over a tree so it
takes a single tree as argument note
that this is a little different from our
HTML interpreter which took multiple
trees remember that our trees typically
look like these it's either a tuple
number followed by something like five
or maybe something like been up for
binary operator with a left child tree
or right child tree and something like
plus in the middle this first part here
is the node type we're going to extract
it by getting the zeroth element of the
tree if it's a number all I have to do
is figure out the integer value of this
string Python allows me to do that just
by calling int as if it were a function
to turn this string into an integer
otherwise for us the node might be some
binary operator so we'll just pull out
the left child the operator and the
right child from the parts of the tuple
that you already put there for us when
you did all the hard work of making the
parser so here's what I want you to do
for the quiz you'll need to figure out
the value of the left and the right
child and the big hint here is recursive
function call and then once you have
those values you should actually do the
work if this is a plus binary operator
add them together</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
