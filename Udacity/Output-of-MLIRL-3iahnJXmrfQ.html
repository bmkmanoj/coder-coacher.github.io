example that we just talked about is
something that I drew up on the screen I
decided I would actually turn that into
a real example and ran it in burlap with
the implementation of ML IRL that's
there and this is this is the result
it's actually kind of neat so here's the
trajectory and the and the MDP that we
ran in and here's how ml IRL decided to
actually assign rewards to the different
colors so you can see that the cell
that's green is assigned very high
positive reward so it is you know
drawing the agent over to that that is a
positive place to be and you can see
that the blue squares are actually
fairly negative the ones that correspond
to these blue puddles are given a if not
insignificant negative reward so they
are actually avoided on purpose one of
the things that's interesting is as we
talked about there's no set of evidence
in this trajectory that red is good or
bad and in fact it ends up getting
pretty much the same reward as the
background basically zero one thing
that's a little bit more interesting is
that it actually concluded that the
these aren't this orange strip is
somewhat aversive it gave it a slightly
stronger negative reward to try to get
it to avoid it and I guess that was
because the demonstrated path didn't
have the agent spending multiple steps
there and it could have yeah but it
didn't so maybe it was a bad place right
so there's lots of ways that it could
have got they could have come all the
way over to the orange and gone straight
down yep but since it didn't it must it
maybe tried to pick a path that
minimized orange right and so it just
kind of went with that and gave it a
slightly negative reward if we gave it a
bunch more examples and we could see
negative well whether whether the orange
really was consistently a good thing or
a bad thing
the it would get fixed with more
training data but it's a pretty it's
pretty neat how much it can pull out of
actually one single example that
actually uh that's actually kind of cool
and and I do like that it gets slightly
negative it doesn't believe that you're
trying to avoid orange just that maybe
you are because if you weren't trying to
avoid it avoid orange I guess if I
thought about all the paths that could
get me from where I started to where I
ended up there's a lot of them that
involve touching orange more than once
and since you didn't pick that one maybe
you're trying to avoid touching orange
more than once and since they're all the
same thing that would be evidence that
it's something to avoid although it's on
very slight evidence so that turns it in
slightly negative that's kind of cool
that's gonna amazing yeah I think so too
I mean and and one of the things that I
really like about this is the notion
that it's actually learning not just
from the positive example of where it
went but in a sense from all the
different paths that it didn't take
right right and so the fact that it
didn't hit blew it it used that as data
so it actually is combining this notion
of you know your planning in the full
MDP with well we get to see one
trajectory through that so what is that
telling us about other parts of the MVP
so I guess the short version of this is
you can communicate a lot even by
communicating a little and an even
shorter version of that is less is more
well no I wouldn't say that at all but
you just did I did but I but then I read
it and I realized that that's not what
you meant or that's not what I wanted
you to mean so so yes that you can
communicate a lot with a little less is
enough maybe I like that that's like hey
doesn't know and eight is less than nine
so less is enough I like that and and
that pretty much sums up the the three
C's that I wanted to talk about</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
