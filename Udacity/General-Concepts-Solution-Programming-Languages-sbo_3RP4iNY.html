instructor for this course on
programming languages building a web
browser you may have seen me on the
forums and kind of managing the course
in general but one of the major things I
do helping you learn this material is
going over the homework answers with
that said let's get started with the
first problem on the first homework
assignment and that is a multiple choice
question on general concepts covered in
the first lecture statement one says
what pages can control their behavior
and appearance through embedded
JavaScript this is definitely true
almost any web page that you use on a
daily basis has tons of JavaScript that
make things nice and interactive and
speedy if you were to visit say our
website without JavaScript enabled
there'd be almost nothing you can do
nothing would load nothing would be
interactive and it's really not an
overstatement that javascript is the
basis for modern web applications
statement 2 while English sentences can
be broken up into words HTML and
JavaScript cannot this statement is
false let's look at a piece of HTML to
show you why here we can break up this
sample bit of HTML into smaller pieces
namely the beginning of the bull tag the
actual text that says ervin and the
ending of the bolt tag individually each
of these things has meaning in the same
way that the sentence above the word and
allows HTML and JavaScript to together
be applied to the cannot some of these
words have semantic meaning others are
more syntactic structure but nonetheless
their words just in a different language
statement 3 for every Python program
that calls re final there's another
Python program that does not call
re-type find all but still obtains the
same results as it turns out the
statement is true before I deal with
re-defined all let's think of an
alternative example and build up to that
let's say instead of wanting as you find
all we just want to find one that is
given a regular expression
input.text we want to determine whether
or not the text matches exactly the
regular expression and we can do this
using the tools that we developed in
lecture particularly the procedure fsm
sim what we have to do is create a
finite state machine representation for
this regular expression and that's
pretty straightforward we process the
input text on this state machine using
FS MSM so you'd have to represent the
state machine using the map that we
described in lecture and if the input
text ends on an accepting state then we
can say we found one match so that's how
we use fsm sim to find matches for the
regular expression but find all does
something a little different let's say
you had this code this statement takes
into regular expression the map numbers
and an input string that contains two
numbers 12 and 30 for what fine dollars
going to return looks like this it's
going to return to strings 12 and 34 so
we can use fsm sim to do kind of one
matching if we were just given the
string 12 then we could do that but we
want to do a little different style of
interpretation with find all and we can
still use fsm sim just with a little
more effort so let's say we have our
black box at the sim sim and it has the
representation for that regular
expression we also have our string that
consists of five characters what we're
going to do is we're going to feed in
the first character into our regular
expression simulator one matches the
right of expression so so far we have a
match for one in order to match larger
strings we're going to try adding one
more character and we're going to feed
in 12 to our regular expression
simulator 12 matches so far so good now
we're going to try 12 plus 12 plus
doesn't match so we've realized that 12
is the largest possible prefix that will
match this regular expression and it's
going to be wanted results so we're
going to go back and we're just going to
try plus plus doesn't work we're going
to try plus 3 that doesn't work either
that's on the number and + 34 which also
doesn't work so we're going to give up
on the plus and we're going to do the 33
matches
now we can try for 34 matches and since
that's all the characters left in the
string we're done and that's kind of how
we can use fsm sim to simulate the same
exact functionality of fine ball
statement for every regular expression
that involves neither plus nor star
matches a finite set of strings this is
true in the regular expressions that we
define in class the only repetition is
through plus and star we can do some
fancy things still such as or or
optional characters but that doesn't
even get us near the possibilities that
these repeating operators can give us I
can enumerate a lot of different types
of my regular expression a lot of
different strings but it's never going
to be infinite and so if you don't have
the plus or the star you're stuck with a
finite set of strengths you may be a
very large finite set but it's still
finite</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
