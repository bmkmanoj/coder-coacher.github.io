practice with combining like terms I
want to make sure that it's abundantly
clear which terms were allowed to
combine and which ones were not terms
that you're trying to add together can
be combined if and only if two things
are true so first things first the terms
have to have exactly the same variable
or variables so examples of this would
be terms like three XY + 7 x y or
negative 4b and 15b on top of this I
have to add that each of these variables
that correspond to one another have to
have the same powers or the same
exponents so if we had the term 3x
squared and the term 6x and we try to
add those together we cannot combine
them these are not like terms because
even though they both have X's in them
this is 3x squared and this is just 6 X
to the first power they don't have the
same power so we can't squish them down
into one term another example of this
would be something like 11 a b cubed
plus 12 a squared b cubed even though
the b cubed factors have the same power
that a here only has a power of 1 and
the a here has a power of 2 we cannot
add these two things together because
one of the variables involved does not
have the same power in both terms so we
cannot squish them down into one term</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
