inequality this one uses the word or I
want any number of X sec makes this
inequality true or any number of X that
makes this inequality true it doesn't
have to be true for both of them I'm
going to do some legwork and go ahead
and solve these inequalities now would
be a good point to pause the video and
see if you get the same solutions idea
for the first inequality we get x is
less than or equal to 1 for the second
inequality we divide by negative 3 so we
reverse the inequality sign and we get X
is greater than or equal to 3 any number
less than or equal to 1 or any number
greater than equal to 3 will satisfy one
of these inequalities let's see this on
a number line so here's our number line
any value to the left of one will work
for this inequality and any value to the
right of 3 will satisfy this inequality
just like all the other equations and
inequalities we've done we can check our
answer to make sure we're right I'm
going to check 0 for this inequality and
I'm going to check for for this
inequality remember zero won't work for
this one but it will work for this one
we just need to make sure it works for
one or the other if i plug in 0 for X
for the first inequality i get negative
4 is less than or equal to 0 this is
true if i plug in x equals 4 into the
second inequality i get negative 12 is
less than or equal to 9 this is also
true this is great these solutions work
for the first Center quality and these
solutions work for the second they don't
need to work for both they just need to
work for one or the other</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
