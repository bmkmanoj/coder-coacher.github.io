tell how far away objects are our eyes
well at least my eyes are not laser
scanners they don't return CDF's
directly to my brain maybe another way
to say it is that we're not bats and
don't use sonar our eyes detect what is
called the radiance coming from each
direction our brain figures out
distances from a variety of visual cues
we're not even particularly aware of
these cues for example it wasn't until
the Renaissance that painters figured
out that distant mountains had a blue
tinge and so started to paint them that
way however the actual amount of light
from those distant mountains is a given
amount of radiance we don't store a
depth one way to think about radiance is
in terms of a function called the light
field the idea of the light field is
that for any point in the universe and
for all directions from that point there
is an incoming radiance value that we
can record say we're sitting at a desk
for our location we can look around and
see a color in any direction in computer
graphics terms we're recording a
radiance for each different specific
direction we look to form an image we
find the radiance coming through each
pixel imagine we have a sensor floating
in space that can move anywhere and look
in any direction I like to think of the
sensor mounted on a turret with the
turret rotating as needed the question
to you is how many numbers how many
variables do we need to specify our
imaginary sensors location and direction
so that we can record the light
traveling through any point in the
universe from any direction</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
