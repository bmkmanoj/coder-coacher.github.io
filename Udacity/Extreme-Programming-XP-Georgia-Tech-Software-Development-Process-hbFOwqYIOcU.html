method which is also one of the first
ones extreme programming also called XP
and to introduce XP I'm going to start
with the quote the quote says XP is a
lightweight methodology for small to
medium-sized teams developing software
in the face of vague or rapidly changing
requirements and this is a quote from
Ken Beck the American software engineer
that created extreme programming and by
the way Beck was one of the original 17
developers who signed the agile
manifesto in 2001 and as you can see
we're still talking about the
methodology so we're not just talking
about going out and start writing
software there are principles and there
are practices that we need to follow but
we're going to do it in a much more
agile in a much more flexible ways than
we did for our software processes and
also note that the vague and rapidly
changing requirements are explicitly
mentioned because this is really one of
the important parts about all of these
agile methodologies so what is XP XP is
a lightweight humanistic discipline of
software development
it is lightweight because it doesn't
overburden the developers with an
invasive process so process is kept to a
minimum its humanistic because as we
said it's centered on people people
developers customers are at the center
of the process it's a discipline as we
said it includes practices that we need
to follow and finally it's of course
about software development software
development is a key point of the whole
method in XP developing is like driving
imagine having a road a windy road we
need to be able to drive our car down
this road take the wrong turns react
promptly to changes for example
obstacles on the road so in a nutshell
change is the only constant eyes always
have to be on the road and it's about
steering and not pointing and XP is
trying to do the same thing while
creating software systems in XP we need
to adopt a mentality of sufficiency what
does that mean
how would you program if you had all the
time in the world no time constraints at
all you'll probably write tests instead
of skipping them because there's no more
resources you would probably restructure
your code often because you see
opportunities to improve it and you will
take them you probably talked with
fellow programmers and with the customer
often interact with them and that's
exactly the kind of mentality that XP is
trying to promote and agile processes in
general and we will see that following
some of the practices that XP is
advocating you can actually achieve
these goals and you can actually behave
in this way and the development process
is
going to benefit from it overall</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
