the onclicklistener
as we're starting to realize Android is
very specific about the details around
how to listen for an input event the
method can't be named anything else it
needs to be precisely on click and have
exactly one input which is the view
being clicked on and have no return
value so you can think of this outline
here of the onclick listener regarding
the class and the methods as a contract
that you as a developer need to follow
in order to be notified of a click
events in more formal java terms this is
the definition of an interface at the
top of this documentation page in small
font it says interface in the future
it's highly likely that you may come
across another component Android that is
also an interface so at this point you
may be wondering wait a minute
how is an interface different from a
class the document pages look pretty
similar well in the last course we
learned about classes like textview
which contains state and methods that
are fully implemented meaning there are
instructions in each method now we're
being introduced to interfaces which
contain no state but it does contain
method signatures remember that a method
signature signifies the return value
method name and input parameters it ends
with a semicolon and there are no curly
braces with the code in the middle for
implementation of the method this means
it's an abstract method in abstract
methods implementation is intentionally
left blank so that a developer like you
who wants to use an interface can
provide their own specific instructions
for it so it's like saying fill in the
blank for what you want to happen when
this view is clicked on there can be
multiple abstract methods in an
interface but this example of the
onclicklistener interface only has one
abstract method the onclick method in
the future will also encounter abstract
classes this is a partially implemented
class and it contains state and some
methods are fully implemented while
other methods are left abstract for
someone else to define the behavior so
you can think of this as a continuum
where an interface is not implemented at
all an abstract class is partially
implemented in a concrete class is fully
implemented so how come an
onclicklistener is not a concrete class
and why is it a textview an interface
and this
with the view group being an abstract
class the Android team made these
respective decisions based on what would
make it easier for developers like you
to build an app every developer will
need to display text on the screen so
they created a concrete text view class
that accomplishes that we can simply
call methods to change the text in the
view so in this abstract class case we
want to standardize some behavior about
view groups being a container of
multiple child views however the details
of how to layout the views on the screen
is left undefined for the subclass to
determine in this case linear layout and
relative layout are subclasses of the
view group class they each define their
own rules for how views should be laid
out on the screen on the other hand the
Android team knows that many developers
will probably want to customize the
click behavior it wouldn't make sense to
provide default behavior for what
happens when a button is clicked but the
Android team did want to standardize
what the method call would be and the
cost type would be an onclicklistener
then they leave the logic inside the
method for the developer to write
themselves so to summarize if you come
across a concrete class in Android you
can use it right away if you come across
an abstract class you need to subclass
this and then provide your own code for
the abstract methods if you come across
an interface you need to provide for all
the abstract methods</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
