depends on the protocol that it's using
to forward packets and the lookup
mechanism might be implemented with a
variety of different algorithms or
techniques for example MPLS Ethernet and
ATM use an exact match lookup exact
matches can be implemented as a direct
lookup an Associated lookup hashing or
via a binary tree ipv4 and ipv6 on the
other hand are implemented with what's
called longest prefix match we've
already looked at longest prefix match a
little bit in some lessons and in this
lesson we'll look at it in a bit more
detail as well as how it's implemented
it might be implemented as a radix try a
compress try which is something that we
will look at in this lesson and it can
also be implemented as a binary search
on prefix intervals Ethernet based
forwarding is based on exact match of a
layer 2 address which is usually 48 bits
long the address is global not just
local to the link and the range or size
of the address is not negotiable now 2
to the 48 is far bigger than 2 to the
12th therefore it's not possible to hold
all the addresses in the table and use
direct lookup the advantages of exact
matches and Ethernet switches is that
exact match is simple and the expected
lookup time is small or o of 1 but the
disadvantages include inefficient use of
memory this potentially results in
non-deterministic lookup time if a
lookup might require multiple memory
accesses let's now take a closer look at
longest prefix match</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
