information would be stored most
efficiently in the overlapping model in
reality the triplet code is read in a
non-overlapping fashion actually the
less efficient method so obviously if we
were designing a system this doesn't
make a lot of sense as far as efficiency
sake right we can get more information
stored in this overlapping model then
compared to this non-overlapping model
where each codon has to be its own
individual or its own discrete unit and
it turns out that this messiness this
inefficiency is a result of evolution
and in particularly some molecular
constraints of the system that are
slightly beyond the scope of our
material here so this means that we're
left with 64 possible combinations of
three nucleotides and each set of three
is referred to as a codon so we have 64
possible codons and a codon is just a
sequence of the three nucleotides which
are part of the genetic code and it took
years of experiments to finally
determine exactly which codons code for
which amino acids and this information
is referred to as the genetic code
although it took many years and a lot of
hard work to come up with this
information I'm giving it to you right
here summarized for free and less than a
few seconds here is all of the magic of
the genetic code you're gonna have to
get quite familiar with this table so I
hope it doesn't scare you away too fast
I've color-coded it to try to make it a
little simpler for you and I'll explain
to you how to read it in just a moment
but the first thing I want you to do is
actually just stare at it for a minute
try to read it first letter in the codon
second letter in the codon third letter
in the codon we have you see a G you see
a G and then each combination for every
row here and then you can see each codon
is spelled out in the individual box and
then beside it is the amino acid that it
codes for what patterns or features
stand out to you about this genetic code
is there anything interesting that you
notice I want you to use the text box
here to describe any kind of response
you have the money
to this question and don't worry about
getting this right or wrong I just want
to see what you pick up on you could
always go to the forum and see what
other people think about the genetic
code too</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
