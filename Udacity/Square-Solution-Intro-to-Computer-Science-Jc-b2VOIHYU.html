a procedure so we used the death
followed by the name will cult use the
name square followed by the left friend
and now we need to decide what the
parameters are and remember when we
define procedures we should always be
thinking about what the inputs are and
what the outputs are in this case the
input is one number we see in our
example was the number five we can give
that any name we want and is usually a
good name for a number so we'll use n
and then we have the colon and now we're
ready to define the body of square what
we want sware to compute is the square
of the number so we want to multiply and
by N and that's the output so we can do
everything with one statement it's going
to be a return statement where the
expression that we're returning is n
times n we want to get the value of n
squared and that's what we return so
here's how that looks in the interpreter
we're defining Square our body returns n
times n and we're gonna print the result
of square five we get 25 we can use a
variable let's say X has the value of 37
we can print the result of square X we
get a bigger number that's 37 times 37
and we could also do this let's say we
assigned Y the result of square X and
then let's print the result of squaring
Y so that will give us 37 squared and
then we're gonna square it again that
gets quite a large number 1.8 million or
so we could do those compositions
without variables so we could do this
directly we could print the square of
the square of X so we're calling Square
twice here the first time we're passing
in 37 then we're getting the output of
that and then we're passing it in to
square again this is called procedure
composition this is the way most
programs are written that we're gonna
write little procedures each procedure
is going to take some inputs and produce
some output but then we're going to use
the outputs that we get the first time
we use a procedure as the inputs to the
next procedure in this case we only have
one procedure to find so I've used
square twice when we run this we see the
value of 37 squared which is quite a big
number we'll see lots more examples of
how we can compose procedures using the
outputs of one procedure as the inputs
to the next procedure to get lots more
interesting things done and you'll write
some procedures that do that yourself
pretty soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
