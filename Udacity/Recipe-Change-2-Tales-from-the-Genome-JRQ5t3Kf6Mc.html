that the main difference between the
daughters in the mother's recipe is a
change in temperature from 375 degrees
Fahrenheit to 75 degrees Fahrenheit
that's a huge difference in temperature
and is most likely going to result in a
very flat cake of any cake at all when
you bake it for 20 minutes so i would
have selected the change between the
mother and the daughters recipe and i
would have said well because that's a
bigger change in the overall effect on
the cake right it's not going to rise if
you don't cook it at a high enough
temperature of course some people may
think that the icing is a really
important component in a cake and that
matters the most the point is is this
decision is slightly subjective here's
actually a word cloud of student
responses from you and your fellow
classmates in the class on which recipe
change you thought was most significant
now I think that most of you probably
see that the change in temperature is a
slightly more significant change than
they change in icing but some of your
classmates may in fact think that the
icing color change is in fact
significant in and of itself the point
is the changes occurred but the degree
to which someone thinks they're
significant can be a subjective decision</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
