researcher at mozilla research who also
sits on the standards committee for the
governing body for javascript i was
wondering if you might tell us a bit
about changes to the language over time
or what's coming down the pike sure um
so JavaScript was initially invented by
Brendan Eich in a great rush he famously
invented the first version of JavaScript
in 10 days and the original goal of
JavaScript was to create a little
scripting language where people could do
little things with web pages and I think
there were people even back then who had
some visions of where it could go but it
really did start from pretty humble
beginnings and at this point javascript
really is the language of the web and
the web has become not just a place for
documents but a place for serious
programs for serious applications so as
a result the platform grows the language
grows and the needs of the program the
programmer grow with it so while
javascript started out as a simple
language the needs of programmers aren't
as simple as that used to be so that
means that there's a lot of features
that other programming languages have
and javascript does not have that we've
had to consider standardizing on so a
big one is that as your program start to
get bigger you have needs around
organization of your programs that don't
actually arise when your programmers
when your programs are smaller so you
may have seen as you're working with
python that python has a module system
it has the ability to define separate
pieces of code that you put into modules
and then you can mix and match those
modules and put together larger programs
from smaller components javascript
doesn't have a module system at all so
it's actually not that easy to create a
library create a piece of reusable code
that you can share with other people
there are various it amuse within the
language to sort of simulate a module
system but they don't get any support
from the language directly so one of the
biggest features that we've been working
on for the next version of javascript is
a module system in some ways similar to
pythons module system although
javascript has some particular needs of
its own the web has some particular
if its own but that make it much easier
for people to create reusable individual
chunks of code that they can share with
each other</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
