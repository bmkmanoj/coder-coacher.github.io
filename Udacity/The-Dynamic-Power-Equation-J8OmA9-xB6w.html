system has roughly speaking two parts
the first is constant power which is
what you pay just to keep the system on
the other part is dynamic power that's
what you pay above and beyond constant
power while the program is running let's
take a quick look at some of the basic
circuits 101 drivers that underlie
dynamic power imagine a simple logic
gate taken out of a larger circuit this
gate has a certain amount of physical
energy it is both right and natural to
represent that energy by analogy to a
snifter of mighty fine atlanta-based
beverage quick extra credit if you can
name this brewery now suppose a gate
input changes then the energy dissipates
and also quite naturally has to be
refilled put differently when the
circuit switches there will be some
energy loss this energy loss then has to
be restored let's first ask how much
energy that is and then ask how
frequently this switching happens let's
see how to compute dynamic power start
with the amount of energy consumed by
this gate during a state change in
electrical engineering terms C is the
gates capacitance capacitance is a
function of the material properties and
geometry of the gate V is the supply
voltage supply voltage as part of a
circuit design it can for some circuits
be tuned over some range more
importantly is how V enters into the
equation it enters as the square now for
our class it's not too important to
understand exactly where this
relationship comes from but do remember
that the product CV squared quantifies
energy so how often does switching
happen well there are two factors the
first is the frequency or clock rate of
the circuit it has units of cycles per
unit time the clock rate determines the
maximum number of times that the circuit
can switch or change states per unit
time now the gate doesn't necessarily
switch on every cycle depending on what
the computation is doing the switches
might happen only once every few cycles
that brings us to the second factor
which is the activity factor it's the
number of switches per cycle if you
think about how a clock works it has a
maximum value of 1 in general it will
depend on what the computation is doing
take
together these parameters tell us how to
compute dynamic power it's basically the
energy per gate or CV squared times the
switching frequency which is a times F
this formula is sometimes called the
dynamic power equation before moving on
let me give you one more quick fact
about it the clock rate F and the supply
voltage V usually need to be kept in
proportion to one another that is
suppose you cut F in half then you also
need to cut V in half increases are the
same suppose you increase F by two then
you also need to double V so why do F
and V need to change together the short
story is that it has to do with
maintaining the stability and
reliability of the circuit in particular
its reliability in the presence of
environmental noise okay now is a good
time to pause and see if you can
understand what this formula implies can
be done if you want to increase
performance while reducing power</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
