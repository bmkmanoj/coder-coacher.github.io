the teacher delivered the smaller shocks
on the shock generator
whenever the learner made an error
however as the shocks increase in
intensity many of the teachers became
very uncomfortable and unsure about
continuing when the teachers expressed
to Milgram that they didn't want to
continue Milgram would tell the teacher
that the experiment must continue you
must continue with the experiment so
every time the teacher tried to ask
Milgram to stop he told them that they
were unable to do so and they needed to
continue delivering the shocks while the
teacher was administering the shocks he
heard some pre-programmed responses from
the learner
for example in 90 bolts the learner
would yell ugh
and it's at these times when the teacher
became uncomfortable and would tell
Milgram I want to stop and recall
Milgram would say you must continue the
experiment must go on at 150 volts the
teacher would hear the learner yell get
me out of here my heart's starting to
bother me I refused to go on let me out
here again the teacher will become
uncomfortable and tell Milgram that he
wanted to stop in each instance Milgram
reminded the person that he had to
continue with the experiment and that he
could not leave finally when the volts
went past 330 the teacher would hear no
response from the learner at all and
this supply that the learner was either
unconscious or worse remember when
Milgram asked those experts how many
people would go up to 450 volts well
they were very wrong in fact in his
results he found that 65% of the
participants went all the way to 450
volts also there were no differences in
the sexes meaning men and women were
equally likely to go all the way up to
450 volts interestingly adding the
yelling of the learner at 150 volts
where he yelled let me out of here I
don't want to continue did decrease
obedience from 100 percent down to 83
percent it's important to point out that
the participants were debriefed
and told after the study what the study
was actually about and they were
reunited the teacher in the learner and
the teacher could see that the learner
was actually never harmed Miller have
conducted a series of studies in this
area and changed some of the variables
for example he changed the attire of the
researcher it turns out that people were
more likely to obey when the researcher
was wearing a white lab coat then when
the researcher was more casually dressed
like here and one experiment he changed
the proximity of the teacher in the
learner and removed the barrier so they
could see each other in these situations
the teacher was much less likely to go
all the way to 450 volts these are
called systematic replications of the
original research study so it turns out
there are many variables that influenced
obedience to Authority now let's go to
Greg to talk a little bit more in depth
about the ethics of this Milgram
experiment</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
