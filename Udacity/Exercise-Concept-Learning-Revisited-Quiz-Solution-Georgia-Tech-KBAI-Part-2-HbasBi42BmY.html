also why you choose the answers that you
did so I said that these five were all
birds each of them have wings each of
them have feathers and I know that each
of them lay eggs the other three are
kind of interesting this is a sugar
glider and it flies and we often think
of flying as a bird behavior but it does
imply the same way birds do and it
doesn't have the other features that
birds have it has fur instead of
feathers and doesn't actually have wings
and we also know it doesn't lay eggs a
bad is even more interesting if that
does have wings but it doesn't have
feathers the way birds do and that's
actually give birth to live young the
platypus shown here is an interesting
case because it actually lays eggs it
has a bill like a bird does and it also
has flippers the way a duck does but
it's still not a bird because it doesn't
have feathers so I would say that these
five are all our Birds some of the
things that we often attribute to birds
like flying the Bluebird an eagle and a
duck do penguins ostriches don't
actually do but they're still birds
because they meet our other criteria for
birds that was a good answer David thank
you note that David was able to classify
these eight animals into birds which one
of these animals belong to the class of
birds and which one did not belong to it
notice also that he used some criteria
to decide on that he has some notion it
seems or what is a typical bird what
kind of features is a typical bird have
he has some notion of what are the basic
conditions that some thing must satisfy
in order to be considered a bird and if
those conditions are not being satisfied
he would reject them and say those are
not words</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
