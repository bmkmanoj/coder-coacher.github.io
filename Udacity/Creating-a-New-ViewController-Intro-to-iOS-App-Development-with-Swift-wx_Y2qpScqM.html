is add a button right here that place
some audio
let me drag out the utility area and
then go find the button and then drag
that onto the canvas here now I'm going
to change the image of this button in a
little bit but before I do that I want
to think about where I'm going to write
the code that will execute when I press
this button
in essence where do I write the action
for this button using the control drag
technique let's think about how we did
that for the stop button in the previous
scene I'm going to select the scene and
then go to the assistant editor so you
may recall that we control drag from
this stop button to this file
viewcontroller.swift and created an
action called stop audio so what we need
to do now is create a new view
controller for this second scene in our
app alright to do that
I will first manage some screen space by
going back to the standard editor then I
will go to the file menu at the top
click on new and then create a new file
here under iOS on the Left I will select
a cocoa touch class and then click Next
I will call this class play sounds view
controller now this is going to be a
subclass of uiviewcontroller because we
want to inherit methods like viewdidload
etc our language is still swift and I
will hit next and I will save this new
class in the same folder as my app and
hit create alright so we now have a new
file called play sounds
viewcontroller.swift
with a class by the same name inside it
so the next thing to do here is to go
back to the storyboard and connect this
second scene in our app here to the new
file that we just made so I will select
the second scene and then open the
utilities tray in here under identity
inspector you will notice that the
current view controller is this guy UI
view controller I can substitute this
with play sounds view controller and as
I start typing Xcode autocompletes it
for me all right so let's make the
action for this button now I can go to
the assistant editor and on the left
here I see my storyboard
and on the right I see the
viewcontroller that this scene is
associated with which is the new file we
created play sounds view controller dot
Swift if I go to my first scene you will
notice that the view controller on the
right hand side of the screen changes
which is view controller dot swift so I
can hop back and forth between my first
scene and the second scene in the app
and the view controller for it changes
automatically the reason why that
happens is because we have this
automatic setting selected over here
alright now we can create an action for
this button in this new view controller</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
