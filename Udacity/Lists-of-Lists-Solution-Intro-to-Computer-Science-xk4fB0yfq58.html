structure that is a list of universities
where each entry is another list that
contains the name of the University the
number of students that attend that
University in the tuition costs what we
want to calculate are the total number
of students enrolled at all the
universities in this list and the amount
of money that all of them are paying
what we're going to do is some the
number of students so we're going to
keep a track of all the students and
keep adding for each University this
second value on the list and then we're
also going to keep a second counter that
is the amount of tuition that they're
paying and so what we're going to do for
each entry we want to multiply these two
values and add those so we're going to
have 50 times two which is one hundred
and hundred times one which is also 100
so the end result would be the tuition
is 200 and the number of students enroll
is 150 so this is what will return both
those values let's write the function
that does that so I've declared the
function it takes in a list and I've
started my two sums the number of
students enrolled in the total tuition
all of the students are paying so I've
had a little trick here to make the code
a little shorter this is a Python thing
that you probably didn't know but feel
free to use it in the future what I'm
saying is that for each value in the
list I have the name which is going to
correspond to the first entry in the sub
list the students correspond to the
second entry in the syllabus and price
correspond this third entry in the sub
list if I had the other version where I
just had say for I MP and then assign
the variables names that's all we're
doing here is it just a little shortcut
to save you this time of writing the
three lines to write this out so here
for each school I update the number of
students by simply adding the number of
students to the total count and I update
the total tuition by simply adding the
amount of the students are paying at
this particular University to the total
tuition and in the end I return both
values which you can do by simply adding
the comma</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
