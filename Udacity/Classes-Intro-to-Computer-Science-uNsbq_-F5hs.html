talking about classes which are the way
we make our own types in Python the
syntax to define a new type in python is
to use class followed by the class name
this is the name you make up such as web
corpus and I'll explain what this means
in the next unit for all of the classes
in this unit will just use object and
inside the class there's the block this
is like the block inside a function
except inside the class the block is
mostly going to contain definitions and
they're going to be definitions of
functions we'll talk more about why that
is and what we're using them for so
instead of using the search engine
example introduced classes I'll leave
that for you to do in the homework we're
going to choose classes using another
example inspired by one of our students
Andrew who built a company perfect menu
you can read more about that in the
Udacity ball gets quite an inspiring
story and we're going to think about
what we would need to do to represent
restaurants and menus and things like
that if we were going to build a site
similar to what Andrew built so let's
assume we want to build a site to store
restaurant menus that means we probably
need some way to represent restaurants
so we want to make our own type so we'll
do that by making a class will call it
restaurant and we'll make the base class
object we're going to talk more about
what that means later but for now that's
going to be something we put in all of
our class definitions and for the body
of the class we do need something we'll
just have a doc string and a dog string
is just a string that comes right after
a definition in this case right after
the class it should provide some useful
documentation so people understand what
the object is you'll notice that I used
an uppercase letter for the name of the
type this is just a convention and if
you have a long class name with multiple
words you want to use what's known as
camel case and this is a mini hump camel
I don't know that they have camels with
that many homes they're probably a
little unstable but the idea is to make
it so you can see the separate words
using uppercase letters this is just a
convention in other contexts in Python
we would use underscores to separate
them but for class names we use
uppercase and lowercase letters this is
all we needed to define a new type we're
defining a type named restaurant and we
can put that in a separate file will put
it in a file called restaurant pie is
not necessary to put classes in their
own modules but if it's an important
class which a restaurant probably would
be for this application
it's a good idea to do so</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
