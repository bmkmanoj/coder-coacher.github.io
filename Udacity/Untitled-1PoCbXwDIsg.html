complete and get working it's a little
quiz app that reads the phrase to you in
a random language and displays three
choices one of these is the correct one
you can make a choice or hear another
phrase yep lets you know if what you
choose is correct or not we built this
app with two purposes first we think you
can be a fun little app to show to your
family and friends here in your hands
after a few minutes on the Udacity iOS
developer nanodegree you have an app
that can speak in multiple languages the
second purpose is in my mind the most
important one with this app you can get
a glimpse of the power of iOS we did not
use pre-recorded audio iOS is speaking
in these different languages on the fly
let me stress that point again iOS is
able to speak any text that you have in
a variety of languages with just a few
lines of code okay let's get you started
in the structure notes you will find the
starter project grab this project and
open it in Xcode I'll guide you from
there we'll cover Xcode in depth in the
next lesson but if you want an overview
now feel free to go through our exco
tutorial in beginning iOS by following
