our regression looks like when it's
overfitting so you know exactly why it's
so bad
suppose that this is my input data my
best fit line might look something like
this but let's suppose that because of
the the model that I'm using in the
features that I'm using I have the
possibility also of doing a regression
that's a little bit nonlinear so for
example I could fit it with something
maybe it looks like that where there's a
little bit of curvature to the line and
having a curved line is probably not
necessary in this case you saw that the
straight line fit it perfectly well but
now it's something that the computer
sort of has available to it as a
possible solution once the curvature is
allowed and if I let it get too complex
by using too many features I can
actually get something that looks like
this so you could imagine how a computer
that's trying to find a function that
minimizes the sum of the squared errors
on the training set might actually
really prefer a function that looks like
this because it gets very close to all
of the training points however you could
imagine that if I took another sample
from sort of the same population so I
just collect some more data points that
are consistent with the ones that I've
already collected and you can imagine
that this wiggly line is actually going
to do a worse job of predicting the
trend in these red data points then my
original straight line does so this
wiggly line is going to be a classic
case of where I've used too many
features it's a very high variance
solution and it's not going to
generalize well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
