threat is implausible and an end in a
very kind of real sense so what's
happened is if you do fink out on me if
you do cross that line the idea that I
will then spend the rest of my days
punishing you for going reward myself
right not taking a best response against
you seems kind of crazy do you agree
yeah again my ex-girlfriends yeah I
totally get this no but no I'm saying
that nobody would do that right so it
would be like being in an elevator with
a stick of dynamite and seeing that
someone has a hundred dollars and saying
give me your hundred dollars or I'll
blow us both up that's not really
reasonable threat because the
alternative to me not giving you a
hundred dollars is you die it seems
probably not worth it that's right so
you can think about the possibility of
ok I'm going to not give you the hundred
dollars you say that you're going to
blow me up but you will hurt yourself
more than you hurt me so it won't be a
best response not blowing me up and just
not getting the hundred dollars and
leaving the elevator is better for you
than blowing me up right so that is an
implausible threat so the way that we
formalize this idea in the game
theoretic contact is to say that we're
interested a plausible thread
corresponds to something that's called a
sub game perfect equilibrium ok so sub
game perfect means that each player is
always taking a best response
independent of the history alright so
let's actually look at a concrete
example here let's imagine playing grim
trigger against tit for tat so my first
question to you is are these two
strategies in nash equilibria with each
other yeah i guess so and why is that
because the fact if i'm playing tit or
if one player is playing tit for tat
then the grim trigger thing doesn't
matter anyway because both you're going
to cooperate forever and it doesn't make
any sense to DDA right so any strategy
that i could choose that's different
than grim trigger is going to on average
do no better possibly worse right so I
might as well stick with crib trigger
and tit for tat has the same kind of
feeling about it that it's cooperating
with grim and any it can't really do
anything better so it might as well do
that right so the next question to ask
is are these two strategies in a sub
game perfect equilibrium with each other
and the way that you actually
a test that as you say well they are not
sub game perfect if there's some history
of actions that we could feed to these
machines so that so that you know here's
here's what Grimm is doing its it's some
some sequence of cooperates and defects
and here's what tit for tat is doing
it's some sequence of cooperates and
defects and once we've reached some some
particular point is it the case that one
or the other these machines is not
taking a best response that it could
actually change its behavior away from
the what the machine says and do better
than what the machine says if that's the
case then it's not sub game perfect but
if it's the case for all histories
they're always taking your best response
then it is sub game perfect so do you
see as a sequence of moves that these
two players can take where one or the
other of them is not going to be doing a
best response it's a can take right as
opposed to will take I don't understand
yeah I'm not sure I do either which is
why ask a question um it's not a you
know a made-up history it's like an
actual set of moves that are consistent
with grim and tit for tat no no no no so
it is it is not necessarily so we know
that if we actually pay these against
each other the only history that we're
going to see is cooperative remember
right Grimm is going to do cooperate
cooperate cooperate cooperate tit for
tat is going to do cooperate cooperate
cooperate cooperate and so they are and
everything's fine the question is can we
actually go in and alter the history so
that one or the other and the machines
could take a better action than the one
that the Machine tells it to take yeah
tit for tat ever does a defect all right
so let's take a look at that so let's
say on the first move grim cooperates
and tit for tat defects okay so let's
say that that's the moment in time what
will the machines do at this point well
at this point then the next time step
tit for tat will cooperate and Grimm
will defect good and then thereafter
Grimm will always defect and then to
Pratap will always defect right so the
payoff that grim gets at this point is
going to be well initially high but then
very very low on the other hand could
grim have changed its behavior to do
better than this
yeah just by doing a just by choosing to
cooperate by choosing to cooperate so it
sort of ignore the fact that that tit
for tat did the defect and instead to a
cooperate here then Grimm would do
better so the idea is that Grimm is
making a threat but when it comes time
to actually follow through on that
threat it's actually doing something
that it's worse for itself then what it
would do otherwise you see that I do so
is it sub game perfect no and the proof
of that is exactly what you said take
take a look at this history here's a
history where Grimm would not be willing
to actually follow through on its threat
right so it's an implausible threat and
that's bad so maybe we've now just
undone all the awesomeness that we had
done no well maybe I mean the
awesomeness was hey look we can actually
get machines that are in Nash
equilibrium and their cooperative in
prisoner's dilemma so they're actually
kind of doing the right thing and it
turns out well they are but they're
depending on this notion of implausible
threats to do it hmm how should I feel
about that well let's see if we can fix
it okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
