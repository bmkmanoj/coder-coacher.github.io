that can help us problem-solve even more
quickly than using Pythagorean theorem
if you were able to solve the last
problem without using the Pythagorean
theorem then great work if you didn't I
would go back and check that solution
see how we can do it for the last
problem we could actually use the
special ratio three to four to five to
find a missing side length if the side
lengths are in the ratio of three to
four to five then any multiple of that
would also be a right triangle so if I
multiply each of these by two I could
also have a six eight ten right triangle
we know this is a right triangle since 6
squared is 36 8 squared is 64 and 10
squared is 100 a squared plus B squared
equals C squared so multiplying through
by any number for this ratio would give
us a right triangle we can multiply
through by three to get a different
right triangle and in fact that triangle
would be a 9 12 15 right triangle so by
knowing a special right triangle we can
generate an infinite amount of larger
right triangles that's why this ratio is
so important in fact it's called a
Pythagorean triple there are a couple
Pythagorean triples that appear often
enough that it's helpful to know these
if you're able to quickly recognize
these then you can easily find missing
side lengths for example if we had this
right triangle that had a leg of 35 and
I had potenuse of 125 units what would
be this missing leg now you could use
the Pythagorean theorem to solve for
this missing leg but I really want you
to think about this in terms of ratios
which of these ratios can help you find
this missing leg choose the one that you
think it corresponds to and then fill in
the missing number based on a multiplier
good luck</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
