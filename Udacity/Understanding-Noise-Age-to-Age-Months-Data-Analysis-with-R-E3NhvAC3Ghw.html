summarize the relationship between age
and mean friend count recall that we
ended up creating this plot from the new
data frame that we created using the D
ply our package the plot looked like
this as you can see the black line has a
lot of random noise to it that is the
mean friend count rises and falls over
each age let's print out some of our
data frame to have a closer look as we
can see the mean friend count increases
then decreases later in one particular
case we can see that for 30 year olds
the mean friend count is actually lower
compared to the 29 year olds and the 31
year olds
now some year-to-year discontinuities
might make sense such as the spike at
age 69 but others are likely just to be
noise around the true smoother
relationship between age and friend
count that is they reflect that we just
have a sample from the data generating
process and so the estimated mean friend
count for each age is the true mean plus
some noise we can imagine that the noise
for this plot would be worse if we chose
finer bins for age for example we could
estimate conditional means for each age
measured in months instead of years over
the next few programming exercises
you're going to do just that you're
going to create a plot just like this
one with a new variable that measures
ages and months instead of years then
you'll plot the conditional mean for
ages and months and we'll compare this
graph to the one that you create to
start you're going to create the age
with months variable and save it into
the data frame this variable will have
each user's age measured in months
rather than in years so if a user is 36
years old and was born in March the
users age would be 36 0.75 try coding
this up in R for yourself and then once
you have the code copy and paste it into
the browser and submit now this is one
of the exercises that where the grader
will automatically check your output
don't worry if you don't get this one
right on your first try it's pretty
tough
I really recommend thinking about ages
and people being bored in different
months how would that affect the
variable age with months working with
actual values might help you here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
