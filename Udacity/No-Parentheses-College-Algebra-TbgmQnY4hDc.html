first things first before we showed that
if we had negative 3 the entire quantity
taken to the fourth power that was equal
to positive 81 the difference between
that question and this question here is
the lack of parentheses in this problem
this time we need to think about order
of operations I'm not going to do a
super in-depth review of this here but
we're going to give you plenty of review
problems to practice it and we'll also
keep touching on it at different points
throughout the course since it's pretty
fundamental to doing algebra or really
any other kind of math you may have
heard some sort of mnemonic device or
acronym earlier to help you remember the
order that we do different mathematical
operations when we're evaluating
expressions so I for example learned
pemdas now H these letters stands for a
different mathematical operator the P
here is for parentheses the e here
stands for exponents the M stands for
multiplication the d stands for division
the a is for addition and last but not
least the S is for subtraction so this
can serve as a guideline to tell us what
order we do all these different
operations in when we're looking at some
set of numbers and variables combined
together with these operators so in the
last question mated for example since
the p for parentheses comes before the e
for exponents we knew that the negative
sign need to be applied to the three
since it was inside the parentheses
before before we took that number to an
exponent there are no parentheses
written out here so we really have we
have a negative sign in front of a
number remember is negative one times
that number so negative 3 is actually
equal to negative 1 times 3 and we take
this 3 to the fourth power the four is
only attached to this 3 now because
there are no parentheses that surround
the negative sign as well since pemdas
tells us that we evaluate exponents
before we multiply we first need to
figure out what 3 to the 4th equals
before we can multiply that by negative
1 so we know that 3 to the fourth is
equal to 3 times itself four times so
now you just multiply all this out and
we get negative 81 so you can see that
negative 3 to the fourth power gives us
a completely different answer then the
whole quantity negative 3 taken to the
fourth power parentheses make a huge
difference when we're using exponents
and also
please don't forget to take advantage of
the review exercises we give you we want
to make sure that things like order of
operations that you've probably seen in
previous courses feel completely
comfortable for you so if you're having
trouble at all with this or just want to
make sure that you totally understand it
do a bunch of our practice problems this
is going to help establish a really
strong foundation for you as we move
forward in this course</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
