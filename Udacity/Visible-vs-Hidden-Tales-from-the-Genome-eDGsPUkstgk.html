taste is in fact determined genetically
a lot of times because it has to do with
your taste but receptors but not all
traits can easily be distinguished as
visible or hidden that's true and
sometimes it can be really hard to tell
let's take an D here for example I and E
you see these beautiful big blue eyes so
the presence of these big blue eyes are
obviously a visible train but there's
something about Andi that you may not
suspect and we can't see on the outside
if we had an x-ray machine and when
you've looked inside the midsection of
his body we would be able to see that
his organs are actually flipped the
opposite direction for most people this
is a syndrome called situs inversus
where all of the organs are flipped
left-right to be the opposite symmetry
now you'd never know this about Andi
because this is a trait that's not
easily visible by the unaided eye so why
don't you actually think about two
traits you have one that's visible and
one that's hidden and enter them in the
text boxes here and if you can try to
limit your responses to one word</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
