outputs in particular the outputs
produced by the concrete operations
along with any changes made to class
attributes and other side effects must
satisfy the abstract specification among
other things this says that the answers
that your implementation give had better
satisfy what is required by the
specification stated in logic if we have
some concrete state t and the invariant
is true and the preconditions are the
concrete preconditions are true and the
after executing the operation the
concrete post conditions are true then
it better be the case that the abstract
post conditions are true parsing this
one step by step like we did for the
inputs valid concrete States as the part
that says for all T element of the set
of concrete state's capital T the
invariant the concrete invariant must
hold on that state and the concrete
preconditions are satisfied and that's
the pre accuse of I on T and whatever
arguments we have and running the
concrete operation satisfies the
concrete post conditions that's the
phrase with post Qi on the concrete
state the arguments the resulting
concrete state t ' and whatever results
are produced then the post condition had
better mapped to the stated abstract
post condition the last part of our
first order logic which says the post
condition on the abstract operation p I
with the retrieve state the arguments
the retrieved version of the resultant
state and the results produced had
better hold note that as you might
expect the implement the implementation
can do more than what the spec says at
long as it does at least what the spec
says</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
