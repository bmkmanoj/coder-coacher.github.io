Google's incompleteness theorem but
since they are often mentioned in
conjunction with the halting problem and
undecidability it's worth saying a few
words about them Goodin's incompleteness
theorems named after the Austrian born
mathematician code goodl are concerned
with mathematics but are actually
closely related to undecidability and as
you might know any mathematical system
starts out with a set of axioms
what are axioms axioms of statements
which you assume to be true without
having any formal proof for them such as
if a equals B and B equals C then a must
also equal C or you can always draw a
line from one point to another point no
matter where they are those would be
axioms now axioms often sound very
trivial like this one here or the fact
that you can always draw a line between
two points but for many of them there
are actually scenarios but they are not
true so axioms are the basis of any
mathematical theorem or proof now what
could good and showed and it was a
shocker at his time and too many it is
still today is the following
so what could Google showed was that if
you have a set of axioms and they don't
contradict each other and they are
listed which means you could have an
algorithm that lists you all of these
axioms so either they are finite or they
can even be infinite as long as you have
an algorithm that can produce them all
if this is the case then there are some
statements that are true but which you
cannot prove based on these axioms and
this is what he meant by incompleteness
how he basically showed that no matter
what foundation you base a mathematical
system on as long as that is a
consistent foundation then you cannot
prove everything without adding
additional axioms at least and he also
showed and this is the second
incompleteness theorem which is
basically an extension of the first one
that a system of axioms cannot
demonstrate its own consistency and what
that means is that very informally a
mathematical system cannot be used to
show that it itself is consistent when
these two statements are in a way very
similar to the halting problem and
undecidability the axioms you could
think of those as programming statements
so any program or algorithm is composed
of a number of
simple instructions that are then
arranged and of course there's an
infinite number of possible computer
programs that you can write but they are
made up of a finite set of building
blocks and the second incompleteness
theorem is of course very similar to
undecidability in the sense that it
shows that you cannot use a system to
prove everything about that system very
loosely speaking and the undecidability
of the halting problem and all the other
undecidable problems of course says that
we cannot use algorithms to calculate
everything about algorithms I know that
from a practical perspective there's
lots of criticism of this but truth be
told I just find that super fascinating</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
