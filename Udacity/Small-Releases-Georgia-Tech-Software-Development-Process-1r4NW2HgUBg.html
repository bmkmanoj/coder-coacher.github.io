together with the small religious
practice this idea that instead of
having a big release at the end of a
long development cycle we try to release
very often and there are many advantages
to small releases and to release in
often the first one is that we deliver
real business value on a very short
cycle and what that means is that we get
business value sooner and that in turns
increase our customer confidence and
makes the customer more happy small
releases also mean rapid feedback we
release the software soon we get
feedback from the customer soon and we
can in this way do exactly what we were
saying before steer instead of driving
adapt quickly to possible changes in the
requirements we avoid working for six
months on a project and find out six
months later that the customer wanted
something else and we got their own
requirements in addition having small
releases so senior product deployed and
released soon produces a sense of
accomplishment for the developers and in
addition it also reduces risks because
again if we're going down the wrong path
we will know right away if we are late
we will know right away so these are
just additional advantages of having
this quick cycle and small releases and
finally as we also said before we can
quickly adapt in the case our
requirements change our code to the new
requirements</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
