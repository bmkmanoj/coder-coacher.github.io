both of these will need to go through
the loop here the number of elements in
index times in the case where it's a
word that's not in the index the test
will always be false and we'll get to
end a loop and return none in the case
where the last word is added will still
go through the loop the number of
elements times but the very last time
we'll find a match and return that
element one of the assumptions in all
this analysis is that the time it takes
to go through the loop doesn't depend on
the actual keyword that's passed in and
that's assuming that this equal
comparison takes the same amount of time
depending on what the entry and the key
word is that it doesn't matter what the
key word is the time to do this
comparison is the same and it turns out
that for Strings in Python that's the
case that we can do these string
comparisons very quickly because strings
are immutable that means that we don't
need to look at all the characters in
the string to compare two strings that
double equal four strings can be done in
such a way that it doesn't need to look
at the whole string it knows that the
strings were created as different
strings that means they're different
strings or if they were created as the
same string they're the same string so
that's the reason why we say that all of
the other operations in the loop have
constant time that they don't depend on
the size of the inputs at all these are
all very fast operations what matters in
terms of understanding the time is the
number of times we go through that index
if you take the following course which I
hope you will will understand how to
analyze algorithms in a more formal way
for now our goal is to develop an
intuition and for that intuition the
important thing to understand is the
running time depends on the number of
times we go through this loop everything
that we do inside the loop is constant
time it's not affected by the size of
the inputs</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
