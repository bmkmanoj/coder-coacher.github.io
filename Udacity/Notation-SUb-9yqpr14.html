to give you some tools to think
carefully about dealing with complexity
that is the management of these levels
of abstraction so to do that I'm going
to introduce some notation this notation
is taken from from first-order logic to
state property to precisely we're going
to need a little of that notation and
throughout the rest of this lesson we're
also going to use the term abstract and
concrete to refer to the upper and lower
levels of a refinement first off we're
going to talk about the abstract
operations and we're going to use P 1 P
2 and so on up to P n and p I will use
to indicate a typical up abstract
operation we're going to have abstract
States the set of abstract States is the
capital letter S and a typical abstract
typical element of the abstract state is
the letter S and we'll also put an
apostrophe after the S if what we're
talking about is the abstract state
after an operation we have invariance we
use inv to indicate invariance and I NVA
will stand for abstract and variance and
I MVC will correspond to the concrete
invariance we have preconditions and
postconditions and we'll just append the
word pre and post to our P is to
indicate whether it's a precondition or
a post condition and those pre and post
conditions can have states associated
with them and arguments finally we'll
use symbols like the ampersand to
indicate and and the right word facing
arrow to indicate implies</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
