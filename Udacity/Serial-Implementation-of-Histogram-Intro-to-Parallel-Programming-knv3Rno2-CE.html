histogram itself to look forward in this
week's assignment you'll compute the
histogram of pixel intensity values in
an image histograms are not a difficult
problem if you think about them serially
but they get more interesting in
parallel so let's first take a look at
the cereal histogram algorithm so here's
our code here we're gonna have two for
loops where we loop over all the
histogram bins so the first phase we
initialize all the bins to zero the
counts for each of the bins to zero this
is so simple we're not going to mention
it again much more interesting is the
second phase we're going to loop through
all the data measurements for each data
measurement we first determine to which
bin it belongs
that's the compute bin call and I'll
show an example in a second then we
fetch the current value of that bin
anchor minute and store the new value
back into the men for instance in the
previous example let's say the input to
compute bin is 175 centimeters so we
take a measurement it's 175 centimeters
compute bin then decides which of these
bins is associated with 175 centimeters
in this case compute bin would return
this bin because it stores all the
measurements between 165 and 180 so we
take 175 its then associated with this
bin and now we increment the value of
this bin so now let's consider these
four bins and we're gonna trace a
program with the four measurements 155
150 175 and 170 centimeters so the first
loop here will initialize each of these
bins to 0 items and then we'll walk
through these four measurements using
compute then to decide which bin they're
in and incrementing the values in those
bins so first we'll consider 155 compute
bin will tell us it's in this bin right
here so we'll increment its value to 1
then we look at 150 compute bin will
tell us its value is in this bin again
and we'll increment its value to 2 next
we'll consider 175 which is associated
with this bin and now we've incremented
its value and finally 170 will allow us
to store 2 so a couple of quick
questions to make sure you understand
the histogram let's say we have n
measurements and B bins as a function of
N and B what is the maximum number of
measurements we would possibly ever see
per
and what is the average number of
measurements you would see per bed</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
