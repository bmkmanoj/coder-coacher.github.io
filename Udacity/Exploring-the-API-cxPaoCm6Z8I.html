we saw earlier that we could set the
location of the panorama by calling set
position on the street view panorama
object and give it latitude and
longitude in addition to that we can
also get the location and this will
return a street view panorama location
object this object itself will have a
latitude and longitude on it so you can
use this if the user has moved around
the map to understand where the user is
presently and then you can plot that
location on a map so for example if the
user was hiking down the Grand Canyon
you could have a map beside the street
view panorama view and as the user moves
down the Grand Canyon as the user moves
along and Street View you could ever pin
on the map update to show the users
location based on what they're looking
at you can also get panoramas camera on
a street view panorama now you might
remember the camera from earlier in this
course and the concepts are the same
this will return a street view panorama
camera as you saw when we were creating
the app and this will allow you to read
or edit things such as the zoom the tilt
the bearing etc let's take a look at the
code now and look at the panorama camera
again and see how we had set it up so if
you remember back to the code I've
changed the camera view to be one where
at Point South by setting the bearing to
be 180
I created a street view panorama camera
and I tell the panorama to animate to
that camera at this bearing I could have
done similar things with tilt or zoom
just like I would do with a mapping
application so if you're not familiar
with this check back to the sections
where we explored using the camera on a
map view earlier in this course</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
