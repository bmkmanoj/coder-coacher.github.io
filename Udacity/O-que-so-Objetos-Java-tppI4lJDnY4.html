these boxes did you remember them oh
yeah yeah I do remember them
they're variables where you can put the
value inside yeah and you can combine
multiple of these variables to create a
larger Java object okay so you can take
two or more variables and make unto a
something bigger exactly okay like a
textview yeah so we can have an integer
variable this is for the font size
exactly okay and then you can also have
a string variable and the string
variable for the actual text itself yeah
and those can go inside the textview as
the state of the textview and then we
can interact with those things using
different methods that we're going to
play with next exactly okay let's do it
as we mentioned earlier showing a
textview on the screen like this is
actually controlled by a java object
within the app this is an example of a
textview Java object it's like a box and
inside of it it holds state the state is
made up of a bunch of fields a field is
a variable like in lesson two when we
learned about global variables we can
have a text field to store the today
string which is going to be the text
that's ultimately displayed on the
screen we can also have an integer field
to store the font size of this text
there's also a bunch of other fields
like text color font family that make up
the state of the textview I just didn't
draw them in this picture to interact
with this Java object and change it
while the app is running we can call
methods on the textview we learned about
methods earlier in lesson 3 some example
methods on a textview are set text and
get text you can also have methods like
set text size or get text size and so on
each of these methods just executes a
list of instructions you can have more
complex methods like ondraw which
handles drawing the textview onto the
screen so overall this textview object
holds state information on what this
textview contains and you can call
methods to interact with this textview
such as to modify the state or to do
more complex actions to show an image
view on the screen we actually have a
Java object for image view inside of the
app this particular image view contains
state information like which image
should
as well as the scale type like Center
crop again there's a bunch of other
fields that make up the state of an
image view I just didn't draw them here
there's methods like set image set scale
type and even more complex methods like
on draw to handle drawing this image
view onto the screen note that as
developers we don't explicitly have to
call on draw to tell it to draw on to
the screen Android handles calling this
automatically for us but it is useful to
be able to call these methods to change
the image view for example so how do we
know what all the fields are inside the
state of an image view and what all the
methods are of this image view to answer
that question we have to look at the
class definition for that object it's a
file called text view Java similar to
how we define mainactivity.java inside
this class text view file we have a
bunch of code that talks about the state
of the text view as well as the methods
now it doesn't say staiin methods
exactly but it just contains information
on the state and contains information on
the methods you can think of this as
defining the rules of how a textview
behaves this object instance can hold
specific information like the text
string today or the text size 18 you can
also use this class to create even more
text view object instances these could
have a different texturing value like
this one could hold text that says hello
and this one could hold text that says
goodbye they could have different font
sizes different text colors in the
etcetera however they're all based off
of the class template you may find it
hard to distinguish between a class and
an object instance but that's okay it
takes some time to get used to here's an
analogy to help you you can think of it
as creating a floor plan for our house
you can use this floor plan to create
the actual homes each of these homes can
be slightly different but they're all
based off of this base floor plan it's
important to note that the floor plan is
not a house itself it's just a plan
similarly the textview class is used to
create these object instances so these
instances are the ones with the actual
text values text color values and text
sizes so what does one of these classes
look like</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
