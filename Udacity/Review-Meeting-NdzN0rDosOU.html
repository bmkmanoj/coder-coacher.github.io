talk for a minute about the review
meeting itself for effective reviews the
review meeting should be itself be
structured this includes the following
steps first off introduce the
participants to each other they might
not previously know each other in
particular one effective strategy would
be to bring in a member of a different
team who's you know has a similar level
of expertise but to put a different set
of eyes that may not be biased by the
you know common understanding second is
a statement of objectives by the
moderator this is a reminder the purpose
of the meeting is to raise concerns over
specific artifacts and not get diverted
into problem solving or other other
issues third is an evaluation of the
preparedness to determine whether the
meeting go forward this involves
checking with the reviewers as to
whether or not they have done their
preparation and to collect their issues
that they've already found and also to
check whether the artifact itself is
ready for review next is the systematic
review itself using some means of
ensuring thoroughness and we'll look at
some of those in a minute this is where
the term walkthrough is very important
they actually going through the artifact
in a very systematic step-by-step
fashion to make sure the whole thing is
covered during this process the
recording of results in the form of the
issues raised on the review form after
the systematic review but still inside
the meeting there should be some kind of
summarization often led by the recorder
of the issues raised including a
determination of severity Zand
priorities finally a determination of
who is responsible for looking into
these issues in many cases it will be
the author but it may be that in certain
cases somebody else gets assigned to do
that there also should be an agreement
about how resolution will be verified
with respect to is it the moderators
responsibility the authors or is there
going to be a review</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
