psychologists also study forgetting and
memory loss
now forgetting and memory loss are
subjective and reconstructive processes
sometimes it's easy to think of our
memory as an objective recorder when in
fact we see that our memories are
affected by how we distort select or
even bias memory of events so forgetting
is the weakening of memories over time
and I'm going to share a personal
example of that with you next when we
think about forgetting we think about
things who may have learned in school
such as definitions equations or
formulas but we can also forget personal
episodic memories for example my dad
died when I was only 14 years old and
for some time after that I had lots of
memories of everyday activities things
such as eating dinner going for ice
cream or even watching TV however one
day when I was about 16 years old I
realized I'd forgotten what my dad
sounded like now in those days we didn't
have video cameras or phones with
cameras on them so I had no film of my
dad talking when I remember this I was
so angry and upset with myself I was
beside myself I thought how could you
forget what your own father sounds like
what kind of a daughter am i if I can't
even remember what my dad sounded like
now I have since learned not to be so
hard on myself for forgetting those
things because I hadn't been exposed to
it in such a long time however I do try
to actively recall and remember more
memories so I don't lose those now as an
example of just how subjective memory
can be my brother and a friend of ours
recently got together who we hadn't seen
in 20 years and we were talking about
this time that we all went down to the
stream we caught a carp we brought it
back to my mom each of us had a
different memory of what my mom said and
did when she saw that fish so we can see
just to how individual and subjective
our memories can be perhaps you can talk
to your parents or siblings and see if
you can come up with a memory and
whether or not you all agree on that's
