is we talked to a developer who told us
how he became a Salesforce developer and
how he uses it every day I'm David Liu
I'm a Salesforce developer at Google and
I dream in Salesforce I graduated school
with a marketing degree didn't know how
to write a single line of code but
marketing always works with sales and
that's how I got started with Salesforce
and just do - you know circumstances on
the job I dabbled a little encode and
and I fell in love it was love at first
sight and and from there you know I just
went all the way forward with it and you
know I told myself wow I love this so
much you know in 20 years time if I
looked back in my life and and I didn't
know how to code then you know I'd be
really disappointed myself so so I
picked up Salesforce coding and and yeah
now I'm doing what I love the Salesforce
it's really like a like a playground you
can build anything you want with it like
I've seen people build apps for
recruiting I've seen people build video
games on Salesforce you can build
websites it's really up to your
imagination what sales forces there's a
lot of things you don't have to worry
about when you're coding in Salesforce
when you're coding in other languages
there's these things called boilerplate
code just code that you have to write
that it's meaningless that's totally
unreadable that you have to write just
so that your code works in Salesforce
every line of code you write is is
directly relevant to your app it's all
business logic so there's two ways you
can build things in Salesforce you can
do the point click way or you can code
and and most of the time you're actually
doing a little bit of both I started
with point click started not knowing
anything about coding whatsoever the
skills that you learn we're doing
point-and-click
it's absolutely super important for
coding you cannot be a good Salesforce
developer without knowing the
point-and-click stuff really well the
reason for that is there's so much you
can do with point-and-click if you can
do it without code you always want to do
it without code one really cool thing
about Salesforce is how quickly you can
become good on the platform how quickly
you can become a good developer from not
knowing
to code a single line in six months time
you can probably learn enough to get a
job as a sales force developer I love
Salesforce yes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
