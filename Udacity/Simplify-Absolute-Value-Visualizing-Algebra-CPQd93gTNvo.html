absolute value I'm going to apply the
order of operations and then the
absolute value to get my answer absolute
value acts as a grouping symbol I need
to evaluate any expressions inside of it
first but it's a particular grouping
symbol because it means the distance
from zero so whenever I get my answer I
need to figure out how far is that
answer from zero I have the absolute
value of the negative of three squared
plus 2 times 4 squared remember whenever
there's a negative sign standing alone
it's really a negative 1 times so I'm
going to have my absolute value I'll
have 3 squared which is nine the
negative one right before it then plus 2
times 4 squared when I look at what to
do next I know I still have a power I'm
going to do 4 squared 4 times 4 is 16
now I'm going to do the multiplication
negative 1 times 9 is negative 9 and 2
times 16 is 32 i'm going to add 32 and
negative 9 or 32 minus 9 and i get the
absolute value of 23 the absolute value
or the distance of 23 from 0 is 23 okay
for the second problem i have the
negative of the absolute value of
negative 9 minus 3 times the quantity 5
minus 2 squared remember here's a
negative side standing alone so I really
have negative 1 times this value so
negative ones on the outside I have an
absolute value symbol when thinking
about what to do next I need to start
with this inside parentheses I'm going
to go ahead and list negative 9-3 for
this inside parentheses I'll do five
minus two squared I know 2 squared is 4
so i have 5 minus for my negative 1 is
still in the outside I have absolute
value of negative 9 minus 3 times 1 now
i'm going to do multiplication add the
absolute value of negative 3 minus 3
minus 9 and minus 3 is negative 12 so I
have minus one on my outside and minus
12 inside my absolute value when I
take the absolute value of negative 12 I
get positive 12 the distance or the
absolute value of negative 12 from zero
is 12 so i have negative 1 times a 12
notice that when i take the absolute
value of something I no longer need to
write the symbol absolute value I've
taken its positive distance from zero
the distance of negative 12 from 0 is 12
then my final answer i have negative 1
times 12 or negative 12</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
