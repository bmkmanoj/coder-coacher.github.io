captain of a ship on the high seas and
you know there's some enemy ship about
200 meters away you want to aim your
candidate at some angle alpha and shoot
the cannon ball with some initial
velocity V naught such that you hit the
enemy ship unfortunately there's this 40
meter tall iceberg about 110 meters away
from you which makes your shot a lot
more difficult because you have to go
over the iceberg so what angle alpha an
initial speed v-not should you use such
that you hit the enemy ship now there
are actually a lot of answers here but
we're just looking for one that works
one that works will hit the enemy ship
and not hit the iceberg to answer this
question we're going to use a slightly
different form of input than we normally
do this window here contains computer
code and you may have used this window
before if you've taken a computer
science class at Udacity we're only
going to focus on these two numbers here
these two are the important ones you
don't need to worry about these line
this line up here and this line down
here you only need to look at these two
and you're going to take this line
initial velocity equals 50 and replace
the 50 with what you want your initial
velocity to be so if you wanted your
initial velocity to be 60 meters per
second then you replace the 50 with a 60
you don't need to include the units and
if you wanted the launch angle to be 20
degrees they need you to place this 10
with 20 again you don't need to write
the word degrees or anything like that
so once you're ready to fire the cannon
with this initial velocity and this
launch angle go down here and press the
Run button so after you press run you'll
be able to scroll down and see a nice
graph of what the trajectory of your
cannonball look like so I've scrolled
down and now I get this nice graph of my
cannon balls trajectory and as you can
tell it looked like it was doing all
right it was headed towards the ship but
unfortunately it hit the iceberg so next
time I'm gonna have to aim either a bit
higher or give it a bit more oomph to
try and hit the enemy ship so feel free
to toy around with your values and try
and hit the ship just by guess and check
or you can solve it directly and then
hit the ship that way either way once
you hit the ship you'll get this nice
boom animation and then you know you
have the answer so once you've hit the
enemy ship you should scroll up and then
press submit to submit your homework for
grading now currently my cannonball
doesn't work quite right because it hits
the iceberg so I get this try again
message but once you hit the ship
you should get a you got a correct
message and that way you know your
homeworks been counted</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
