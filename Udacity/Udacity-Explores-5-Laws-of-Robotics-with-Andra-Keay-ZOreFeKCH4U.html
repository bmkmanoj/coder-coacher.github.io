you start talking about it can interact
with the person and the person could
relate to it but we can always turn off
a switch yeah when you're dealing with
something like that is there ever a
point where you start looking at it from
the other perspective of like wow this
thing actually has feelings and emotions
right so we've seen videos I'm sure
you've seen them a well as Boston
Dynamics is big dog where people have
you know the engineers have shown
kicking this robot right and have a bit
scuffle but generally most drengo
all when they see that exactly it
encourages that however one of the
things I've also seen is that people
that are more from the new robots don't
have quite that shocked pity feeling so
they've become much more used to what
they're seeing and they'll have a
different level of response and I think
it comes back down to saying you know
don't confuse the snapshot for the whole
picture one of the ID I've got five what
I call laws of robotics because we all
love their smarts laws of robotics even
though they don't work they never going
to work and even though I think laws is
the wrong really the wrong terminology
to use I think to be effective laws kind
of come later what we really want to be
talking about is design guidelines
suggestions that can educate and inform
people towards better decisions at the
earliest possible stages of building
robots but I call them five laws of
robotics and they start really at the
most critical level in terms of Maslow's
hierarchy of needs which is don't build
killing machines
and while drones in warfare maybe they
are currently accepted but they have
less they're a bit of a mix they're
informational they can do other things
they're not necessarily weapons
I think the key concept there is if you
build something that is nothing but a
killing machine
then it's very difficult to have some
other purpose for it so the key
principle is always build a
multi-purpose robot not something that
is purely evil and then the next one
down is build things that obey laws and
it might seem obvious but there are some
really clear areas like does this robot
breach privacy law and are you aware of
what privacy law in different countries
is so when you're putting sensors onto
something are they going to be
law-abiding or not and we do start to
run into issues where you have a lot of
senses of required for autonomous
vehicles for mobile robots and they're
going to start to be traveling in areas
where they can be unpredicted data
breaches privacy breaches surveillance
issues so can you think through these
things ahead of time those laws exist
because there is a social standard that
we've come to agree on so you have to
inform yourself as to why they exist and
how what you build might end up putting
you on the wrong side of those things
ultimately the other laws relate to
building things that don't create the
wrong expectation so build a robot
system that is as transparent as
possible so that you understand as much
as possible about what its intentions
are and what its capabilities are what
is able to do and for me that is you
know don't be deceptive and don't build
deceptive robots a robot that's humanoid
is going to create the impression in us
that it is capable of humanoid level
behaviors and the reality is that it's
not you know but we're going to think
that it can remember us from time to
time we're going to think that if it
uses emotional hand gestures that it's
going to be able to understand
our emotional state that it will
understand things like proximity and
body space so you get into a lot of
trouble because at the moment we don't
really have that level of understanding
or intelligence so I think that there
are reasons for building robots that can
have a good social interaction but at
the moment I think you need to keep them
in a very narrow domain so that you
don't start to imagine you've got a
general purpose friend now what you have
is a very helpful assistant driver or a
very helpful medicine cabinet teacher
you don't have a friend or something
else and within that there are also
other areas around transparency which
relate to is it possible for other
people to understand how something is
making its decisions and how its
operating which comes down to you know
algorithmic transparency as well we're
incorporating a lot of black boxes into
what we do and I know that's probably a
problem that you've covered elsewhere so
ultimately from that is avoid black
boxes and avoid over featuring a robot
you know don't be humanoid if you don't
need to be some of the best robots ones
like same a field robotics Curie it
doesn't have a screen it doesn't have a
lot of features it acts more like a toy
than a humanoid interpreter it makes
sure that you can appreciate its limits
much more and I think also Cattleya
health Nabu and that's something that I
see in the best robot designs they focus
on can you do what you do well rather
than trying to do everything and
ultimately there's one final guideline
is can we tell who who is responsible
for a robot who owns it do we have any
kind of idea about registration license
plates for robots or something else like
that because
you're definitely already seeing robots
in public places and the westfield
shopping malls for example in the
streets of redwood city delivering food
in san francisco streets and over here
for hearth and as a airport now who is
having that interaction with you right
is it the robot or is it you know the
person who's program well the robots at
the front of that right but is that an
interaction on behalf of San Jose
Airport or is it an interaction on
behalf of the third-party who is using
the space at San Jose Airport who do you
contact if that robot runs over your
toddler's toes okay
all of these things but the physical
potential harm and the economic and
emotional potential harm that can happen
in these situations you need to be able
to say whose robot is that and I foresee
a time coming up very soon where we have
a lot of robots engaged in advertising
and sales not just delivery and as such
it's not hard to create something that
gives us the illusion of that can
capture our attention okay you know a
billboard even if it's a moving
billboard it's not going to capture our
attention anywhere near as much as a
humanoid object that can also use some
movement and some other visual cues to
capture our attention because ultimately
we're still chimpanzees in terms of our
responses there are certain things that
will trigger our responses then what is
the purpose the robot is probably there
to be conducting business of some kind
and are you going to be as informed and
as in charge of that relationship as you
would be if it was a person saying would
you like to have a free sample of this
and would you like to come into the shop
and try this on or all of those other
things that were used to humans saying
and we're used to ignoring or we're used
to being able to assess who they are
what they're doing and why they're doing
it
so that's in the
is the last area of real transparency
where the license plates and where's the
chain of responsibility and how do we
have access to it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
