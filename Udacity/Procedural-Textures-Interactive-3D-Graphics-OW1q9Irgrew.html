applied to a model however these sorts
of mappings are only skin-deep if we
compromise any part of the object the
fact that a 2d texture is getting used
is revealed what we'd like is something
that's more like a real material the
solution is to create a 3d texture that
fills space one way to define this
texture is to actually create something
like a stack of images
unfortunately 3d textures are not yet
available in WebGL my guess is wait a
year
another method is to make a function
that takes in a point on a surface and
gives back a color if you think about it
these are equivalent in intent using
images also takes in a 3d point and
gives back a color each approach has its
strengths and weakness's functions have
an unlimited resolution compared to
textures but you also have to be careful
to filter their results while I'm at it
I should mention you can shade points on
surfaces however you want with a
fragment shader program here's an
example of animated procedural textures
in use these examples are 2d functions
they don't fill space but show how
elaborate effects can be computed on the
fly in the fragment shader</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
