question and I really just wanted you to
try to come up with one on your own one
possible explanation would be that
although both individuals have the same
genetics for these eight factors one
individual woman too suffered more
spontaneous mutations from her
environment while the other had fewer
this means that she had more repair to
do and couldn't get it done as
efficiently as woman one another
explanation could be that woman 2 had
additional genetic factors that damaged
the repair mechanisms are encouraged to
more growth or maybe woman 1 had genetic
factors that actually helped protect her
the bottom line is these would be
differences for other unknown genetic
factors between the two women most
likely the answer to this question is
probably a little bit of all of these
things</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
