identity transformation we're not
actually doing any work here for
everything in one two three just put
that in the output that will totally
work here we're going to take 012 but
we're going to add one to each so 0 plus
1 is 1 1 plus 1 is to 2 plus 1 is 3
that'll get us the output we expect here
we're going to do the reverse and
subtract this will be negative 1 0 1
that's not what we were hoping for here
we're going to divide a bit 3/2 is 1.5
that's kind of close but 6 divided by 2
is 3 this is not getting us the answer
we want in the right order and finally
over here the length of a is 1-2 in the
is 3 so we get the answer as we expect
so here I've written those answers out
explicitly in Python in the interpreter
and we're just going to check and see
that we got the answers that we expected
one two three one two three that's good
this was much too low here the division
didn't work out properly but in the last
one that worked out fine we could
totally fix this last one if we divide
by three instead we will get one two
three one two three but it was off by
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
