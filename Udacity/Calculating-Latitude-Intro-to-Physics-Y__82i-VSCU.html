of Cancer though I'm not sure if we
actually used that word the city of CNA
where Eratosthenes saw the sun shining
vertically down a well was located in
the Tropic of Cancer the Sun isn't
always directly above the Tropic of
Cancer as it happened to be on the
summer solstice in fact due to the tilt
of the earth the Sun can be directly
overhead anywhere between the Tropic of
Cancer the equator and another imaginary
line 23.5 degrees south of the equator
known as the Tropic of Capricorn the
sun's directly over the Tropic of Cancer
on the summer solstice and directly over
the equator on what's known as the
equinoxes it's directly over the other
tropic on the winter solstice I'm using
a northern hemisphere bias here if
you're in the southern hemisphere you
probably refer to this as the winter
solstice now thinking back to what we
did in unit 1 let's say you're standing
at some unknown latitude and remember
your latitude will just be this angle
here which I've labeled alpha and let's
say it happens to be one of the
equinoxes so the Sun is directly above
the equator and you do an experiment you
look at a vertical object measure its
shadow and do some trigonometry to find
that the angle here I've labeled alpha
is equal to 40 degrees so what we need
to tell me for this measured angle of 40
degrees and remember this is when the
Sun is highest in the sky and the Sun is
directly overhead on the equator so it's
one of the equinoxes what is your
latitude enter your answer in degrees
here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
