the unit two homeworks remember we had
two parts of this we had the the rot13
tool and then we had the the signup page
that tested for errors and that sort of
thing so I will show you quick quickly
my versions working and then I'll show
you the code so let's start with the
rot13
okay here's my rot13 running on my local
machine here I can't I can type in some
text and if I submit it gets rot13
inside the textbox and if I submit again
it gets changed back to the original
text and that's how you know it's
working it escapes properly we're going
to see that by typing in our closed text
area there and it's preserving
everything all right so let's take a
peek at the code okay so I'm in an app
engine app I file this is the base rot13
Handler that I wrote it inherits from
this base handler class the rot13 class
does that added some convenience
functions so first I have a write
function and all this is sort hand so I
can say self dot right instead of self
dot response that out that right
you know just save some typing and then
I started using something called
templates and I'm gonna spend a little
bit more time on templates in um in unit
3 it's it saves me the effort of having
to type in all the the string
substitutions that you've probably did
for this homework at home if you didn't
already get tired of that and figure out
templates my base page well let's let's
look at the URL handler first so we've
got slash unit 2 slash brought 13 maps
to the rot13 class and so we come up
here to our rot13 class and it's got two
functions it's got a get function and
all this does is it renders this file
called rot13 - format HTML now your
version you may be you may have printed
a whole string this accomplishes that
same thing I'll go ahead and show you
that file it's right here I we want to
get in the habit going forward of of
starting to separate these things and I
apologize for putting you through that
heartache of writing out long strings
first but you'll appreciate the niceness
of this once you've done it the hard way
so this just returns some HTML it's got
our title it's got our in h2 which makes
some big text at the top of the page
our form it's Methodist Post and it's
got a text area the text area has a name
of text I added a little styling here to
make it a to make it a little bigger
this is just some basic CSS you know
you're free to copy this from my demo
you know when I put the source stuff
online this syntax here again we'll talk
about this more in the next lesson but
instead of doing a string substitution
this substitutes the variable text
passed into the template and it
automatically escapes it for me so I
don't have to deal with that and this
closes the text area and then there's a
submit button that's pretty simple if I
were to turn off the auto escaping
ability which is set by this parameter
here let me show you the behavior of
that okay so here we've got some text in
here remember I disabled the texting or
R I'm sorry I disabled the escaping so
let's see what happens when we when we
submit this that works the first time
but the second time the text jumps
outside the box why did that happen well
when we turn that that rot13 text area
back into a closing text area it
actually closed our text area in the
HTML and then put this text outside it
if I were to view the source of this
file which you can do in Chrome easily
we can see what happened you can see my
template and then you can see my text
area gets closed by the unescape version
of that text and then escapes properly
gets put outside the text area and then
here's the closing text area for my
template so we want to make sure we go
back to our editor here and I turn on
turn on escaping again this is something
you're probably doing by hand which is
how we learn to do it initially and if I
were to go to Chrome and then reload
this page reload that's going to confirm
the form submission we can see that my
text area actually got escaped and so
this is what the template has and this
is how it renders now what's interesting
to note is that even though our HTML has
the escaped version of less-than and
greater-than when it renders as
less-than and greater-than and when we
submit the form
it's as less-than and greater-than it's
not as the escaped version so hopefully
you had a chance to kind of experiment
that and see for yourself but um that's
how that works
