several graphs I had to use a set of
axes one for each variable that we have
in our equation the standard way to set
this up is to label the horizontal axis
the x axis sisty markets our X values
change and the vertical axis the y-axis
showing how Y values change now every
point on this plane is associated with
both a value in the horizontal direction
and x value and a value in the vertical
direction a y-value I also mentioned
earlier that we identify points on our
coordinate plane with a special notation
the first number listed is our x
coordinate or our horizontal position
and the second number in the ordered
pair is the y coordinate or the vertical
position of the point the areas that you
see on the ends of each axis represent
continuation so the x axis continues all
the way out to infinity and also in the
other direction all the way out to
negative infinity and the same is true
of the y axis so this coordinate plane
we're really able to represent if we
want to take as much time and paper as
possible any combination of two real
numbers and then of course we can depict
it graphically there's one single point
on this graph however one point out of
that infinite number of points that's
really special and we call it the origin
which point of all these ones
highlighted in teal do you think is
special enough to have such an
illustrious title as the origin click
where you think it is</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
