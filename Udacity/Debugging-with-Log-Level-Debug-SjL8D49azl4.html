read and write from firebase you might
have noticed that to update a piece of
data there are a lot of moving parts you
can call a right method to update the
data then the data is changed in the
firebase database this triggers your
listeners which you've added and finally
the UI is updated with so much going on
when you're trying to debug what might
be going wrong anywhere in this process
it can be a little tricky so let me tell
you about a helpful method that I've
been using to track what my code is
sending and receiving from the firebase
database so here I am in my shopping
list application class if you find that
you need to debug your app you can type
the following in firebase get default
config dot set log level logger dot
level debug this turns on firebase is
debug mode and in debug mode you get a
printout of useful data in the logs
about what is sent to and received from
from firebase so let's run the app and
see this in action with the a prop and
running I can open up the logcat output
and change it from verbose to debug okay
so I've cleared the logs I'm gonna go
ahead and add a shopping list and we can
see here that in the logs I actually get
a lot of information about what was just
set and where it was set I made this
list called let's go shopping with an
anonymous owner and here's the timestamp
info and here it shows the data that was
being sent through I could scroll over a
little bit and if I go over to my
dashboard I can see that it is in fact
been sent to the database knowing how to
both use the debug logger level and to
make sure that you keep checking what's
going on in the dashboard will help you
really make sure that your app doesn't
have any bugs in it so now whenever you
run into a bug you can always try
turning on the debug longer level as
well as comparing what's going on in the
dashboard</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
