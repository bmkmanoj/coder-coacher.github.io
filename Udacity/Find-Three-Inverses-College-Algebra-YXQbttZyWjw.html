look at the steps we've gone through
over the past few quizzes to move from f
of X 2 F inverse of X first we change
variable names from f of X to Y just to
make our manipulations a little bit
easier then we did something that's
generally not legal when we're modifying
equations we switch the positions of x
and y in our equation this is a really
important step because it's in this step
that we're actually switching from the
original function to the inverse
function after that we rearranged our
variables once more so that y was by
itself on one side then since we know
this is the inverse function to make
that clear we changed the name of Y to F
inverse of X showing its relationship
with the original equation we started
out with I think it will be worth it to
have a bit more practice finding the
inverses of functions so let's do that
I've written three functions here for
you f of x equals x plus 1 G of x equals
one-fourth times X minus 9 + h of x
equals x cubed for each of these
functions I'd like you to find its
inverse if you're having trouble
remembering what to do and why then
please go back and just watch the past
few videos or just review the beginning
of this quiz</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
