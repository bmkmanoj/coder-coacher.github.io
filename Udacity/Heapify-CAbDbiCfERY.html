could take the approach we used with
bsts start at the root then move down
the tree one level at a time and do
comparisons until we find an open spot
however if our element is bigger than
most of the parent nodes or even the
root we'll need to shuffle the tree
around a lot as such we take a different
approach to inserting here we can stick
the new element in the next open spot in
the tree then we heapify heapify is the
operation in which we reorder the tree
based on the heap property since we care
that our parent element is bigger than
its child we just need to keep comparing
our new element with its parent and
swapping them when the child is bigger
we can take a similar approach to an
extract operation where the root is
removed from the tree we stick the
rightmost leaf in the root spot then
just compare it to its children and swap
where necessary the runtime of insert
and delete a more general case of
extract ends up being oh of log n in the
worst case ultimately the worst case
would involve moving an element all the
way up or down the tree and would
roughly be as many operations as the
height of the tree</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
