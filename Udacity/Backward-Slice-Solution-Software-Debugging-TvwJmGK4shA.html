here in quote equals not quote this is
control dependent on this earlier
statement which again reads from see
that we've seen the dependencies of C
before but it also reads from tagged so
this is dependent on all the places that
tag is being set and then again this is
up to this one up here and then again
where the tag is being set a nut implies
a control dependency towards the
governing conditions what's usually more
interesting than the backwards lies
itself is what is not contained in the
backward slice that is the statements
that are not checked what you see in
here is the statements that are not part
of the backward slice are statements
that refer to out setting out checking
out and returning out but nothing of
what happens to out actually has any
effect on tagged at this point and this
is precisely what the backward slice
gives us it tells us if you want to know
why this statement was executed well we
know it can't depend on out because
there's no dependency of tag towards out
in any way or out cannot influence the
value of tag in any way</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
