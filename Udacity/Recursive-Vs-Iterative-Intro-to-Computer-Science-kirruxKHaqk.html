recursively we can also write without
using a recursive definition and I want
to show you another way that we might
have defined is palindrome so here we're
doing this with a for loop and we're
looping using the variable I and the
range from 0 to the length of s divided
by 2 so that's going through halfway of
s and inside the loop we have an if test
that checks if the character position I
is different from the character at
position negative I plus 1 so that's
going to be counting from the back of
the string I positions away if those are
different then we found a mismatch and
we return false if they're not different
we're going to keep going through the
loop once we get to the end of the loop
without finding any differences we know
it's a palindrome and we return true so
this is also another way we could define
is palindrome I think this is more
complicated to understand and harder to
get right it took me three tries before
this code worked correctly
whereas the recursive definition I could
get right the first time if we wanted to
test very long palindromes this would be
much more efficient than the code that
we had with the recursive definition and
there are a couple reasons for that
one is that the recursive definition
keeps making new strings every time we
do the recursive call we have to create
a new string and that's pretty expensive
another reason is that the recursive
calls themselves are fairly expensive
and there are languages that make
recursive calls fairly cheap Python is
not one of them and Python is fairly
expensive to do a recursive call so for
most procedures the recursive way is
often the most elegant and the easiest
way to get correct if we're really
worried about performance and we need
procedures to work on really large
inputs we're often better off trying to
find a non recursive way of defining
that procedure</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
