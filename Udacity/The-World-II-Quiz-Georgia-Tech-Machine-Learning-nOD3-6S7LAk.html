bit Michael okay that last one was
really easy and it was easy for a bunch
of reasons but one of the reasons it was
easy is that every time you took an
action it did exactly what you expected
it to do now I want to introduce a
little bit of uncertainty or
stochasticity into the world so let me
tell you exactly what that means when
you execute an action it executes
correctly with probability of 0.8 so 80%
of time if you go up it goes up assuming
you can go up if it goes if you say down
it goes down assuming you can left it
goes left right it goes right got it
yeah now 20% of the time the action you
take actually causes you to move at a
right angle
now of course they're two different
right angles you could go to if you go
up you could go either left or right at
a right angle and so that 20% gets
distributed uniformly okay that makes
sense yeah I think so and so if you if
you're in the start state and you try to
go up then there's a 10% chance that you
would attempt to bump into the wall yes
and then you just stay where you are I
guess right so if you if you decided to
exit the up action here you have a 80%
chance of moving up you have a 10%
chance of moving to the right you have a
10% chance of moving to the left but of
course you would bump a wall and you
would end up right back where you
started
got it yeah okay good so here is my quiz
question for you Michael
do you recall we came up with two
sequences and the one that I decided to
keep was up up right right right my
question to you is what is the
reliability of the sequence up up right
right actually getting you from the
start to the goal given these
probabilities this uncertainty and so
we're just gonna try that sequence and
ask whether or not it actually got us to
the goal exactly and when I say
reliability I really mean what's the
probability of it actually succeeding
interesting okay all right so let's see
if we can figure out the answer you
ready I'm ready all right go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
