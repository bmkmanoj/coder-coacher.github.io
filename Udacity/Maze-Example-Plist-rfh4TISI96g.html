might use this data let's actually build
the maze from RP list and our JSON file
now before we do that if we go back to
our pls file I want to make sure
everyone notices that the root of this
plist file is a dictionary instead of an
array and this is also true of the JSON
file because the first and the last
characters are these curly braces which
are indicative of a JSON object and a
JSON object can be converted quite
easily into a dictionary and Swift now
the first thing we've done is to find
this enum called may sell direction and
the most important thing about this enum
is that its raw type is of int and what
this thing is going to allow us to do is
it's giving us value 0 and that's going
to be one two and three and these will
map to the indexes in these bulleen
arrays so instead of having to refer to
the first element as the 0th element we
can use easier to read names like top
right bottom and left so it's a little
trick that I've used many times I'd
recommend you to try it yourself then as
we said both in the plist and the JSON
file these things are dictionaries so
we're going to start with a function
that takes a dictionary and we're going
to return a string and the string we're
going to return is going to be really
really long but it's going to be what
allows us to visualize it here as
opposed to how we visualize it in the
actual maze app the first thing we want
to do is make sure that the keys exist
so we need to have a row count a column
count and sell data and if we have all
of those key value pairs then let's make
our maze string or really really long
string representing the maze now this
function here that make may string
function is where all the magic happens
the first thing we do is initialize a
string called final string to the empty
string and then what we're going to do
is we're going to loop through row by
row to create our string so we'll
imagine here that we're looking at the
first row and for each row we're going
to pass through the column data three
times and I'll show you why the first
time we're going to create the top
section of the string so that's created
the top section of this first row of
grid cells the second time we go through
the columns we're going to create the
middle section and there's our mid
section for this row of grid cells and
then the third time will create the
bottom section and so for each pass that
we're making we're appending to the
string and we get to the end of a
section to get to the new line here
you'll notice the back in the code we're
adding a new line so let's look at that
now and there you can see so this is our
first pass then our new line our second
pass another new line and then our third
pass and the final new line now you may
have noticed this special case where if
the row is 1 and the column is 0 we're
going to insert this little star icon
for the middle section and we'll see
what that looks like in just a second
and the reason we did this is mainly for
show we just want it to more closely
mimic one of the mazes from the maze app
now these next two functions make top or
bottom section and make middle section
there would actually looks at the array
of bulls and determines which kind of
string we want to append so is it a
string that contains walls or a string
that doesn't contain any walls then when
we finally make it to the bottom here we
can create our maze in three lines of
code not a bad days work so this looks
similar to what we saw for the students
plist example we're creating the path to
maze 1 dot P list and then we're loading
this into a dictionary instead of an
array and then we call our function
visualize maze with the dictionary that
we've loaded from the plist</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
