on your computer but if you want to
follow along this example feel free to
download the zip file in the instructor
notes when you unzip that file you'll
have a folder much like this one with
about 50 photos okay so what I've done
this file is just created a new file in
idle and I called it a rename underscore
files PI and inside that I've created an
empty function by the same name
then I added comments of the two main
things I have to do in my program by the
way notice that the function right now
is pretty empty and if I saved and ran
the program it would essentially do
nothing the first thing I have to do is
get the file names from a given folder
so Google can help with that let me just
type in find file names in a folder in
Python now I read through the results
and I go to this stack overflow dot-com
page and here I read that there is this
thing called OS dot lister which will
get you everything that's in a given
directory now it turns out that there is
a module in Python called OS short for
operating system and that has a function
inside it called list R which as its
name suggests lists everything that's in
a given directory so let's add this to
the code and see what it does now this
function lister takes in a path of the
folder that contains our photos so I'll
go back to my folder copy its address
and paste it now for those of you that
are on a Mac you can use a document in
the instructor notes that will help you
get the path of your folder on a Windows
machine however right before where the
path begins I will add this letter R and
R stands for raw path and it tells
python hey take the string as it is and
don't interpret it any other way so here
let me just save this in a variable and
print that out let me save and then run
and oh wow we get a list of all of the
file names inside that folder it's an
ugly looking list but Alissa nonetheless
alright step one of the program is done</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
