all right you know in fact let me go
back to something here if I turn on a
red light in a green light and I blend
them together what color will I see
yellow yellow right so why when I tell
people this at Georgia Tech some of them
tell me oh well you know red is here on
the spectrum and green is here in the
spectrum and we turn on both of them you
get the average spectrum no the light
doesn't know anything about averaging so
here is a green light and here is a red
light what happens is this light over
here in the green triggers the green
cones a little bit more than the red
cones and the red light makes the red
cones go a little bit more than the
green cones okay so let's pretend for a
moment they were sort of balanced so in
other words if I had a yellow light
which makes both of the cones go about
the same amount your system can't tell
the difference between a green light and
a red light turned on vs a yellow light
forget this little blue stuff here for
now all right so the reason that red
plus green make yellow with lights has
nothing to do with physics and
everything to do with how your retina is
put together right the red and green
cones go on at the same time so color is
psychological that is you can think of
colors represented as some combination
linear combination otherwise of red
green and blue and it's related to cones
not to physics by the way almost all of
us have the same cones but there are
some people who don't right so the sky
might not really look blue to them
although actually to them it looks blue
but it's actually not blue because they
actually can't see blue so these people
are referred to as colorblind all right
a bunch of people are missing one type
of cone almost all of them by the way
our men it's it's some reasonable
percentage of men are colorblind some
tiny tiny percentage of women are
colorblind so it's kind of funny but
back when I was a grad student
psychology class people have to
sometimes do it so I was the TA people
would have to do an experiment
and write it up and hand it in and you
could tell every now and then when
somebody shall we say ran out of time to
actually do a real experiment because
they'd say they worked with 20 color
blind patients 10 men 10 women for them
to find 10 color blind women they
probably would have sample more than
Massachusetts so they're very few
colorblind way</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
