droplets of water that have a mass of
one gram here and they're falling a
distance of 1.5 meters when we measure
their final speed we found that they
were going at 4 meters per second which
is less than we expect so now we have to
figure out how much work was done by air
resistance in order to slow down this
one gram drop of water to 4 meters per
second so the first thing we know is
that the total work done on the drop of
water must be equal to its change in
kinetic energy that's just the work
energy theorem and what's the total work
equal to well it's just equal to the
work done by gravity minus the work done
by friction and we know that the work
done by gravity is just equal to the
force of gravity times the distance it
acts over and we also know that the
change in kinetic energy is just equal
to the final kinetic energy minus the
original kinetic energy since the drop
start at rest we know that they have no
original kinetic energy so this term we
can cross out now we can plug in mg for
the force of gravity and we can use
one-half MV final squared for the final
kinetic energy and solving for the work
done by friction I get this equation
here finally when I plug in all my
numbers here I get that the work done by
friction on a single drop of water has
to be equal to 0 point zero zero seven
