happy but what about the others so I
suggest that we take a look at Dave here
and Dave as you remember he was working
on a logistics problem so what he was
trying to solve was shortest tour and
actually last time we left off Dave
wasn't too happy because we found out
that it is not very easy to find a good
search tree or a pre-processing strategy
for his problem on the other hand of
course we also mentioned that in
practice shortest tour is usually very
easy to solve but from a theoretical
perspective maybe we're a bit lucky for
Dave if we're not looking for the best
possible solution but except an
approximation and then if we should find
an approximation Dave can get a little
happier here and of course he doesn't
have to be as jealous that Alice has
such a nice np-complete problem and he
seems to have a harder one now lucky for
Dave there is a constant factor
approximation algorithm for shortest
tour but since dave is not that
proficient in theoretical computer
science I think he doesn't really stand
a chance of coming up with this
algorithm himself so you will have to
pay close attention now to be able to
explain it to Dave the concept that we
will use is that of a spanning tree and
if you've had an algorithms course
before he will know what a spanning tree
is but I'm quickly going to explain it
to you just to make sure a spanning tree
is a part of a graph or actually it's a
selection of edges in a graph so that
the result looks like a tree well what
that means is that you select edges so
that you still keep the whole graph
connected but you don't have any cycles
so the cycle would be something like
this where you can leave a vertex and
then come back to it another way so you
select edges so that the whole graph is
still connected but there can be no
cycles so to have you figure this out
let's do a quick quiz here this is the
same network 3 times and I'm going to
give you 3 choices of what a spanning
tree could be and the red edges are
always those that I'm selecting here I
would like you to tell me in which of
these cases the red edges form a
spanning tree for the graph</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
