about domains is browsers generally all
have a preferences page and Here I am in
Chrome's preferences if I go to under
the hood and I click on content settings
I can actually choose some relevant
options basically for cookies we can
allow all data to be set and this
basically says you know a lot all all
cookies to be set now the next option
basically says only set cookies that
exist in this current session so when I
close my browser all those cookies will
disappear you know we can block sites
from setting setting any cookies
or we could block cookies or web sites
from setting setting third-party cookies
so that means AFRICOM makes a request to
Google com we won't accept any Google
com cookies because our browser says
reddit even though we might make
requests you know for images or other
things from other domains and you know
another option clear cookies so you know
this is kind of well-trodden ground to
set you know which which domains are
allowed to set what cookies and
generally I usually check this this box
it prevents web sites from linking to
third-party data and then having them
you know fill your browser with the add
jackin stuff so anyway I just thought
you should be aware that these are now
you have more information of how cookie
domains work and what's allowed to set
what and you can even restrict it even
further or the user can so you want to
be sure that you know you're not
operating under the assumption that your
cookies may always be allowed and may
always be there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
