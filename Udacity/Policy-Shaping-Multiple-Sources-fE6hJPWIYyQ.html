on that last thing that you asked me
we've just been talking about how to
compute probabilities of optimal actions
based upon what human beings are giving
us and that's fine but it turns out we
actually have multiple sources of
information and we would like to be able
to combine them in particular we have
some policy that we've learned that
gives us a probability distribution over
actions that we learn from the human
that's why it says PI sub H here and you
notice here I'm treating a policy as a
probability distribution over actions
and that's all kind of neat and these in
fact are the numbers that we came up
with in our last quiz
but while the agent is running around in
the world the agent has information from
running around in the world right their
rewards I've actually gone through and
played pac-man and I've been eating and
I've won and I've gone through rooms and
I've done all these kinds of things and
it seems kind of silly to ignore what I
actually know about what's going on in
the world particularly in the case where
a human being might in fact be incorrect
sometimes or may really believe that the
optimal policy is one thing but in fact
for the underlying MVP the optimal
policy is something else so I just want
to ask you a couple of really simple
questions let's imagine that I've got
some algorithm that runs around in the
world on its own and learns
distributions over actions in every
given state okay and it says after a
little while that the probability that
action X is optimal is a third action Y
is optimal as a third and action Z is
being optimal is also a third and so now
I've got two sources of information ever
what the humans told me and I know
that's 2/3 one six one six because math
and I've learned from experience so far
that all actions are equally likely
which is pretty non-committal it is
pretty non-committal in fact it might be
what happens when you start off if you
had to choose an action in this case
which action would you choose x y ou is
it or is that the quiz no that's a
question oh it's Y oh wow I had no idea
why it would be Y um explain to me why
you chose X sorry oh oh I see
why I chose X because well according to
the algorithm it doesn't really care it
doesn't have any reason to believe one
over the other
but the human has reason to believe it I
guess there's one missing parameter
maybe which is how much we should
believe the human and so if we believe
the human not at all it's still not bad
to use to go for X ah but here's the
thing
we actually have that parameter because
that was C that was C and in fact it
doesn't matter what C is because that's
all inside this distribution this
distribution 2/3 1/6 1/6 actually
already incorporates all the information
about the uncertainty of the human I
don't think it does yeah absolutely does
the probability that X is optimal is in
fact a function of the data that the
human has given us and how likely they
are to be correct in the data that
they've given us but that could it seems
like it could change over time as we as
we've come to believe the algorithm more
then we should believe the human less
you know it's really interesting you say
that because all the other to the
various techniques that have been out
there in the world actually do that they
actually try to capture what the human
has said and what you've learned in the
world and then over time believe the
human less and less often because
whatever the world world is telling you
has got to be correct what's actually
beautiful about this particular
mechanism that we described in the last
couple of slides is that that parameter
C that confidence that we have that
probability that human is correct
actually sort of captures everything we
need to know if we are completely
certain about the human then these
numbers will reflect that by peeking
over whatever actions should be optimal
and if we're uncertain about the human
then these things will tend to stay
towards the uniform</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
