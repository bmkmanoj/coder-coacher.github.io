to use we're going to have features that
we've computed these are things like
Bollinger Bands and momentum and price
change and things like that we're going
to use these features to try and predict
prices or price changes so this is our X
data and if we've got multiple features
we've got multiple dimensions in X so
this might be X 1 X 2 X 3 and so on and
this is our Y data which we're trying to
predict in order to evaluate our
learning algorithms in a scientific
manner we need to split this data into
at least two sections a training section
and a testing section if we trained over
the same data that we test it over the
results would be suspicious because we
should obviously be able to do very well
if we test over the same data we train
on this procedure of separating testing
and training data from one another is
called out-of-sample testing this is a
very important and essential technique
we'll call the X data that we use for
training X train and the Y data that we
use for training Y train similarly the
data will test on will be split into x
and y sections X test and Y test so the
general idea here is it will take our X
train data and our Y train data run that
through our machine learning algorithm
which might be linear regression or KNN
to generate a model we can then test the
accuracy of that model using this data
so the input to the model is X test so
we've plugged that X data into the model
and out comes something some kind of Y
and the question is is that y equal to
this Y which we know is ground truth so
the more closely the model outputs a Y
that reflects this X test data the more
accurate the model is something that I
didn't mention
is that in this class our data is time
oriented so as we move downward we're
going forward in time so we typically
split the data up according to time so
we train our model on older data and
test it on newer data it's generally
frowned upon to do the reverse you might
argue well this data is different than
that data it's still out-of-sample but
there are certain look-ahead biases that
can occur if you were to train on later
data and test on earlier data</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
