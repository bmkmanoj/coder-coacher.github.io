of nodes let's say we have four of them
and connect the first one with the
second one the second one with the third
one third one with the fourth one and
the last one the first one and then we
have trivially a no Alerian tour through
this graph and here's my code to do what
I just described I wanted to create a
graph that was a little bit more fun but
still had an oil area and tour here's
another version that introduces a little
bit of randomness let's say we start off
with eight nodes in the first step I
picked two random nodes and connect them
and choose a random node amongst the
nodes that are connected say this one
and connect them and repeat this process
until all the nodes are connected then
classify all the nodes as being odd or
even all the nodes and orange have odd
degree and the other two nodes are even
we then pick a node in the set of nodes
with odd degree say this one and then
connect it with another node that has
odd degree so we'll connect it to that
one these both now have even degree we
create this process pick this node
connect it with that node now we have
two nodes left that have odd degree
unfortunately they're already connected
what we can do is pick one of the nodes
with odd degree and then randomly pick
another node with even degree that's not
already connected to and connect them so
maybe this one down here now this new
node has odd degree the old node no
longer does now we have two nodes with
odd degree that we can connect just a
fare of a that there's an or laying tour
we can go through here over to here
connecting up with this guy in there and
here's my code that does what I just
described in the first step we pick to
write two random notes and add them to
the graph and while we still have
unconnected notes we continue connecting
everything and then while we still have
odd nodes we continue connecting the odd
nodes one question I'd like to think
about an answer on the forums is whether
this loop is guaranteed to end and if so
why there's a link below in the
instructors comments where I'd like you
to post your answer and read what some
other people have to say as well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
