linear programs in their standard form
where the constraints are expressed as
equality's we will have an
underdetermined system of equations that
has lots of solutions and we'll try to
find the one that maximizes the
objective function now if you've ever
had to come up with solution to an
underdetermined system on your own you
will have noticed that it's easiest to
find one by simply setting some of the
coefficients to 0 so as to create a
square system and then solving for the
rest of the coefficients in fact this is
what solvers like MATLAB do as well
these solutions are called basic
solutions and it turns out that to solve
linear programs basic solutions are the
only ones that we will need to consider
the trick however is figuring out which
coefficients need to be set to 0 with
that intuition in mind let's dive into
the details switching over now entirely
to considering linear programs in
standard form I want to define some
vocabulary that will be useful going
forward first we say that a vector X is
a solution if and only if ax is equal to
B a basic solution is one generated as
follows we'll pick an increasing
sequence of M column numbers so that the
corresponding columns are linearly
independent and we'll call the resulting
matrix B this is easiest to see when the
chosen columns are the first M and we'll
use this convention for most of our
treatment we define X B to be B inverse
times this B here and then embed this in
a longer vector X putting the value from
xB for columns in the sequence and 0
otherwise this X is a basic solution
really all that we're trying to
accomplish here
is to let X be get multiplied with the
columns of B and 0 to get multiplied
with the columns of D remember that post
multiplication corresponds to column
operations so that then is a basic
solution and we call it basic because it
came from our choice of this linearly
independent
of columns which forms a basis for the
column space from this basis we get a
basic solution it is possible for more
than one basis to yield the same basic
solution if some of the entries of this
xB are 0 such a solution is called
degenerate this corresponds to the case
where our vertex is at the intersection
of more than n hyperplanes in the
symmetric form so far this vocabulary
only addresses the Equality constraints
adding in the non negativity constraints
in the variables we use the word
feasible
thus a feasible solution is a solution
that has all non-negative entries and a
basic feasible solution is one that
comes from a basis as described above
and has all non-negative entries</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
