have another creative application of
some concepts you've learned we're going
to deal with a three body problem let's
say that we have three stars one with a
small mass one with twice the small
stars mass and one very large star with
three times this mass given a certain
initial 3d configuration of these stars
we want you to figure out how their
position and velocity change with time
one piece of information that's going to
be very important is this equation of
the gravitational force between two
bodies which you should remember from
our earlier units to remind us that this
force is actually a vector quantity I'm
going to be super explicit and put a
vector sign on top of this remember all
three of these bodies exert a force on
one another in the code you can see that
we've written out the mass of each star
for you as well as the gravitational
constant big G we've dealt with
everything concerning time for you and
all that's left for you to do is to
implement the symplectic Euler method
for the motion of the stars with the
data provided above remember the
symplectic Euler method is kind of half
implicit half explicit method it will
help you find the position and velocity
of each star just so your results don't
surprise you this is a chaotic system so
you should get some pretty interesting
looking graphs</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
