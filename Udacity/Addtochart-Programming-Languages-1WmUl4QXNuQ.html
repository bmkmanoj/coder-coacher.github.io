due to j early a computer scientist and
psychologist and now that we've seen all
the theory behind it we're going to coat
it up in Python together now one of the
tricks that's different between this and
memo fib oh is that our chart may have
many things in it one of the differences
between this chart based algorithm and
our memorized Fibonacci is that our
charts hold groups lists sets of items
after we've seen one token of input
there's an entire collection of par
states that we could be in so we're
going to represent that by having our
chart be a dictionary that map's from
numbers to lists but we're going to use
those lists we don't really want any
duplicates just like we saw with memo
fibo we want to keep adding things to
the chart until we're done we want to be
lazy and not do any extra work so I
don't want to add any duplicate entries
to the chart because that'll just be
more work for me to do later and it may
not settle down so i'm going to write a
special add procedure treating the
right-hand side of the chart as if it
were a set and you may have seen sets in
mathematics but if you haven't a list
can have elements repeated i can have
this list 1 2 2 3 but in a set each
element can occur at most once so if i
were to put 1 to 2 and 3 into this set i
would just get one two and three as the
final result when you're about to put
something in you check and see if it's
already there and if it's already there
you don't do anything I'm going to have
you implement that set for me what I'd
like you to do is write a Python
procedure using the interpreter called
add to chart that takes three arguments
the chart a Python dictionary the index
a number and the state more on that
later but it could be anything and it
ensures that if I go look at chart index
later it will return a list it will
evaluate to a list that contains state
exactly once so if state was already in
chart sub-index don't do anything if it
wasn't you
want to add it add to chart should
return true if something was actually
added should chart sub-index and return
false otherwise false if it was already
there we're going to use this so that we
can tell if we actually updated the
chart and then if we didn't update the
chart maybe we're closer to being done
to simplify this problem bit you can
assume that chart sub index is valid
that index is already in this mapping
and that it returns a list let's say
it's the empty list if we haven't gotten
started yet but it's at least going to
be a list go forth</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
