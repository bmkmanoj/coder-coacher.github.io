there are there are there any downsides
or where are you as far as implementing
this in your company so we haven't
implemented it everywhere yet we're
using it right now almost exclusively
for generating forecasters and although
we've started using it in some newer
applications for similar variants we're
not generating whole applications with
it yet we're generating mostly
components of applications so there's a
lot of opportunity there to to to expand
its use and we're looking into that also
I think I mentioned that this this whole
approach is based on a lot of prior work
in particular it's based on the work on
these layered assemblies like the gin
vodka approach and they had approached
all the work of David Parnis down
Vittori that work is quite rich and so
we've been able to borrow heavily from
it to get layer blocks to where it is
right now but that work also that prior
work also has has gone on beyond what
we've done so there are some pretty nice
things you can do in some of the toys
latest latest work where you can
actually think about generating product
lines of product families which if you
could imagine it would scale much larger
to to building whole applications we
don't have any support for that yet in
layer blocks but that's something we're
looking into so let me let me get a
little clarification here you use the
term product line and product families
can you differentiate those two probably
the best is to give an example so the
what we've looked at so far is how to
use layer blocks to generate different
forecasters different variants of a
forecaster but a forecaster is one kind
of product often what you find and what
we have to deliver to to customers is a
family of related projects such as a
forecaster that works together with a
replenishment system that works together
with the promotion planning system and
what you really would like to do to
scale this up is to be able to generate
product lines of entire product families
and that work is that there is existing
research in that area
but but we have not incorporated that
yet into into layer blocks so there's
this family of compilers called GCC that
are capable of targeting various
platforms but all but also they can be
used for different the technology can be
used for different programming languages
okay is that related to this product
lines and product families interesting
question yeah I guess you could say that
I wouldn't think of a compiler as a
product family but to the extent that it
is not for a single language but for
multiple languages like GCC can be used
for fortran and for a right yeah i think
that's that's that's a that's probably a
good way of thinking about it right and
anything else you'd like to say about
the current status of layer blocks or
things you'd like to do in the future
we're interested in integrating layer
blocks itself and this method of
composition more tightly into the the
programming language that we use to
build our applications right now layer
box is a separate generator but
historically this kind of approach has
almost always led to started that way
started with a separate generator but
then led into very tight integration
into a programming language and I think
that's that's probably this belongs that
will then let us do much more
sophisticated analyses of type
correctness of these assemblies it'll
help us make some better decisions you
mentioned the generality versus
performance problem which could at some
point crop of I have no doubt that
eventually it might by integrating this
more tightly under the programming
language you get more opportunities for
for having more context when you do in
generation is just anything like the the
generic capability in Java where you can
generate collection classes of various
types by parameterizing them it's very
similar yeah so these in fact that tends
to be that kind of method the use of
templates and that our support in the
programming languages is often ways that
this general model gets tightly
integrated into a
which so there was some work Jana
smarticus did some work on integrating
this very cut this very approach into
Java and in exactly the way you just
suggesting so yes and we will put on the
class resources page some links to some
of the some of the papers that Kurt is
referring to in case you want to look
into them a little bit more deeply</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
