let's do this right
hi I'm Charles Isbell true I'm a
professor at Georgia Tech true this is
Michael Lippmann true he is also a
professor at Georgia Tech false no
that's actually true while you're a
professor at Brown you're also an
adjunct professor here at Georgia Tech
I'm a professional doughnut thief false
that is correct I am NOT a professional
together we were teaching the course
machine learning trip the lectures will
only be available on prime numbered
calendar days false the mini course is
on supervised learning true supervised
learning itself was invented in the
1830s by Gauss boss actually I don't
really know it sounds like the sort of
thing of the event but probably not so
let's go with that okay
supervised learning is the problem of
learning to map inputs to predictions of
true or false false good one it also
includes other kinds of predictions such
as requesting where the output might be
vectors or numbers true it's an
important component of all sorts of
technologies from stopping credit card
fraud true to finding faces and camera
images sure to making taste your breath
mints boss I had no idea but that sounds
ridiculous so let's say false to
recognizing spoken language trick our
goal here is to give you the skills that
you need to recognize how to apply these
technologies true and for interpreting
their output so that you can solve a
range of data science problems true and
for surviving a robot uprising false no
that is absolutely true
the most important things you get out of
this course is learning how to survive
the upcoming robot uprising ok very good
you got an accuracy of 85% true
wrong though after you answer this
question you will have an accuracy of
85% true that is correct but false also
we've been correct congratulations</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
