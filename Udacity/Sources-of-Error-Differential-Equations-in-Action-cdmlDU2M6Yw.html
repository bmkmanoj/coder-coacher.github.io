apply optimization in real life we have
to have an idea about the sauces and the
amounts of errors that we are
introducing the model as such may not be
good enough for instance we may be
missing some vital effects and that
model the values that were using for the
models parameters may be wrong we may be
using the wrong growth rate or you may
be using a growth rate that's too big or
we may be using a maximum carrying
capacity that's too large the initial
data may be off do we really know the
amount of fish you're starting with and
you may have numerical issues may be due
to round off errors or maybe which is
more probable due to find out step sizes
we looked at numerix in units two and
three discuss the problems with this
model at the end of this unit what I
want to consider now is how to study
arrows concerning the parameters and
initial data a nice thing about these is
that we can check them in the model we
can use the computer to get an idea
about the effects at least of arrows we
are introducing here and the computer
can help us to find out which of these
parameters and initial data is the most
critical concerning its range of
uncertainty if we tried to get more
certain data which of these would we try
to improve that's one of the major
objectives of sensitivity analysis</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
