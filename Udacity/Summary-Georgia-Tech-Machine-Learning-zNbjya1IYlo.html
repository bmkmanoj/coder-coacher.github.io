talking about vc-dimension so Charles
what do we learn well we learned about
vc-dimension I think that was probably
the key thing indeed which was capturing
this notion of shattering right
we learned that vc-dimension the
relationship between VC dimensions VC
dimension and parameters yeah very good
and in fact so like we'd even be able to
have a guess to say well what if you
have a neural network and you're
thinking of adding additional nodes to
the hidden layer what do we suppose that
would do to the VC dimension of what you
can represent so we didn't really talk
about it but it does occur to me when
you put it that way that it's pretty
subtle right because it's the it's not
just that it's related to the number of
parameters it's related to the true
number of parameters because you can
always come up with inefficient ways to
represent your parameters so for example
if you have a real number I could
represent that as two parameters
everything to the left of the decimal
point and everything to the right of the
decimal point but that doesn't make it
really two separate parameters so it's
still just one parameter all right
that's fair we also saw how VC relates
to the size of the hypothesis space for
finite hypothesis spaces and I guess we
learned how sample complexity relates to
VC dimension and in fact all these
things are themselves related and we
learned a little bit some tricks or at
least went through some examples of how
to actually compute the VC dimension in
particular we learned that you need to
give an example to find the lower bound
and you need to prove an upper Venom
good and one of the things that I'd want
to add to that is that VC dimension
captures this notion of pac learnability
cool I think that's enough for one
session right see you next time Michael
bye all right see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
