encounter and I'm taking in the matrix
here now when I first want to account
for is the none so if my matrix is equal
to none or if it is equal to the empty
matrix
and in this case I just want to return
to you over anyway now if it's this is
not the case I'm just gonna initialize
my islands variable to 0 which is the
number of violence and I'm going to want
to do two for loops to look through this
so I want to know the number of rows and
columns
this is actually going to be vice versa
okay so I'm going to write my for loop
now when I get here I want to check if
the element is equal to one
and if it is I'm going to increment my
islands count so now what I need to do
here is I need to do the breadth-first
search so i was talking about before so
i'm just going to have a helper method
to do that
call it fine parts of Island
so I'm going to go ahead and define that
down here
so the first thing I want to do is I
want to initialize a queue okay since
we're using a breadth-first search here
i want to be able to use a queue so that
i could get the first element in the
when i when i added an element to the
queue i want to be able to get the first
element that I added yeah perfect
and I actually need to import this
method here and this is from the
collections framework
and then the first thing I'm gonna do is
I'm going to append my indexes here so I
know the location so I'm gonna have
handy see my cue
and now just doing the breadth-first
search here so while it's empty I'm
going to keep searching for other things
around so all the length of the queue
so while the length of the queue does
not
so what I want to do here is I want to
look at the elements around it so we
mentioned before that I needed to check
if they were actually there so I'm gonna
write a helper method to do that too
okay so now that I'm checking if this is
empty I want to do something with this
element here but it looks like I'm
running out of space I'm just going to
draw a little arrow over here and just
got this little section off here that
I'm going to be using to finish this
method here so what I want to do is I
want to be able to get this element here
from let me make sure to go up a little
bit higher so on a pop this element off
the cue
I don't want to be able to access these
two variables so I'm just going to set
them to a new one
okay so now that I'm here I want to
check if this element is equal to one
and if it is I want to set it to two as
I mentioned before
so I'm going to use a helper method
right here to check if these elements
that are next to it actually next to it
and then if they are I'm going to add it
to the queue so I'm gonna call that wash
face here
so this methods gonna call it be called
append if and I'm passing in the queue
and I also need the row column and both
of these coordinates you okay so what I
want to check here is if the x value is
greater than or equal to zero
or I mean not or and it is less than the
number of columns and if Y is greater
than or equal to zero and if Y is less
than the number of rows and then if all
those conditions hold true what I'm
going to want to do is append this thank
you
perhaps colons there and so I'm going to
want to append this file here and just
to make sure I'm appending it the right
way so I access the first element so
that's how my helper method is going to
work so after I do all of that there a
method here I'm running out of space
right here so all this information here
is just basically I'm calling this
method on all the elements around it so
you're going to append if that's what I
need to do is pass it to cue rows
columns and what I'm gonna do is X plus
1 and Y so it's going to be the elements
to the right of it and then this is
going to be the element below it
two left
and on top that looks like it well that
went pretty smoothly
yes it did after going through all the
necessary steps before coding the
solution the actual coding is a lot
easier than if he were to have just
jumped in and coded from the beginning
the interviewee also made sure to let
the interviewer know what he was doing
when he was coding but he didn't read
out all of his code as he was coding we
often see interviewees just reading out
their code as they code which can get
annoying and does not really build
understanding with the interviewer yep
this interview we focused more on
explaining the purpose of the code while
he was writing by talking out loud you
give your interviewer the chance to jump
in and help if your logic is wrong you
also prove to your interviewer that
you're actually thinking through all of
your code if you just write code you
might be spitting out a memorized answer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
