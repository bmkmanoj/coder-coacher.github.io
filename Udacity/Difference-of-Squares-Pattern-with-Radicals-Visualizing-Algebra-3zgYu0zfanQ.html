one negative 3 for the second one and
negative 51 for the third one great work
if you found all three of those now if
you weren't quite sure what to do that's
okay let's see how it's done for the
first problem we know that the a value
is really equal to 3 so we're going to
square this three hour B value is really
square root of six so we'll square the
square root of 63 squared equals 9 and
the square root of 6 squared equals 6
then we just subtract these two numbers
to get positive 3 for our second problem
the a value is really equal to the
square root of two and our B value is
really cool to the square root of 5
squaring this square root leaves us with
two and squaring this square root leaves
us with five so 2 minus 5 equals
negative 3 and this last difference of
squares will have a is to root of 3 and
B is 3 root of 7 and here's we want to
be careful we want to square this too
and the square root of three we know 2
squared is 4 and the square root of 3
squared is 3 there's multiplication
between this number and this radical so
after we square there's still
multiplication between this number and
this number we square 3 root 7 to get
nine times seven next we multiply 4
times 3 to get 12 and nine times seven
to get 63 and then subtract to get our
final answer of negative 51 now I think
that's pretty incredible that we can
take something that contains radicals
and pop out just one number</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
