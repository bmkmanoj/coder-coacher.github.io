guys can build just about anything you
can collect data from users you can
build pretty web pages you can store all
this stuff in databases you can
manipulate this database you can build
logins all sorts of cool things and when
you think about it just about every
website on the internet is some
combination of the things you've already
learned how to do so it's pretty cool
that you can you've gotten this far now
one of the things we haven't touched on
yet is how to build websites that
operate at a larger scale that is that
more than just a couple of people can
use when you start having websites
operating at a big scale lots of things
can break down you can run out of disk
space for your data you can run out of
bandwidth to serve all of the amazing
stuff that you have or you can run out
of you know processor time to actually
generate all the amazing computations
you're doing right there's all sorts of
different things that can that are
limiting factors and how your website
functions and we're going to learn how
to address each of those things how to
use multiple machines if you need to and
that sort of thing so I can actually
build a large-scale website so let's
jump right in</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
