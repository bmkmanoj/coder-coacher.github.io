about these age distributions which is
these funds are clustered very close to
18 whereas these all over the place
really far from 18 in most cases so can
be characterized as somehow I would say
the mode the median or the mean don't
really capture the spread of the data
what does capture the spread is called
the variance so now we compute the
variance of the data and the very first
trick we apply is we normalize these
sequences by subtracting the mean from
each data item so in the case of the
friends if you subtract 18 from 17 we
get minus 1 1 0 minus 1 1 if we subtract
18 from this data sequence we get minus
11 20 minus 14 5 and 0 if you compute
the mean of these two sequences then you
find the mean in both cases is 0 and I
spare you the work and the reason is by
subtracting the mean from every single
data item we took it out of the equation
and we arrive at 0 but what's now really
interesting is that these numbers are
much closer to 0 and these numbers over
here so the spread over here is much
larger now you might think in computing
the variance you just add up all these
values and you get a measure of the
spread but the truth is it doesn't work
if you add them up they're actually 0 so
we have to add up something else and
what's commonly added up are the squares
of those values the squares here are 1 1
0 1 1 whereas over here
they're 121 400 under 96 25 and 0 so for
the variance we sum the squares of all
these numbers and normalize that but the
squares are not taking of the original
data they're taken of the original data
minus the mean which I'm going to write
by this Greek letter over here mu so do
me a favor and try to compute the
variance for the first sequence which
you obtain by adding those squares over
here and dividing them
