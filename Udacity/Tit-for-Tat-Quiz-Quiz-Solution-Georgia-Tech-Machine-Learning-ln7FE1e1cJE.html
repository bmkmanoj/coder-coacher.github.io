can tell me what happens when tit for
tat plays against always cooperate so
what happens if you always cooperate
well let's see I start out cooperating
and since the other person is
cooperating I will continue to cooperate
because that's what they did the last
time so I will always cooperate that's
right
good all right so what about if we play
against always defect well if we always
defect the first time I'm going to
cooperate because that's what you said
tit for tat is but from that point on I
will do what my opponent does which is
defect so I will cooperate and then
defect defect defect defect defect
defect ellipsis yeah so I put this
always defect in there but actually it
can't ever be the right answer
right because tit for tat always starts
off cooperating so the other three seem
like they might be possible always
defect is not possible good all right so
what if tit for tat plays against
another tit for tat well I started out
cooperating my opponent cooperated and
since I'm gonna do what that person does
I will cooperate but since that person
is doing what I did they will also
cooperate and so we will both cooperate
forever so we will always cooperate nice
so isn't that kind of interesting so tit
for tat even though if when it's playing
against itself is a very cooperative
fellow
but if tit for tat is playing against
something that defects it becomes a
little bit more vengeful yes all right
so what if it plays against something
that is a little unsure of itself so it
starts off defecting then cooperating
then defecting that it's sort of it
almost an anti kind of thing right so
it's this is one that starts off with a
defect right so in also our first thing
I do is cooperate and then after that
effectively I do what the opponent does
one step before so I basically take what
you I'm pointing to the screen you can't
see me I take the the DC DC D and I just
put a C in front of it because that's
what I'm gonna do
so I will do CD CD CD CD ellipsis so
that's your last choice isn't the CD CD
CD ellipsis in Atlanta it is actually it
is the home of all such analysis of
diseases in the United States the Center
for Disease Control that's exactly what
it is come to Atlanta and work for us
all right so good so that's that's the
pattern of responses that tit-for-tat
makes against this set of strategies
yeah so we answered my question</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
