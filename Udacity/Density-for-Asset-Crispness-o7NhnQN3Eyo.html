older app on a nice new device sometimes
icons look really really blurry in these
cases the app most likely used a low
resolution asset for a UI element that
was given a larger size an easy first
step to improving an app is to make sure
it has high resolution assets like this
one much better right
while you should generally provide
assets for all these major density
buckets
it's normally okay to just include xhdpi
or xxhdpi assets and let Android scale
them down or down sample them it's not
ideal but if you add to pick one provide
the higher density assets and not just
the lower ones
however down sampling has risks there's
a minor performance hit when Android has
to do scaling for you on the fly
additionally androids down sampling
algorithm is really optimized for speed
not perfect scaling it doesn't look
great at all if you have to down sample
from a very large sixteen by sixteen
hundred pixel graphic to a small 200 by
200 pixel space the good news is there
are lots of great tools out there for
automatically creating graphics for all
the major density buckets when you're
creating your app one example that's
useful for icons is the Android asset
