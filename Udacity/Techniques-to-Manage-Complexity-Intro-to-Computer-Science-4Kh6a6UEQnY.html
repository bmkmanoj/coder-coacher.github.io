classes as we build larger and more
complex programs we quickly end up with
programs that are far too big for one
person to keep in their head at any one
time one solution of this would be to
have your head explode this only works
once instead what we need our techniques
to manage complexity and that's going to
be the focus of this unit as well as
some of the things we cover in later
lessons this is one of the main things
that distinguishes experienced
programmers from beginners is this
ability to manage complexity to deal
with larger and larger programs and the
biggest idea for that is actually
modularity unlike exploding heads
breaking up programs into pieces is
actually a good thing in this unit we'll
look at two mechanisms that Python
provides to help programmers break
things up into pieces in a way that
doesn't make your head explode the first
is modules and the second is classes by
using these ideas well you'll be able to
construct large and complex programs
without your head blowing up into pieces</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
