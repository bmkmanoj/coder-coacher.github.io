distribution platform the first thing
that people will notice is your game
icon and name let's focus on the name
first choosing your name strategically
effects where your game appears in
search results and can help you stand
out from your competitors here are a few
tips to consider when you're thinking of
a name keep it short and simple make it
descriptive and make it unique which
will make it easy to search for each app
store has a maximum app named length
before it cuts off and turns into
ellipses as you can see in this example
Angry Birds Star Wars and Kingdom rush
frontier are cut off so make sure to
keep your name short enough to make it
visible especially the parts of the
names that are descriptive having a
descriptive name is really important
because then when someone browses the
app store they'll have an idea of what
your game is about right when they see
it here the names stack the states and
table top racing give us an idea of what
to expect in the game even if we've
never heard of them before a stacking
game and a racing game you also want to
have a searchable game name one that
sets itself apart from any similar apps
if you don't you might end up with too
much competition like in the case of
names that involve flappy in their title
after the success of flappy bird so many
other flappy apps popped up that it was
hard to tell one from the other so
choose a unique descriptive and short
game name</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
