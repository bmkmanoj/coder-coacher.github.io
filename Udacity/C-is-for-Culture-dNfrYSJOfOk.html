letter stands for culture what does that
mean huge inspiration for DevOps was
agile and one of a JAL's key points is
people over process over tools you can
have the most efficient product
development operations and marketing
teams in the world but if they do not
communicate there's no feedback or
collaboration between teams it can lead
to huge waste of time and resources lien
is also a major inspiration for DevOps
culture lean is centered on streamlining
operations reducing waste with the end
goal of maximizing customer value
improving separate points in the
production pipeline is not enough you
have to improve the whole flow ever hear
the phrase hurry up and wait it reminds
me of traveling on international flights
having a faster silo doesn't really help
in getting me to the plane quicker I
usually just end up waiting in the next
line this is also true for DevOps if we
focus on our customers as the main goal
it becomes an easy common ground for all
concerned parties a great culture is
also important fostering respect you can
also call it hug ups when you can
understand and you can empathize on both
dev and ops teams you can really focus
your energies on positive outcomes
usually known as going to work thinking
how can we make this harder but there
are various reasons as to why it happens</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
