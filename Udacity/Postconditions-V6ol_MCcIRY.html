postconditions one having to do with the
new link in the association and the
other one having to do with updating
contingently updating the request lists
in so we'll consider the first post
condition here what we're really saying
is that there's going to be a new check
out record another way of saying that is
there must exist a new check out record
and in fact there's a keyword in OC l
called exists and so the postcondition
here is going to say there's going to
exists and this is just like in our
first order logic where we had the
leftward facing capital letter e that
there's a bound variable this case we'll
call it C so there's a new link in that
association the association's name
checked out okay with the properties
that the that links loanable item had
better be the item we're checking out
which was the argument to the operation
okay and the properties that we wish to
hold about that check out that is the
due date okay had better be correct and
to get the due date we can go get
today's date and then we can add in the
checkout period and remember we have the
checkout period that was one of the
first requirements we dealt with an OC l
and we can go get that check out period
by navigating from the check out link to
the corresponding loanable item and then
getting its checkout period okay and the
third so that that says there must exist
this new item and it also better be the
case that the checked out Association
itself must have a new item in it and
the way we do that in either first or
logic or you know CL is to make a
statement of equality between the state
that existed before the checkout
operation and the state that existed
afterwards so the state that exists
afterwards is just checked out we can
think of that as a set of record
or a set of links the but we need some
special notation to deal with the state
of the checked out Association
beforehand and ocl has a keyword call
it's indicated by the @ sign followed by
the word pre so this is saying check out
at pre means the version before we call
the operation and check out by itself
means the version afterwards and there
is an operation on sets and checked out
is a set it's a set of links okay that
allows us to indicate that another
element is associated with that
particular set and that keyword is
including so it's as if we are
constructing a new set which is the old
set plus this one new item actually this
one new checked out link which we've
given the the name see so we have the
checked out afterwards is equal to the
checked out before and this one other
item which we've just added and that's
what's being expressed on the on the
bottom line there so we're making use of
some special keywords and operations in
the ocl language to express the quality
of these two states so I've got a quick
question can we also consider the at pre
including kind of be like set Union so
we're Union the set of all of our
checked out associations plus this new
checked out Association almost ok but
this item this new I'm sorry this new
checked out link is not a set it's just
an element so right okay if if we had
somehow been able to wrap it in some set
thing then it would be uniting this Noma
and and what what I think jared is
pointing out here is that we have to be
careful in getting the data types right
in these things so asset is diff
in an element and if you had a union
operation you couldn't put an element on
it and if you had including you couldn't
put a set on it so that was the first
post condition having to do updating the
checked out Association the second one
had to do with the requests the list of
requests that were made and we had a
precondition that said that if there are
requests there it better be the case
that the jared is the person doing the
requesting so now we need to update that
request list if if it exists and and
with with the fact that we want to take
jared off that list we don't want him to
hog the book too long so in this case
the postcondition is going to make use
of another feature of ocl called the let
expression and the let expression is
just an abbreviation it allows us to
state in one place and expression and
then use it in several places so in this
case we're saying let the new variable T
of type title be that title of the
current item recall that we distinguish
between items which are things that
could be checked out from the things
that could be requested which we call
titles but an item always has a title
that's the composition operator that we
see in the diagram and we just want to
use the shorthand of t4 item title to
save ourselves you know a few characters
every time we type so the let expression
there defines the new symbol and binds
it during the the scope of another
expression which is the post condition
and the postcondition here is a
conditional as we expected so if that
particular title has a request to this
particular patron and then we want to
update the request association
so the antecedent of the conditional is
te request patron and if we didn't have
tea we'd have i dot title dot request
that patron then be either three or four
steps in the chain of qualified name and
includes is a operation on that set of
requests and self is the ocl keyword
corresponding to the instance of the
particular class and remember that was
way back with patron so we're seeing
whether or not jared is in the list of
people doing the requesting and if so we
want to do another one of these
statements of equality between the state
before and the state afterwards so the
state afterwards is the request
Association and the state before is
requests at pre and in this case it's
not that we're adding in a new record
it's we want to remove it but it's a
statement of equality so we're we're
stating that by saying if we in the
keyword in you know CL is reject ok if
we reject that particular those
particular items in the list which have
the following boolean and the boolean is
the title is T and the patron itself ok
then we have a version of the request
association without that one record in
it and that had better equal to the one
afterwards if there were no requests
with with Jared at the top of the list
then our result is true ok so we don't
have to be concerned there so the
overall the overall postcondition
constraint has the form of the let
binding and then within that a
conditional and the conditional we're
only interested in the then part of it
in which is qualified by whether or not
jared has done the requesting and in
which case we want to ensure that a
Jared's request is no longer in in that
particular association so do you have a
recommendation it seems like our on this
if then statement because this if-then
statement the L
is kind of a vacuously true situation so
wouldn't it just be better to use an
imply statement to save yourself some
writing good good point so yeah we could
we could we can improve shorten the
situation by doing the implies I had one
other question if that's all right so to
me I guess are all associations that are
modeled in our um diagram can they be
thought of when we're expressing things
in OC l assets because it seems like we
express t dot request patron this is an
association we're talking about the
patron part of the association this the
set of all patrons that have requested
things are the and which a request
instance is there is model net set okay
so you can think of them as sets but
sometimes we can do a little bit better
so recall that in UML those the ability
to order things and order things then we
get sequences okay so sequences give us
a little more power because we can index
into them of course what sets you can't
index into them right so now a sequence
is a set but sequence because it has
this this ordering with it allows us a
little more power and that's going to be
based on the model that we have whether
it be modeled it that way or as I said
that the property is the requirements
and whether we modeled it that way okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
