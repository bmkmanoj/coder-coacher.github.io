crawl for a birthday party with a friend
it's 2009 it was still just really cool
to see your own name and a smartphone so
it had a little picker view inside it
when he shipped the phone the pic of you
would cycle through everybody who was
there and kind of randomly stopped and I
put a little button in the corner so
that you could put your thumb over it
and shake it I mean it would if you're
holding it right then it would come up
with the birthday boy whoever's name
came up had to drink so you know in the
end we could set him up it's good fun
the first time I ever adult well I
actually started before there was an SDK
so um in 2007 when the iphone came out
there was a pretty good jailbreak
community and we were sort of swizzle in
all the api's and i had been an audio
developer on OS 10 for years so i ported
one of my commercial apps to iOS and it
was just super exciting because this was
basically a full desktop operating
system on a mobile device so the first
app was called I'd Roman we actually did
23 of them with a different music
artists and whatnot and it was it was
really exciting we had two of them
available the day the app store opened
because we had a pretty good running
start so the first step that I built was
called Adam and it stood for the Alpha
Tau Omega mobile application I built for
my fraternity in college and as
fraternity brothers we were looking for
a way to communicate and broadcast
messages privately in a way that was
kind of like Twitter so that's what we
did instead of you know carrier pigeon
or email or anything like that we use
this atom map to communicate</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
