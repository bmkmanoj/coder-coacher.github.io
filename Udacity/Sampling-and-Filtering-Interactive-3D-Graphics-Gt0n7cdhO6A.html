settings for magnification minification
and an isotropy the minimal settings are
listed first the higher quality ones
further down quality does cost more GPU
processing time so you have to decide
what settings you can justify the norm
nowadays is to have linear magnification
and the best quality mipmap filtering on
I should note that anisotropic sampling
does not exist on older GPUs there was
an extension in WebGL each vendor has
its own secret sauce as to how they
implement this algorithm so rendering
quality can vary the maximum and
isotropic sampling rate can also vary
from GPU to GPU calling the get max
anisotropic function gives the maximum
rate possible on the GPU running the
program
this is usually a power of two and
usually no higher than 16 you can set
the value higher if you want 3 J S will
use the highest level available on the
card more samples cost more processing
power so again you need to decide what
rate is reasonable that are yet still
better sampling methods possible and
isotropic filtering is not the ultimate
answer and went into perhaps excessive
detail in this aspect of the GPU but for
a good reason this whole process of
sampling and filtering comes up again
and again throughout all of computer
graphics if you take too many samples
you're wasting time and possibly causing
other problems too few and you can get
artifacts where the samples are taken
and how the samples are combined or
filtered can also make a huge difference
many processes can be thought of in
these terms did i tessellate the surface
enough to capture its essence should my
computation happen the vertex shader or
the fragment shader should my shadow
buffer have a higher resolution or
should I use a different algorithm when
I think of computer graphics and
rendering as a whole I think of it
primarily in terms of sampling and
filtering give the demo a try it will
show you the valid levels for your GPU
if you only see a value one it means
your GPU does not support anisotropic
filtering</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
