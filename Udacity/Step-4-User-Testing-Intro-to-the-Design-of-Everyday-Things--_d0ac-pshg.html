show our designs to three other people
and find out how we as designers can
improve them how do we make it simpler
how can we increase the discoverability
and what are the cues for feedback and
how do we make those stronger for a few
tips see the project brief on how to do
an effective feedback session with users
now let's watch Clifton as he shows his
designs to Kathleen a potential user
notice how he interacts with Kathleen
and in particular notice how he asks her
questions so Kathleen imagine you have
this new product this digital wallet
that you kind of you can trade times
with other people so you start off here
and tell me what you see and what you
would like to do so what would you do
here I would probably type in you know
whatever I'm looking for knowing what
that I have my balance and start start
looking for a person to help me trade or
do whatever I'm looking to do okay so
look let's assume you tap on this you
could at this screen keep going and and
so now I think I would see that these
are all the people who learn near me and
and what costs they have um looks like
they're better in the green red would be
maybe by myself I like that it is
actually something I think it would be
nice if we actually started with the
green in it you showed me the things
that I could afford first rather than
the things that I can't afford because
it seems a little snubbing okay look at
this you can't have it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
