chose this one also and let's say these
two so we double our sample size then
you see we have this small value of 32%
and that's going to drag down the sample
statistic x-bar the average so this will
be closer to the population average mu
and of course ideally we'd want the
entire population but oftentimes that's
really hard to do because the population
might be so big that's when we need a
sample but a bigger sample will better
approximate the population parameter
another example where samples can be
misleading is predicting the outcome of
the presidential election for this last
presidential election with President
Obama versus Mitt Romney a lot of polls
were given out which each came up with
its own result some of them predicted
that Romney was going to win which as we
know didn't happen while each sample may
not perfectly predict population
parameters the sample statistic can give
us an interval in which the population
parameter lies as long as the sample is
random and as unbiased as possible
we'll go more into depth about samples
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
