pretty straightforward quiz I just want
you to use everything that you've
learned so far okay so you have three
hypotheses let's call them H 1 H 2 and H
3
hmm okay for the sake of argument here
is what each of these hypothesis outputs
for some particular X h1 says plus h2
says minus h3 says - okay now here we've
already made it easy for you and we've
computed the probability of a particular
hypothesis given some set of data I'm
not showing you the data but I'm showing
you the answer for it okay so the
probability of h1 given the data is 0.4
h2 is 0.3 and h3 is 0.3 got it
wait hang on so ok I see that
corresponding has given the data what's
X X is some input it doesn't matter just
like it doesn't matter what the data is
just call it so the X is X okay it's
just some object out in the world and
each hypothesis labels it plus or minus
okay or can label it plus or minus and
h1 decides it for that X it's positive
and the other two hypotheses decide that
it is in fact negative and h1 has a
probability that is the maximum a
posterior probability is 0.4 for h2 is
0.3 and for h3 is 0.3 so my question to
you is very simple using all of the
magic that we've done with this is just
a mixer Nate you've got it Michael
because I don't know I've done a lot of
derivations we walked away from some
things I want to make the basic what is
the best label for X is it plus or is it
- I see why this is tricky okay and go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
