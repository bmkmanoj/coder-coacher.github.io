disadvantages of a web application over
a native application and that is a big
question there are a lot of things you
could say about that there are a lot of
potential advantages and disadvantages
if you ask multiple people you might not
come up with the same answers some of
the potential advantages of a web
application are that you don't have to
ship new new versions when you come out
with a new version you can update it on
the fly on your web app on your web
server automatically to all of your
users which is potentially a pretty huge
success there's also portability you
don't have to have versions for windows
for Macintosh for Linux or whatever
you're supporting a lot of people had
issues and there were different issues
for when we were installing Google App
Engine depending on what operating
system they had with a web application
you don't have to worry about that at
least you don't have to worry about it
too much certain browsers have quirks
and handle things a little differently
but for the basics it's fairly browser
agnostic which can be a big win if you
don't want to have to deal with multiple
versions the same software or you simply
don't have the resources to build
multiple versions of the same software
you also have potentially thousands of
computers in a data center somewhere
that your web applications running on
instead of a single computer that your
user is running locally so much easier
to diagnose problems it's much easier to
fix them on the fly it's much more it
it's much quicker to improve your
product in that way and make sure that
your user can receive an improved
experience some of the disadvantages
might be some of the problems associated
with an online application like
performance if you're running a hylian
processor intense 3d game off
web application that might not work so
well because you need to be able to
respond very quickly in potentially
milliseconds the other problem is that
you have to deal with internet
availability in depending on the area
that might not be a problem but some
areas don't have regular internet access
and you would be losing out on users if
you don't take that into consideration</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
