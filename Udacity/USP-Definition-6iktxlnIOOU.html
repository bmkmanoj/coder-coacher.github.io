definition from the definers of the
unified software process I'm not going
to recite it for you but I will mention
several key elements one is architecture
is all about decisions the choices that
the architect makes about how which
components are there how they interact
and how the non-functional requirements
are being dealt with as far as the
components are concerned these are
structural elements and their interfaces
that is what they provide to the rest of
the world and what they require from the
rest of the world components interact
they engage in collaboration with other
components and it is the composition of
these structural and behavioral elements
into larger and larger subsystems that
form the overall architecture this
structuring is this composing may be
guided by architectural styles that
provide guidance as to or bring in
experience that others have had with
building similar systems the decisions
about software architecture is concerned
not only the structure and behavior but
other important elements such as usage
performance comprehensibility
understandability economics technology
constraints and trade-offs and aesthetic
concerns</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
