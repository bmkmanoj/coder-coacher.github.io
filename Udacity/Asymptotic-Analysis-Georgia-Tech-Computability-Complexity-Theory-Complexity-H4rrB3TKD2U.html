write down every running time
function exactly, so computer scientists
use various levels of approximation.
For complexity,
we use asymptotic analysis.
I'm going to do a very
brief review here, but
if you haven't seen this idea before,
you should take a few minutes to study
it on your own before
proceeding with the lesson.
We define big O of a function
F to be the set of functions
G where there are numbers C and
big N such that for all little N,
at least as big as big N,
G of N is at most C times F of N.
In other words,
C times F of N is at least G of N for
all sufficiently large N.
Even though we've
defined big O as a set,
we write g(n) = O (f(n)) instead
of using the inclusion sign.
We also say that G is order F.
This definition can be
a little confusing.
But it should feel like the definition
of a limit from your calculus class.
In fact, we can re-state this
condition to say that the ratio
of G over F converges to
a constant under the lim soup.
An example also, helps.
Take this function, g of n is equal
to n squared minus n plus ten.
We can argue that this is order n
squared, by choosing c is equal to one.
And big N equal to ten.
For every little n greater than ten,
N squared,
this red line here, is bigger than
the function g, the blue line.
We also could have chosen
c equal to ten and
big N equal to one again in that case.
The red line, the c times n squared,
is bigger than the function g,
the blue line.
Note that the big O notation does
not have to create a tight bound.
Thus, g(n) is also order n squared,
setting c equal to 1 and
N equal to 3 works for this.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
