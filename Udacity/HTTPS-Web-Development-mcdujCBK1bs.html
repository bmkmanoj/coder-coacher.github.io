promise last one was the final one but
we got to mention this we know how to
store passwords securely on the server
we still have this issue that if you
type in a password remember how when we
did the forms I showed you that you
could type in a password in a password
text box you know and it looks like
little little circles or little
asterisks and that even when you when
you submit this in the URL you could
still see remember we saw Q equalled
hunter two before when we were playing
around with that submitting a form to go
back to our trusty picture you know if
you're submitting this password to these
servers the password is actually sent in
clear text over the internet so you're
storing the password securely on your
server if your database gets stolen you
know you're covered pretty much but the
problem is when the user logs in they're
actually sending this password and clear
of the internet so if you really really
care about that about having a password
encrypted the whole way so some bad guy
in the middle can't just you know sniff
the password off the wire you use HTTP
and all HTTP is is like HTTP except it's
encrypted over SSL that means this whole
communication is encrypted so this man
in the middle in theory unless he's
hacked Verisign and they'd never get
hacked can't see what's being
transmitted over the wire so it's all
gobbledygook the him so anyway that's
what HTTP is for and if you really are
if you're building something that's
secure you know perhaps not a blog but
you know Gmail for example you want to
be using HTTPS and then you've got
secure transmission from the browser to
the servers and you've got secure
passwords on the servers and you're in a
reasonably good setup</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
