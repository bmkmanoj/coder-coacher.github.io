start making an inventory of concepts
and figure out how to represent them so
we want to represent a person a
collection of people and probably it
looks like we want to have two
collections of people one the collection
of people on the here side and one the
collection of people on the day our side
we also need to represent the light or
the torch and from there it seems like
that's about it and all the other
concepts we need are the concepts we
already have of states and pass now how
about the representation choices for a
person well I hate to reduce people to
numbers but in this case that seems like
the perfect thing to do is that this
person regardless of all his wonderful
individual qualities we can just
represent by the number 5 how about a
collection of people we could represent
the collection as a tuple 1 2 5 10 as a
list as a set there's also this data
type in Python called a frozen set and
what I want you to tell me is of these
four which do you think would be okay
for representations just in terms of
being able to manipulate them and and
calculate the successors and which of
these are hashable and hashable is
important because if we're going to use
the same type of technique we used
before for our search we had our
explored set which was a set of states
and members of a set have to be hashable
so that's a property that we might want
to worry about now i should say one more
thing in that the description of the
problem it was explicitly stated that
each of the people has different speeds
now that bothered me a little bit
because I could certainly imagine two
people having the same speed but let's
just solve what we were asked to solve
where every person has a distinct speed</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
