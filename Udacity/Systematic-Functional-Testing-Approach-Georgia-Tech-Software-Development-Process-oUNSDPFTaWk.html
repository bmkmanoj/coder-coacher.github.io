box testing black box testing start from
a description of the software or as we
call it a functional specification and
the final result of black box testing is
a set of test cases a set of actual
inputs and corresponding outputs that we
can use to exercise our code and to try
to find defects in our code so the
question is how do we get from
functional specification to test cases
doing this derivation so going from this
description to a concrete set of tests
is a very complex analytical process a
normally brute force generation is not a
good idea because it's inefficient and
ineffective what we want to do instead
is to have a systematic approach to
derive test cases from a functional
specification what a systematic approach
does is to simplify the overall problem
by dividing the process into elementary
steps in particularly in this case we'll
perform three main steps the first step
is to identify independently testable
features individual features in the
software that we can test and we're
going to expand on each one of these
steps in the next part of the lesson the
following step is once we have this
independently testable features to
identify what are their relevant inputs
so what are the inputs or the behavior
that is worth testing for these features
next once we have these inputs we want
to derive test case specifications and
test case specifications our description
of the test cases that we can then use
to generate actual test cases and
proceeding in this way
by these steps has many advantages it
allows for decoupling in different
activities it allows for dividing brain
intensive steps from steps that can be
automated is a great advantage and also
as we will see it allows you for
monitoring the testing process so to
figure out whether your testing process
is going as expected for example if
you're generating too many test cases
all you're generating the number of this
cases that your amount of resources
available allows you to run so let's
start by looking at the first step of
this process in which our goal is to go
from a functional specification to a set
of features that we can test in the
software so what we want to do is to
identify all of the features of the
software and why do we want to do this
well you know in the spirit of breaking
down the complexity of the problem it
does not make sense to just try to
devise test cases for all the features
of the software at once for any
non-trivial software that's a humongous
problem and something that we cannot
really handle effectively
much better way is to identify
independently testable features and
consider one of them at a time when
generating tests</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
