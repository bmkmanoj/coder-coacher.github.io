art commands let's look at some more
data this time we'll be looking at data
collected from a survey of reddit users
reddit a social and entertainment
website where users can post links and
comments about trending news this survey
asks users about demographic information
such as gender age nationality and
employment status it even asked users
what type of cheese they would be and
whether they prefer dogs cats or turtles
download the data set from the
instructor notes and load it into our
once you've done that take a look at the
data by using the stir function now when
I try to read in the file sometimes I
might get an error this is pretty common
so I would suggest looking at your
current working directory to figure out
the problem often times your directory
isn't where your file is stored all
right so I've set my directory and now
I'm going to try this code up here again
and there we go there's our data running
the stir command we can see that there's
lots of data here most of these
variables have a type of factor now a
factor is a categorical variable that
has different flavors or levels to it an
example of this would be employment
status this variable has many different
levels such as employed full-time or
employed part-time or not working one
thing we might be interested in is how
many people are in each group of
employment status we can table that
variable to see the number in each of
these groups running this code I can see
the table we can also get these counts
and other data points by running the
summary function on our data frame I
encourage you to check out the output of
this for yourself in addition to factor
variables like employment status the our
programming language also has other data
types like lists and matrices but we
really won't be working with them in
this course we've included a reference
for data types in the instructor notes
so if you'd like to learn more about
those check it out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
