expression module called the re module
and if you really want to use regular
expressions you import RV and get
started but the point here is not so
much to use regular expressions as to
show you what it's like to build a
language processor and so to get started
doing that I started by writing a test
function that defines some regular
expressions using this API so first I
defined a b and c as being these
literals then i combined some more
complicated examples and then I showed
some example of certian so of what we
want to be true so we've defined two
functions that match the functions in
the re module the first function is
called search it takes a pattern and a
text and in the regular certain module
this function returns something called a
match object but we'll have it do is
return a string which will be the
earliest match in the text for the
pattern and if there's more than one
match at the same location that'll be
the longest of those so for example
search for the EF in a b c d e f would
return d EF because it's found their
next function is called match it also
takes a pattern and attacks and returns
the string that matches but for match
the match much must occur at the very
start of the string so search the EF
would return none indicating that
there's no manage but search for d EF in
this string that has d EF at the
beginning would return that match so
here's some examples of the types of
things i want to be able to do and that
gives me the start of a specification
for how i want to write my search and
match functions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
