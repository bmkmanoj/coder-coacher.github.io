written in standard form is to first put
them into slope-intercept form if I had
an equation like this I would want to
change it to slope-intercept form I
would want to get the Y alone so I would
have 3y equals 6 minus 2x and really I
could list the negative 2x first and
slope intercept form that's the case the
X term comes first I can make the switch
here I'd write my equation like this
because of the commutative property of
addition and subtraction 1 plus 2 is the
same as 2 plus 1 likewise positive 6
minus two x is the same thing as
negative 2x plus 6 notice that the sign
stays with the term the 6 is positive
and the 2 X is negative finally we
divide every term by three to get y
equals negative two-thirds X plus 2 now
I can read that the slope is negative
two-thirds pretty great I can also see
the slope by looking at standard form
the slope is going to be equal to the
negative of the value of a divided by
the value of B in this case a is
positive 2 and B is positive 3 so I
substitute 2 for a and 34 be so we get
negative two thirds</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
