being able to develop an answer to
questions like that and it's the notion
of epsilon exhaustion which sounds kind
of tiring I know I'm absolutely
exhausted right now yeah me too so so
what we mean by this is well here's a
definition so a version space of version
space that's derived from a particular
sample is considered epsilon exhausted
if and only if for all the hypotheses
that are in that version space they have
low error right so if we can do this
then your algorithm is going to work
right Charles your algorithm says at
that point choose any of the hypotheses
in your hypothesis set and you're gonna
be fine you're gonna have low error sure
and if you don't do this then your
algorithms gonna be in trouble because
you're gonna uniformly at random choose
one of the hypotheses and it has a
chance of being wrong and it could be a
fairly high chance if there's you know
say there's only two hypotheses left in
the version space one is right and one
has higher and one has low error we
really have to make sure that the only
things left in the version space have
low error okay that makes sense that
make sense all right so we're gonna have
to develop a little bit of theory to
figure out when that occurs but this is
this is a really key concept okay so I
guess if I was trying to put this in
English just make certain I understand
it what you're saying is something is
epsilon exhausted a version space is
epsilon exhausted exactly in the case
when everything that you might possibly
choose has an error less than Epsilon
sure period and so if there's anything
in there that has error greater than
Epsilon then it's not epsilon exhausted
right it's still epsilon energized
right that makes a lot of sense epsilon
energize it that's a pretty good name
for a band okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
