library you'll want to download the
starter project for the app the download
link is posted in the instructor notes
the UI is already built for this app so
we can focus on just the networking
aspects if we run the app we have a
title label at the top and then we have
a button at the bottom that will grab a
new image from Flickr right now if we
tap the button it just disables the UI
and it waits for an image to be loaded
from Flickr back in our storyboard we
can see that there's an image view for
our image as well as a label this photo
title label that we can use to display
any text associated with the image then
in the viewcontroller.swift file we have
a single action grab new image that's
called when the button is pressed in the
action we disable the UI so that we
can't ask for a new image while waiting
for another image to load and then we
call the get image from flickr method
this is where we'll start writing our
networking code first we'll create the
nsurl we can do this directly just by
copying the URL like we saw in the API
Explorer but from a design standpoint
something doesn't really feel right
about this it's not very maintainable
what if the names for the arguments
change or we want to change the URL use
different arguments it'd be much better
if we broke this URL into pieces
the good news is is we're going to help
you out a little bit if you've been
poking around you may have noticed that
we've created a separate swift fall
constant starts with where we've defined
all the constants for doing just that
breaking the URL into pieces here in
this file they're structs that contain
constants for the different parameter
keys and values that we want to use in
our URL so what's with the static
keyword and also what are these strokes
that are contained within the constant
struct first the static keyword it's
similar to the class keyword and what
it's doing here is it's saying this
method property it doesn't belong to
Flickr parameter keys struct instances
but instead it belongs to the whole
struct itself now that may sound a
little confusing but the benefit of this
approach is that we can refer to these
constant values using a really nice dot
notation and it's very intuitive so let
me show you what I'm talking about
and this is also going to help explain
the strokes with instructs that we saw
in the constants file so if we want to
specify the method let me make sure
which one that is
so Flickr parameter keys and then the
method value we can do this and just
like that we're referring to a constant
in this very nice dot notation that kind
of goes left to right and it reads in a
very intuitive way similarly we could
specify the API key by going constants
Flickr Opitz and Flickr thank values
parameter values here we go API key like
so
and because each of these properties the
method in the API key are declared as
static we never have to make instance of
the constant struct to use them now you
don't have to do it this way but we've
chosen it because it's a nice way to
maintain all the constant values in one
place where we can easily change them
back in the view controller we can use
these constants to build the URL and
allow a print statement for good measure
so let's build and run and test of our
URLs what we want and this is not bad
you'll notice that in the API key
argument here I have the your API key
value you want to substitute your API
key in there but I think we can do a lot
better than this this is actually this
might be harder to see then the first
one was I propose that we optimize the
building over URL by creating a method
that formats all the arguments and this
will be more reusable obviously and
it'll also give us an opportunity to
escape any of the characters and the
arguments that might include unsafe
ASCII characters let's do this next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
