just forget about Z for now let's start
with the normalized vector 1 0 pointing
along the x axis if I draw a normalized
vector here at 0.8 0.6 the dot product
between these two vectors is simply the
X component 0.8 with the vector 0.707
0.707 a 45 degree angle here the dot
product is again the X component 0.707
with the vector 0.6 0.8 the X component
is 6 and that's the dot product it's
always the X component continuing on
with the vector 0 1 the dot product
between this vector and this vector is 0
vectors at right angles to each other
always have a dot product of 0 if you
work your way around with more vectors
you'll form a circle as you may recall
from geometry the cosine is often
defined as the distance and X of a point
on this circle so as this vector angle
increases the cosine of this angle is
computed by taking the dot product i've
known this fact for 30 years but it's
still slightly magical to me that taking
a dot product of two normalized vectors
which just multiplies and adds them
together gives you a trigonometric
function if you're still not convinced
what you can do is plot out the various
angles and what dot product you get out
of them and you'll see you actually get
a cosine curve so here are 2 normalized
vectors when you take the dot product
geometrically what is happening is that
one normalized vector is being projected
onto the other that is the dot product
shows how far one vector extends with
respect to some given vector so for 0.6
0.8 the vector extends 0.6 along our
initial vector another way to say this
is that one vector projects onto the
other vector to give this distance this
works both ways our initial vector can
also be projected onto the second vector
and get you the same length 0.6 in other
words the dot product operation is
commutative a dot b gives the same
answer as B dot a projecting one way
gives the same answer as projecting the
other that's it in a nutshell the dot
product projects one vector onto another
vector if both vectors are normalized
dot product gives the cosine between
them we'll see in the next unit on
transforms what happens when one or both
vectors are not normalized for computing
the shade of the material however we
have the tool we need so let's use it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
