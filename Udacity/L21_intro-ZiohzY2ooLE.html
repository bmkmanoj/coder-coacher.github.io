big computations computations where for
instance the problem can't fit in the
memory of a single computer or
calculations that need so many
operations it would take hundreds of
years to finish them using only a single
computer now when the computation is
really that big you might ask can I
harness the collective power of many
computers but to design an efficient
algorithm for such a machine you need a
suitable abstract machine model and
that's the goal for this lesson for you
to develop just such a model this
particular model and its variants go by
many names which you're bound to
encounter as you read the literature on
your own these names include the network
model the distributed memory model the
message passing model the communicating
sequential processes model and probably
a zillion others that I've forgotten now
personally I like message passing and
for reasons you'll soon see alpha beta
now if any of that seems confusing don't
worry the basic abstraction is really
simple you have a bunch of computers
collectively carrying out a computation
to coordinate they communicate with one
another by sending mass messages back
and forth this message passing style
stands in stark contrast to shared
memory their processes or more likely
threads communicate by reading and
writing shared variables now before you
start I think it's really important to
think big that's because distributed
memory computations are all about
solving problems that are really really
huge how huge you ask well let's start
with a quick warm-up exercise to get you
thinking about computations at the right
scale</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
