cycle because I want to show you how
they relate to the traditional
activities of software development
because this is the first time that we
talk about inception elaboration
construction and transition so we know
what they mean in terms of the
traditional software development so I'm
going to first discuss this relation and
I'm going to talk about each individual
phase in further detail so I'm gonna
start by representing the four RUP
phases here with possible internal
iterations I 1 V 1 and E 2 C 1 C 2 and
so on and just as a reference this is
the way in which time would progress so
we will start with inception and we will
finish with transition so what I'm going
to do now is to show the actual
traditional software development
activities here on the left and I also
want to show you using this diagram how
these activities are actually performed
in each of the RUP phases so let's see
what this representation means basically
what I'm showing here is that
requirements engineering actually starts
in the inception phase so you can see
the height of this bar as the amount of
effort devoted to this activity in this
specific phase so you can see that
requirements engineering starts in the
exceptional phase is mostly performed in
the elaboration phase and then it
continues all thought to a lesser extent
throughout all phases up until the end
of the transition but the bulk is really
performed here in the elaboration phase
similarly if we consider analysis and
design we can see that analysis and
design are mainly performed in the
elaboration phase but a considerable
amount of it also continues in the
construction phase and any kind of
phases out so there's very little of
that done in the transition phase
looking at the implementation you can
see that the implementation happens
mostly in the construction phase which
is unsurprisingly the phase that is
mostly concerned with actual code
development as we will see in a minute
testing on the other hand is performed
throughout most phases with peaks
instant specific point for example at
the end of some iterations like here and
here in to conclude we have the business
modeling activity that happens mainly in
the inception and a little bit in the
elaboration phase in the deployment
activity which happens a little bit
throughout but the bulk of it is really
in the transition phase which is
actually the phase that has to do with
deployment and then maintenance so I
hope this a kind of high-level view
give you a better understanding of what
is the mapping between these new phases
and the typical
software development activities that we
are more familiar with so to further
this understanding later in the lesson
I'm also going to talk about these
specific phases individually first
however I want to spend a little more
time discussing on what happens inside
each one of these iterations just to
make sure that we all understand what an
iteration is exactly</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
