you've had so far in the course and
let's break it down one step at a time
you need to figure out the
double-stranded DNA sequence the mRNA
sequence and fill in the blanks for the
amino acids in the resulting protein
based on the limited amount of
information that you're given here one
of the first big questions conundrums
you have to figure out is which of the
DNA strands of the double stranded DNA
is being used as a template to make the
RNA from to then go on and make the
protein and there's only one clue in
this entire diagram that gives it away
here the T thymine and the you for
uracil remember that both thymine and
uracil base pair with a they are
interchangeable with one another tea and
you so if the mRNA sequence has a you
here and this strand of the DNA has a
tee we know that the other side of this
double stranded helix must have an A
based on our DNA base pairing rules and
a pairs with you which means that the
mRNA sequence was built was transcribed
by pairing with the top strand here of
the DNA double helix so let me just fill
in a couple of links here guanine pairs
with cytosine and onion pairs with
thymine and now we know that the uracil
paired with the add name so the fill in
the mRNA sequence you need to know
what's complimentary with cytosine and
thymine well here we know it's G and
here we know it's a guanine and adenine
and notice that the mRNA sequence looks
like denti colinde this code on to the
DNA sequence from which it was not
transcribed right the non template right
TGA UGA they're the same it's just that
the findings have been replaced with use
so let's see if we can fill in the rest
of the pieces here we know that guanine
pairs with cytosine thymine pairs with
adenine cytosine pairs with guanine but
how to get these other pieces when we
know that cytosine pairs with guanine
and we know that the guanine what it
pairs with goes here this sequence of
DNA should match the mRNA sequence
exactly except for the thigh means in
the yourself so I can put those pieces
in there and I can fill in this piece
here
so now we've got the DNA double helix
down but we're missing this one codon
here there's only one codon for
tryptophan and it's you GG so this means
that the sequence here and the DNA would
be TGG right because it matches the mRNA
except for the t's in the use and here
we have the complementary sequence ACC
now we have the complete DNA a
double-stranded sequence now let's get
filling the mRNA we know that's going to
be a guanine it's going to be a cytosine
and thymine right it should match here
except up I made a mistake my mrna has a
tee it should only have you're so right
all diamonds are replaced by yourselves
so now let's fill in the protein
sequence GCA codes for alanine or a la
we already have tryptophan and look UGA
is what it's a stop codon so nothing
happens to this is a sub there's no
amino acid and then this codon cgu it
codes for arginine but do i write
arginine here no because it's after the
stop codon nothing's going to be
translated here because the ribosome
fell off at the stop codon and
translation stopped so hopefully you're
able to arrive at this answer by
synthesizing all of the rules and the
information we've learned about in
lesson two and three up to this point</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
