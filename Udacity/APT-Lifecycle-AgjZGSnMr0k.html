apt it starts by identifying the attack
target for example the target can be a
automobile or aerospace company then the
attacker will research about the target
in particular obtaining information
about the target organization that can
help the attack
for example using network scanning and
analysis the attacker can learn the
target organizations network and
therefore the vulnerabilities of its
network services such as the possible
security flaws of its web servers and
values searching the web the attacker
can also learn the organization's
c-level executives and the email
addresses for example many companies
list their c-level executives on their
web pages and once you know their names
it is not hard to find their email
addresses by doing some web search then
the attacker can develop a method to
penetrate the organization's network he
can make sure that the attack will go
through without detection by utilizing
the knowledge he has learned about
organization for example the attacker
can exploit a new vulnerability of the
organization's web server and since the
vulnerability is unknown to the security
community the network defenses at the
organization won't be able to detect
this exploit Oh
the attacker can send a so called Pia
phishing email to the chief marketing
officer of the organization it is called
spear phishing because the attacker has
spent time learning about the
organization and the individual and so
the email will appear to be legitimate
once the expose succeeds now the apt has
a foothold in the organization it can
then communicate back to the attacker
for example it can accept new malware
updates receives commands etc for
example you can now exfiltrate
valuable data such as the design of a
new airplane the APD will try not to
raise any suspicion so that it can go
undetected for example it would only
activate rate data from the server only
when there are other legitimate network
connections from the server to the
Internet and it does not operate on any
other server if that server is not
useful to the current task that is it
would keep its footprint as
as possible well as the previous
generations of malware including parts
and worms would try to in fact as many
machines as possible this cycle repeats
and continues for example the attacker
based on information sent from the apt
inside the organization
now learns that there is another part of
the organization that also holds even
more valuable data
the attacker now identifies that part of
the organization as a new target and
this cycle continues</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
