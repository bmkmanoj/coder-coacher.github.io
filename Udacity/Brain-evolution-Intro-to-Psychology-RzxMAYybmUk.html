that makes us most human so our
opposable thumbs is walking on two feet
well I would argue it's the brain its
overall size and structure now the brain
is not always looked like this three
million years ago with the first humans
habilis it was much smaller and then we
had a rectus and then we had Neanderthal
in the last two hundred thousand years
we've had us modern humans or Homo
sapiens and the thing that really has
changed across these different species
is the frontal lobe right here it's
bigger it's more complex and it's the
frontal lobes that really do make us
human it's where we think abstractly
that's where we have working memory
think about the past in the future and
we're creative and it's that creativity
that we saw first store long ago in the
cave paintings and we continue to see
currently in modern society just
explosive creativity art science music
dance and so on so I would argue it's
the brain that makes this most human</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
