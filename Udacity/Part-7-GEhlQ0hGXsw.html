into account I guess you know there is a
point if if there's not a period at the
end we might have an exception will take
that into account then the the code
prints a new line and then we're for the
3131 that comment are we assuming that
we were going to assert something here
with the use of the word assert or is
that just set up well I know it's more
like a note for myself that you know the
count is accountable blanks and next is
the Sentinel just because that's the
condition that should be verified here I
mean I might make that into an assert
later on I want you for my own
edification and amazement these 1234 for
prep lines in a row tell me what you're
expecting to see coming out of each of
those I'm just expecting to see on some
white space suit under the first one
will be a blank plane yeah just you know
to kind of put some distance between the
list of the Second World War let's just
say the number of blank is yes sir like
this and then bring the number of
Blanche of the country oh yeah now
you're right that should as I said I
mean it was kind of a writing this in a
hurry and yeah this you did with your
the next line and they're living with
contiguous with the text yeah well all
of that that's not actually how this is
trent oh I'm sorry print and no pressure
we just aren't boston to wipe maybe more
attention to the lucky i should bother
yesterday folders they read it okay can
we just combine all four of these into
one and whisking captain cat Nathan sure
would use you know /n and is a slash n
it's a little bit okay sure yeah we
could use / n is that allowed in the
kind of code standards that we use you
just told me there weren't any standard
so this is just a little bit emotion
okay so this can be connect on cat
inated in one line maybe I thought that
this was a gun improved breathability
but that we might have you think I
decided that's not the case we have an
extra log sheet
I got another because I anticipated here
that we would have many defects well
obviously that's in the case maybe
you're being too picky but finally looks
like dogs but reputation precedes it but
let us continue by now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
