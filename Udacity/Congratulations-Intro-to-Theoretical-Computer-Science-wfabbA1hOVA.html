undecidable ones well that kind of
depends on your subjective view but from
my perspective of computer science
undecidability is the biggest and
meanest monster of complexity for a
computer there is no worse thing than I
can't do it which is undecidability so
the answer here is no but that also
means that you have completed your
journey which means that all that
remains to be said is congratulations
for completing our introduction to
theoretical computer science I consider
this to be a rather challenging course
so you should really be proud of
yourself for having learned so many
advanced concepts you have learned about
NP complete problems some of the
toughest problems that are out there and
you have also learned how to recognize
these problems so detecting NP
completeness you've also learned how to
navigate around NP completeness using
techniques such as search trees
pre-processing fixed parameter
tractability approximation algorithms
and other techniques such as randomized
algorithms and finally and this is all
but reveal you now even understand the
cliffs of undecidability i hope i've
convey to you that for many problems
that are very very challenging to solve
digging deeper into the underlying
algorithms and techniques can really be
rewarding because not only is it
fascinating but actually problems that
too many people will seem unsolvable can
be solved using the tools that you've
now learned theoretical computer science
or the science of challenging problems
is a very rich and deep field and you're
now ready to dig deeper whether you want
to dig deeper into the theory or you
want to dig deeper into writing your own
algorithms to solve nearly impossible
problems that is up to you but in any
case I wish you all the best for that
journey and once more congratulations
for completing this course</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
