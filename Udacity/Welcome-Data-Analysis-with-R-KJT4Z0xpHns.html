you understand what goes into the price
of a diamond and even if you're not

political history of the diamond
industry is fascinating diamonds gave
rise to the mining industry in South
Africa which is now the most advanced
economy in the region diamonds also
drove the British and the Dutch to
colonize southern Africa in the first
place and have driven conflicts ranging
from the Boer Wars to modern-day civil
strife across the region now you should
have some experience working with the
