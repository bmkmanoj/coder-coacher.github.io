lesson I'll walk you through an analysis
of diamonds you'll learn about the rich
history behind the diamond market and

to build a predictive model of diamonds

whether a given diamond is a good deal
or rebuff if you're in the market for a
diamond exploring this data set can help
you understand what goes into the price
of a diamond and even if you're not
looking to buy the socio-economic and
political history of the diamond
industry is fascinating diamonds gave
rise to the mining industry in South
Africa which is now the most advanced
economy in the region diamonds also
drove the British and the Dutch to
colonize southern Africa in the first
place and have driven conflicts ranging
from the Boer Wars to modern-day civil
strife across the region now you should
have some experience working with the
Diamonds data based on the problem sets
in this course all that Solomon guide
you through his exploration</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
