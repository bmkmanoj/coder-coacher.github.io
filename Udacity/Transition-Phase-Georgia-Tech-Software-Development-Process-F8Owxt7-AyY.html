if we are ready to deploy our product
then we can move to the transition phase
which has mainly to do with deployment
and maintenance of a system so what are
the main activities in the transition
phase as we discussed in our initial
lessons in most real-world cases there
are issues that manifest themselves
after deployment when we release our
software and actual users interact with
the software specifically users might
report the failures that they
experienced while using the system so
what we call bug reports or they may
report improvements that they might want
to see in the software so typically this
will be new feature requests and in
addition there might be issues that
don't come necessarily from a users but
that are related to the fact that our
system has to operate has to work in a
new execution environment for example
the new version of an operating system
or the new version of a set of libraries
when this happens we have to address
these issues by performing maintenance
specifically corrective maintenance for
bug reports perfective maintenance for
feature requests and adaptive
maintenance for environment changes and
the result of this is that we will have
a new release of the software other
activities that are performed in this
phase include training customer service
and providing helpline assistance
finally if you remember what we saw when
we were looking at the banking IT system
example the cycles within a development
are not necessarily completely disjoint
but they might overlap a little bit so
something as they might happen in the
transition phase is that a new cycle may
start so there might be some activities
that are related to the fact that we're
starting to think about a new cycle so
now let's see what kind of outcome these
activities will produce the first one is
a complete project with all the
artifacts that we mentioned before
another outcome is that the product will
be actually in use so the product will
be in the hands of the users and the
users will start using it will start
interacting with it for real not just in
a beta testing setting another outcome
will be a lesson learned what worked
what didn't work what should we do
different in the next cycle or in the
next development and this is a very
important part of the whole process
because what provides feedback between
cycles and between projects and as we
said before in case' we have an X
release planned or next cycle coming up
we might want to start planning for the
next release so another outcome will be
the plan for the
next release so similar to the other
phases also for the transition phase we
have a milestone which is the fourth
milestone in this case and therefore we
have an evaluation criteria for the
transition phase that will define
whether we reach the milestone or not
and in this case that one important
assessment is whether the user are
satisfied so users are actually using
our product now so we can get feedback
from them we can see whether the product
makes them happy or not
and we continue assessing whether our
expenditures are fine with respect to
our estimates and in this case problems
with this milestone might lead to
further maintenance of the system so for
example we may need to produce a new
release to address some of the issues
that the users identified as we
discussed a couple of minutes ago</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
