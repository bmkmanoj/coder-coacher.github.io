variables are synchronization constructs
which allow block threads to be notified
once a specific condition occurs Pierrot
proposed the condition as condition
variable abstraction as well as three
operations weight signal and broadcast
that can be performed on condition
variables in P threads condition
variables are represented via the
designated condition variable data type
the remaining operations align really
well with Bureau's mechanisms for
instance for weight P thread has a P
threat condition weight that takes two
arguments a condition variable and a
mutex just like what we saw in beer else
wait the semantics of this operation is
also identical to be real suede a thread
that's entering the weight operation a
thread that must wait will automatically
release the mutex and place itself on
the weight queue that's associated with
the condition variable when the thread
is woken up it will automatically
reacquire the mutex before actually
exiting the weight operation this is
identical to the behavior we saw in beer
else weight identical to the signal and
broadcast mechanism symbol P threads has
P thread condition signal and P thread
condition broadcasts that we can use to
either notify one thread that's waiting
on a condition variable using the signal
operation or to notify all threads that
are waiting on a condition variable
using the P thread condition broadcast
operation there are also some other
common operations that are used in
conjunction with condition variables
these include the init and Destroy
functions P thread condition in it is
pretty straightforward you have to use
this operation in order to allocate the
data structure for the condition and in
order to initialize its attributes like
what we saw with mutexes the attributes
can further specify the behavior that P
threads provides with conditions for
instance an example is whether or not
the condition variable will be used only
within threads that belong to a single
process or also shared across processes
in a similar
to what we saw with the mutex and
threats attributes data structures
passing null in this call will result in
the default behavior that's supported by
P threads that happens to be that the
condition variable is private to a
process just like threads condition
variables should be explicitly freed and
the allocated we use the condition
destroy call for that and finally a few
pieces of advice regarding the use of
condition variables first make sure you
don't forget to notify the waiting
threads whenever any aspect off a
predicate that some threads are waiting
on change make sure that you signal or
broadcast the correct condition
variables that these threads are waiting
on next if you're ever in doubt whether
you should use signal or broadcast use
broadcast until you figure out what the
desired behavior is note that with
broadcast you will lose performance so
make sure you use the correct
notification mechanism signal or
broadcast when you need to wake up
threats from a condition variable
remember since you don't actually need a
mutex to signal and broadcast it may be
appropriate for you to remove that
signal and broadcast operation until
after you've unlocked the mutex just
like what we saw in the introductory
lecture about threads we will point out
some of these options during the
discussion of an actual pthreads example
that we'll do next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
