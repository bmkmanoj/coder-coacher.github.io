we have an activity with an element that
we want to change namely this text field
here so let's switch over to Android
studio to see how we can do this in code
in the project window here under this
folder called values we have a file
called styles that XML this holds the
default theme for this application
called app theme as we can see we have
no customized properties in our app
theme as we can see from this parent
property app theme derived from theme
that app compat dot light dot dark
action bar now let's look at some of the
properties that make up this dark action
bar theme so there are a couple of ways
to do this
so if we right-click and go down to go
to and then implementation or you can
control click so we see this style right
here the theme action compat light dark
action bar that derives from base theme
app compat light dark action bar so if
we go to that one and we can see there
are a couple of properties here some of
the interesting ones here are the color
primary dark and the color primary now
you can go and see what those colors are
by doing another control click and we
see right here that that corresponds to
a black color so now that we're back in
our Styles dot XML file let's create a
new style so in this code right here we
have a style called my style that
assigns a greenish type color to Android
text color so now that we have our style
let's assign it to an actual element so
if we go back into our project view
let's go to layouts and then activity
main so here's the textview that we
previously had that shows up as a
grayish color let's go in here
so in this text views declaration we
just need to add this last line here
where we say the style is equal to at
style my style and that's referring to
the style that we created before called
my style one thing that you need to
notice is a style property right here
isn't a pendant with an Android : so if
we go over to the design view we can see
this green color here for our hello
world</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
