satisfy the correctness property
the third one does not and to understand
why well let's remember what the
correctness property is that's that for
any message and any key we have the
property that when we encrypt the
message with that key and decrypt it
with the same key we get the message
back and this is what we need for our
encryption to be decrypted we need these
functions to be inverses so for the
first choice the encryption function is
M plus K the decryption function takes
that input which is now called C and
subtracts K from it using the properties
arithmetic well this is indeed equal to
M for the second choice the encryption
function is the identity that gives us M
back certainly this does not provide the
security properties we need we haven't
hidden anything about the message and
then the decryption function is also
that identity takes nm gives us M back
so this satisfies correctness certainly
does not satisfy security the third
property doesn't satisfy the correctness
property and the easy way to see that is
to observe that the output of this is a
smaller set than the number of messages
so there for some choices of message and
key this maps to the same value and an
example with that would be if we choose
K equals 2 if M equals 4 then the
encryption of that message is equal to 0
because the remainder of dividing 4 by 2
is 0 but if we also choose the message 6
well then the encryption with that same
key of 6 is 0 since two messages map to
the same ciphertext there's no way they
could decrypt correctly they can't both
decrypt two different values because the
decryption is just a function it takes
that input it's going to produce the
same output in both cases in this case
it's going to produce 0 it's not going
to produce the message we need so this
is neither secure nor correct but once
it's not correct we know it's not useful
the first one as it is
is not secure but it's actually pretty
close to being secure and if we combine
the first one with a modulo operator and
we never reuse keys we'll end up with
something that's perfectly secure and
that's what I'm going to talk about next
I'll introduce the first cipher that
we'll talk about and it's actually a
cipher that is perfectly secure</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
