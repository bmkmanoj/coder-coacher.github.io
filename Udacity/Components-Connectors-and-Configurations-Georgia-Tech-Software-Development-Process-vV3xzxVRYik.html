a software component is an architectural
entity that encapsulate a subset of the
system's functionality and/or the
system's data
so basically components typically
provide application specific services in
addition to that a software component
also restricts access to that subset via
an explicitly defined interface and in
addition which I'm not showing here a
component can also have explicitly
defined dependencies on its required
execution environment in complex systems
interactions might become more important
and challenging than functionality and
this is why connectors are very
important architectural elements a
software connector is an architectural
building block task with affecting and
regulating interactions among components
so basically connectors typically
provide application independent
interaction facilities and it's worth
noting here that in many software
systems connectors may simply be
procedure calls or shared data accesses
so all concepts that we are very
familiar with but consider that much
more sophisticated and complex
connectors are also possible and
components and connectors are composed
in a specific way in a given system
architecture to accomplish that system's
objective and this is expressed through
an architectural configuration more
precisely an architectural configuration
or topology is a set of specific
associations between the components and
connectors of a software systems
architecture so now let's look at an
example that brings all of this together</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
