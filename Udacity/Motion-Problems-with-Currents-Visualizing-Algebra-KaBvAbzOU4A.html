problems by looking at the distance rate
in times of different objects we saw how
fast certain people could bike and we
saw how fast things could travel we're
going to tackle a similar motion problem
this time it's going to involve a
current in order to solve these problems
involving currents we want to be clear
on two words upstream and downstream if
we think about swimming laps inside of a
pool I could say that my speed would be
five miles per hour that's about how
fast I swim from each side of the pool
five miles per hour would be considered
to be my speed and still water since
there's no current pushing me forward or
backward I'm just swimming along inside
of a fool but what if instead I went
swimming in a river a river has a
current to it so if I swim downstream
I'd be swimming with the current and if
I swim upstream I would be going against
the current if the speed of the current
is three miles per hour and i know that
in stillwater i consume five miles per
hour what would be my speed if I was
traveling downstream and what would be
my speed if I traveled upstream right
those two answers here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
