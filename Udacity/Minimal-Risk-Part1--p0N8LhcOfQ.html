simple example again using our fours and
nines we're going to assume that we have
some feature that we're measuring x it's
typically a vector but I'm going to show
it here is a scalar so X goes from small
X so little x2 big X alright it's
changing changing values clearly all the
way to the left I've got more fours and
all the way the right I've got more
nines at the best decision boundary okay
and that's what's indicated in red here
at that boundary if I call it a four or
I call it a nine it should cost me on
average the same because in fact if
calling it a four would be less risk
than calling a 9 i'm going to move that
boundary this way and if cost calling it
a 9 is better than calling it a 4 i'm
gonna move the boundary that way so at
the best possible boundary the expected
loss the same regardless of which label
i announce all right so if we pick the
label for okay at that boundary okay
then the expected loss is what well it's
just what is the probability that it's
really a nine and that I call it a for
the cost of calling on 24 and what's the
probability that it's really a 4 and the
loss of calling it a 4 well if you
remember remember we assumed that the
loss of x 2 x is 0 that is there's no
cost of calling a 404 well that means
that this just reduces down to well if
I'm at this location X what's the
probability is really a 9 and the cost
of calling the 9 of four that's the
expected loss of saying for at that
location likewise what's the expected
loss if I say nine at that location well
symmetrically it's just what is the
probability that it actually was a 4 and
what's the loss of calling for a nine ok
so those are the two different value the
losses that I want now remember we said
before at the best decision boundary
either labeling a for labeling on the
cost the expected cost
the same so the best decision boundary
is where is the X such that the
probability that the class is really a
nine times the cost of calling a 904
will be equal to the probability that's
really a four times the loss of calling
a 49 when I set those two values equal
that's the ex that I want from my
decision boundary what that means is if
I'm going to classify a new point I'm
just going to look at these values right
at some new point X what's the
probability that it's really a 4 times
the probability that I call a four and
nine if that's greater than the
probability that's nine times the loss
of calling a 904 if that's true I'm
going to call this thing of four
otherwise I'm going to call it a night</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
