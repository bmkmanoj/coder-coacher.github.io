unit number two and we just put together
what we learned in the previous
hypothesis test unit and in the unit on
confidence intervals so this ends up to
be the dominant way of doing apotheca
testing we arrive at a very simple
formula that we can even program so
according to Wikipedia in the 2007-8
season the average NBA basketball player
was 6 feet and 6.9 8 inches tall that is
the same as 200 dot 6 6 centimeters all
for the sake of this exercise just to
one at zenia's let me question this and
see if this is actually acceptable so go
to a training game for NBA players so
here they are training and I dragged all
the players on the site and I take their
height and as I take those measurements
I find here the size as I observe in
fact I get everything from 199
centimeters to 2 or 6 in 1 centimeter
increments and now I'm going to ask the
two sided hypothesis test question
whether I shall reject the claim that
the average player in the NBA is student
centimeters is a 95% confidence level so
the trick goes as follows
you learn about confidence intervals
which is the mean plus minus a
probability factor a factor taken from
the tea-table times the square root of
the empirical variance of n that formula
you've now seen many times and practiced
when I plug this in here with the
appropriate a I get for the mean to 0
2.5 plus minus 1.9 1/6 if you want to
check this I'm using two point three six
five for a graphically what this means
is if he is the 200 and here are my data
points the mean measurement of the
sample sits over here and the 95%
confident level it stops at 200 point
five eight just short of 200 and that
means we reject the appositives of
Toinette centimeter based on our sample
of eight people because the
doesn't quite make it there now I should
argue that this isn't quite correct and
practice depending on what that town or
go to I might find a different sample
than a different town we say we didn't
pick these people completely
independently and it isn't accounted
here and it's just a word of caution but
I think you get the principle it's
really simple
use your conference interval and check
with the outcome lies within or outside
the conference interval</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
