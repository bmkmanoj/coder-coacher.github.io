is to use cipher block chaining the idea
here is that we use the ciphertext from
the previous block to impact the next
block so here's what this looks like so
we're still going to break our message
into blocks so this is the idea of
cipher block chaining we're going to
take each message block encrypt it with
our encryption function let's assume
it's still a AES using the same key so
we're using the same key for each block
we're going to get as output a
ciphertext instead of doing each block
independently though and having the
codebook property for the second block
we're going to take the ciphertext that
came out for the first block XOR that
with the message block and then make
that two input term Krypton functions so
this keeps going this means that the
result in CBC or cipher block chaining
mode the I encrypted block is the result
of encrypting the XOR of the eigth
message block with the I minus one
encryption block we have a little bit of
an issue with the first one the first
one well there's no 0th block if we just
did what was showing here well then we'd
still have a problem that we would see
repetition every time the first block
and a file is the same as the first
block in another file encrypt with the
same key we get the same c0 out so we
don't want that we're going to add
what's called an initialization vector
and we'll XOR that with the first
measure that keeps things consistent
each message is being extorted with
something before it's encrypted and this
might worry us that we're adding more
secrets we want to minimize the number
of secrets to be as few as possible the
IV doesn't really need to be kept secret
note that we're still encrypting it
encrypting this output it's helpful to
not reuse an IV though so it's okay that
make the IV something unsecret as long
as it's not always the same</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
