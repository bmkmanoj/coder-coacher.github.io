can convert a fraction to a decimal by
performing that division let's take an
easy one one-half this is the same thing
as 1/2 this might be a good time to
remind you that one is the same thing as
1.0 which is also the same thing as 1.00
which is also the same thing as 1.000
adding more zeros after the decimal
point here does not change the value of
one it just tells us a more precise
value for one so in order to be more
precise and to make division here a
little more easy I'm going to add a few
extra trailing zeros here and by adding
these extra zeros after the decimal
point I still have not changed the value
of 1 i'm just being more precise all
right on with the division 2 goes into
10 times now let's make sure that we put
our decimal point that's here we'll also
put it up here so now how many times
does to go into 10 here it should go in
5 times 2 times 5 is 10 and when we
subtract we get 0 and there we go we
have 0 here so 0.5 is our answer one
half is the same thing as 0.5 now you
give it a shot what is three-fifths as a
decimal enter your answer here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
