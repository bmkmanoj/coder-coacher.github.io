important to have a clear picture of a
traditional process and its address
space typically at the lower addresses a
process will have the instructions
followed by literals that is values in
the code then statically allocated
memory really the global variables and
then the heap which will grow upwards
and then at the top of the address space
and working its way down we have the
current stack of a process remember that
the stack includes all the information
local to a procedure parameters local
variables and the address of the
instruction to return to when the
current procedure is over in a
multi-threaded environment each thread
has its own stack but it shares
everything else with the original main
thread of the process so from a certain
perspective a thread acts like an entire
process unto itself and hence threaded
programming isn't much different from a
traditional programming the difference
comes from the fact that part of the
memory is shared on the one hand this
makes it very easy for threads to
communicate but it also means that extra
care is needed to make sure that the
threads coordinate as they use this
memory I should point out as well that
one can do parallel programming without
having multiple threads each
parallelizable tasks could have its own
process with its own address space and
it could communicate with the other
processes through message passing in
fact if we wanted to take advantage of a
distributed system or each processor has
its own separate physical memory we
would be forced to use this approach as
we think about multi-threaded
programming however the paradigm
explored in this lesson is more
appropriate to think of a shared memory
system where we have multiple cores
sharing a common piece of memory</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
