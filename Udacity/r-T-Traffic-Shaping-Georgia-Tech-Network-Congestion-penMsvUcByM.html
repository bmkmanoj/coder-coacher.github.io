divided into tea bit frames and a flow
can inject less than or equal to our
bits a nanny tea bit frame if the sender
wants to send more than one packet of
our bits it simply has to wait until the
next tea bit frame a flow that obeys
this rule has what's known as an artiste
Rafic shape in the case of our tea
smooth traffic shaping one cannot send a
packet that's larger than our bits long
and unless tea is very long the maximum
packet size may be very small so the
range of behaviors is typically limited
to fixed rate flows variable flows have
to request data rates that are equal to
the peak rate which is incredibly
wasteful if you have to configure the
shaper such that the average rate must
support whatever peak rate the variable
rate flow may send the RT traffic shaper
is slightly relaxed from a simple leaky
bucket because rather than sending one
packet every time unit the flow can send
a certain number of bits every time unit
now there's a question of what to do
when I flow exceeds a particular rate
and typically what's done is that if a
flow exceeds its rate the excess packets
in that flow are given a lower priority
and if the network is heavily loaded or
congested the packets from a flow that
exceeds a rate may be preferentially
dropped priorities might be assigned at
the sender or at the network at the
sender the application may mark its own
pockets since the application knows best
which packets may be less important in
the network the routers may mark packets
with a lower priority which is sometimes
called policing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
