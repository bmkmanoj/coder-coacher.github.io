different synchronization algorithms for
parallel machines both mutual exclusion
lock as well as barriers now it's time
to talk a little bit about performance
evaluation as those designers of course
they're always concerned about the
performance of these algorithms because
all the applications that sit on top of
the processor is going to be using the
algorithms that you've designed as those
designer and so the performance of these
algorithms are very very critical in
determining how good the applications
are going to be performing so we looked
at a whole lot of spin algorithms from
very simple spin on testing set to spend
with delay and spend algorithms that
respect the order of arrival of fairness
if you will starting from ticket lock
and the Cubist's locks all of these the
different kinds of spin algorithms that
we looked at and we also looked at a
whole number of barrier synchronization
algorithms starting from a simple shared
counter to a tree algorithm to an MVS
tree a tournament in dissemination and
I've also introduced you to several
different kinds of parallel
architectures at shared memory
multiprocessor that is cache coherent
which may be a symmetric multiprocessor
or it could be a non-uniform memory
access multiprocessor and you can also
have non cache coherent shared memory
multiprocessor and of course I last
thing that I mentioned to you is the
message passing clusters so these are
the different flavors of architectures
that parallel machines can be built
today and the question you want to ask
is if you implement the different types
of spin algorithms that I been
discussing with you which would be the
winner on these machines well the answer
is not so obvious depends really on the
kind of architecture so as always
designers it is extremely important for
us to take these different spin
algorithms and implement them on these
different flavors of architectures to
ask the question which one is the winner
may not always be the same algorithm
that may be the winner on these
different types of machines and the same
thing you should do for the barrier
algorithms as well so the barrier
algorithms
away from the counter to the
dissemination barrier all our different
flavors of algorithm and yet ask the
question which would be most appropriate
to implement on these different flavors
of architectures as always I've been
emphasizing that when you look at
performance evaluation that is reported
in any research paper you have to always
look at the trends the trends are more
important than the absolute numbers
because the needed nature of the
architecture on which a particular
evaluation may be done make the absolute
numbers down not that relevant but what
is important is trends because these
tiles of architectures that I've
mentioned to you they're still relevant
to this day and therefore what you want
to ask is a question these different
types of spin algorithms and barrier
algorithms when he implemented on
different styles of architectures which
one of those algorithms are going to be
the winners that completes the
discussion of synchronization algorithms
for parallel machines I encourage you to
think about the characteristics of the
different spin lock algorithms and the
barrier synchronization algorithms that
we studied in this lesson and we also
looked at two different types of
architectures one was a symmetric
multiprocessor the other was a
non-uniform memory access architecture
given the nature of the two
architectures try to form an intuition
on your own on which one will win in
each of these styles of architectures
verify whether the results that are
reported in the MCS paper matches your
intuition such an analysis will help you
very much in doing the second project</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
