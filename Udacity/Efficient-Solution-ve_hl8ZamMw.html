is that we're gonna use recursion and
I'm not gonna show you something called
the trellis diagram which is a way of
thinking about a graph model of this but
what we're gonna take advantage of
remember the Markovian property and
Markovian property says that the
probability of going to some state only
depends upon where I am now it does not
depend upon how I got here right so if
today is sunny the probability of
tomorrow being sunny is not affected by
weather yesterday was rainy snowy or
sunny that's my assumption it's my first
order Markovian assumption so to take
advantage of that we're gonna define
some auxiliary variables and define a
recursive algorithm so the first thing
we're gonna define is what's called the
forward variable alpha okay and alpha
sub T of I is defined to be the
probability of seeing all the
observations up until time T and at time
T being in state I okay that's exactly
what it says in this button well now
there's a box inside the box there so
it's the probability of seeing
everything from 1 until T and being at
in time T being in state I the really
cool thing about that is I can define a
recursive definition for this very
easily alright so you start off a 1 of I
is what well it's the probability of
having seen the observation at time 1
and the probability of being in state I
at time 1 ok well that's easy PI sub I
is the probability of starting in state
I and B I of Oh 1 is the probability of
seeing that first symbol if you were in
state I so that's how you initialize it
now comes the really rakul thing and
before we write it out think about it
this way at some time T the probability
of landing in state J is going to be
well either I was in state 1 before and
I ended up at state J or I was in two
before or I was in 3 before or
was in four before right and these are
what refer to as mutually exclusive so
the probability is just the sum of them
and that's how this is written here
right what this says is that alpha of T
plus one of J so that's the probability
at time T plus one of being in state J
and having seen all that 1/2 T plus 1
observations is just well just as I said
before it's the sum over all the
different possible states right there's
n possible states of possibly be being
in those states at time T that's what
alpha T is right and alpha T also
includes all of the observations up
through T times the transition
probability of going from I to J
remember we're trying to compute alpha T
plus 1 of J going from I to J so that's
the probability that I land in the state
J and now I also have talked about the
output symbol at time T plus 1 well
that's B sub J of Oh T plus 1 all right
and there's no way thing that I can
reach that J state from any of the
preceding states so I just define that
recursively that means I can do one more
really cool thing ok so I could
obviously run this all the way to T so I
could tell you the probability of seeing
all of the observations one through cap
T and landing and state 1 and all the
observations and landing in state 2 and
landing is suppose all I want is the
probability of the observations all
right I don't actually care what state I
end up in well that means that the
probability of the observation given the
machine and that's what we're trying to
compute is just the sum of all the alpha
cap T of eyes right alpha cap T is
probability of seeing all of the
sequence of AI meaning and landing in
state I i sum that up over all the eyes
and that's the probability of the entire
observation sequence so you recursively
solve that problem so remember before it
was end to the T which is a really
really awful number
the complexity of this is just M squared
T okay through the recursion each time
step you have N squared things you have
to look at you do it T times and so it's
n Square t and for any reasonable
numbers N squared T is way way way way
less than n to the T all right so that's
that efficient solution of the forward
using the forward algorithm and allows
us to recover solve that first problem</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
