many other protocols the most commonly
used implementation is the one it's
implemented on top of HTTP which is the
hypertext Transfer Protocol this is the
key protocol for the web when you
combine TLS with HTTP what you get is
HTTPS which is rather awkwardly an
acronym for hypertext Transfer Protocol
secure first we're going to look at a
protocol that's not quite TLS this will
give you a basic idea of how TLS works
but there's some vulnerabilities in the
protocol which we'll talk about fixing
next so here's our client which is
typically a web browser and our server
which is the web server
the first step in the protocol is the
client connects to server sending a
message hello without the exclamation
point it also sends information about
what ciphers it is able to use different
versions of browsers will have different
ciphers implemented the server and the
client need to agree on a particular
server the client will also send a list
of the ciphers and the hash functions
that it has implemented different
browsers will have different ciphers
implemented it's up to the client and
the server to agree on the one to use in
the second step the server responds that
response includes several things it will
pick the cypher and the hash function to
use those will be selected from the list
of the clients sent based on the ones
the server can use and it should pick
the strongest ones that are acceptable
to both it also sends a certificate and
what that certificate is is something
that gives the public key of the server
to the client in a way that the client
can trust it and so what's in the
certificate is the domain the name of
the server as well as its public key
there's some other information like
expiration times that these certificates
expire and the important thing about
this certificate is that it's signed by
a certificate authority we'll talk more
about certificates later but the
important thing the certificate does is
gives the client access to the server's
public key in a way that the client can
trust it the next step is for the client
to verify the certificate
since the certificate is signed by the
private key of some certificate
authority that means the client needs
the corresponding public key to verify
the signature the client also extracts
the public key from that certificate the
next thing the client will do is select
a
number some random value that will be
used to generate the session key so in
the third step the client wants to send
back that random value to the server but
in a way that's secure let's make that a
quiz to see if you can figure out how to
do that so the question is how should
the client securely send the random
value to the server
check the best answer from the list
