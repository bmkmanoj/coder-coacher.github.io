the first character in the stream using
the rate method also in this case
suitably followed by semicolon I hope
that makes you happy I'm very happy with
it that's great and and then we print
line in which we print this character
that we just read them ok so for 419
should we this extra white space around
next this kind of goes back to line 10
where we have some extra white space
between the two brackets for the string
is there a what do you want to do there
we do we always want have pad space
around the functions or the arguments
into the function yeah I guess that's
something dat took did that it's not
much fine with you know doing it without
the spaces it's not consistent we can
print it yeah we should again we need to
have a standard of some kind I think so
it's obvious you don't have any kind of
coding standard yeah most of your
philosophy could I don't think well
that's not about Greg nice to guess I
think it was yes the only paste so
hodgepodge of different styles so
there's only one is kinda no no empty
spaces and Uncas variables at the no
copying of code from from random forums
online that might be I said okay dr. bed
for lon woods isn't that doesn't that
mean we're going to have to recode stuff
that we might save energy by capping
maybe it was long as we're copying
internal code that has the the standard
the standard applies when we need to
write something that a standard checker
for our internal use right let's
continue doctor but okay hmm so after
this we enter into a while loop with a
given condition and then that at that
point once we get into the while loop we
check if the next character that we read
is a blanket thank you have a problem
here we should be stopping when the next
doesn't equal the Sentinel otherwise
we're just stopping maybe immediately do
we even enter this league unless the
first characters are we our count our
count will be Z we're not going to count
the blanks if we because we want to stop
at a period
correct we're going to read the number
of links and a sentence and stop at
least that's how I'm reading it ooh oh
yeah I'm sorry about that one uh yeah I
was coding in a hurry i'm sorry and it's
yeah you're right this should be the
wild next is not a sentinel you know
yeah i'd have to apologize because I
kind of came through that when I was
going through I should have looked at
that more carefully worth doing the
reading or maybe you just copied
somebody's wild lupine didn't even
bother to check what it was about well
in this case I think it's actually my
fault so sorry about that Oh kind of
leaned over happy you apologize cannot
blame everything on Bobby we get just
for a second revisit every other thing
we've talked about previously I just so
I'm supposed to be recording the
severity so I assume all the severity of
everything up till just now is minor
they're bigger and this is our first
really major severity that's some sweet
some defect what are our severity levels
well according to our little log here we
only have major and minor okay so then
yeah I would agree with that I summon
some of the things I would have tried to
put in between but we don't have an in
between so I think you've got it right
the best we can do with what we got</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
