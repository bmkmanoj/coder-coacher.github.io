it's one one all right how would you
figure that out well first I'd ask if
that's correct we'll see when you try to
figure it out okay so the idea here is
I'm trying to figure out what curly
would get if smooth was out to get make
certain that curly got the worst
possible value so curly gets to cheat
currently gets to choose among rows and
smooth gets to choose among columns so
if I chose the B column then curly could
get a 1 you know given a choice curly
would go for the first row instead of
the second row because curly would get a
1 if I took the S column as smooth
smooth took the S column then curly
would choose the second row and would
get 2 and 1 is lower than 2 so smooth
would choose the first column and curly
would have to get the first row and it
would end up in the one that makes sense
yes but here's what you haven't figured
out yes
what happens if smooth because smooth
says I'm always gonna choose the
Backstreet Boys then you're right curly
should also choose that and at least
coordinate mm-hmm but what if smooth is
random say half-and-half random between
the two options and I don't know what's
gonna happen before then and you don't
know what's gonna happen sorry
I know that I know what's Happ curly
knows it's half and half but doesn't
know which one he's choosing in a given
time exactly I see then I would end up
with 1/2 and 1 then for choosing B the
expected score would be 1/2 and for
choosing s to the expected world expect
to score will be 1 yep oh I see and and
then curly would choose s and get the 1
right and that's still consistent with
with that mm-hmm
can we work out what the what the worst
case is what do you mean well I feel
like we should solve it like a zero-sum
game like we did in your lesson say that
smooth is executing a probability either
X or 1 minus X so I thought you're
asking for like a pure decision that was
even thinking about mixed decisions ah
yes it could be a malicious and
randomized adversary we really are
talking about my ex-girlfriends ok so
you just do the math do the math alright
so if we if smooth chooses actually
points with probability X and sting with
probability 1 minus X mm-hmm then it's
curly
for choosing Backstreet Boys we'll get X
on average and for choosing sting we'll
get 2 times 1 minus X on average and the
useful point is going to be to discover
when these are equal to each other
yep so in fact smooth by being malicious
and stochastic can actually force things
down to 2/3 hmm and things being
symmetric as they are clearly can do the
same okay so basically curly can behave
in such a way that even against the
malicious adversary it could guarantee
himself to 2/3 yeah a malicious possibly
mixed answer that's right okay but one
woman be right if he was taking with
pure strategies but why would we do that
that's right but for the purpose if
that's right and you can't do a version
of the folk theorem in fact there's lots
of different flavors of the folk theorem
the one that we're gonna focus on is
gonna allow for these mixed strategies
but in fact in general you could say you
know no I kind of like the mixed
strategies let's just stick with that no
I like the mixture I just do I just
wasn't thinking about them so I want to
point out that in fact the solution that
you gave I think that actually does
correspond to what is usually called min
max which is the pure strategy yes the
min max is is in fact 1 1 the other
concept is really important too though
and I think it's sometimes called the
security level profile so instead of the
min-max profile the security level
profile and that allows for the
possibility of mixed strategies so that
gets you down to the 2/3 2/3 I think you
know it turns out that there's folk
theorems that can be defined with either
of those concepts I prefer this one but
I do like this name better so I
apologize if that made things confusing
I'm not confused now I think in the end
Michael the important thing is we were
both right well the example that I'm
going to next these two concepts line up
so let's let's do that and then we don't
have to care I'm all for that let's do
that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
