we're going to call sort than reduce by
key is one that I'll just sketch out
primarily because we haven't discussed
the underlying algorithms yet we'll get
to them in the next lecture however
it'll be a great mental exercise for you
to think about how you might implement
this approach let's think about our
entries here we have eight entries as
key value pairs the key is the bin
number and in this example we're going
to have three bins 0 1 &amp;amp; 2 and the value
is 1 which we're going to add to each
bin this algorithm has two steps the
first is a sort the second is a reduce
so first let's look at the sort we're
going to sort the key value pairs by key
so here's our keys and notice it's the
same key value pairs that we have up
here but now they're in ascending order
by key and the second step is to reduce
the result by key naturally enough this
algorithm is called reduced by key what
I mean here is to add all the elements
that have the same key together so we'd
like to add these four ones up to create
the reduction value of 4 or more
generally to reduce these values using a
reduction operator note that all
elements with the same key are
contiguous which is the key to making an
efficient implementation now again this
is likely not something you can do with
the algorithms that you know so far but
libraries of parallel primitives may
have implementations for both of these
operations for instance the thrust
library that accompanies a cuda
distribution implements both sort and
reduce by key methods thinking about how
you might implement these two operations
is worth your time over the next week</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
