gathered data from people who worked
closely with animals for a long period
of time and particulars species of
animals such as animal trainers zoo
keepers and wildlife experts the key was
that people had to be very familiar with
many individuals of a certain species so
they could rate unique behavioral
tendencies that is personalities what
they found was members of the same
species acted in unique ways over a long
period of time that is they possess
unique personality traits and
surprisingly the dimensions of
personality that we use for humans is
relatively similar to those seen in
animals let's look at this figure here
we see we have ocean so openness to
experience conscientiousness
extraversion agreeableness and
neuroticism here we see that these
animals have the unique trait of
openness so they vary in their openness
to new experiences we see
conscientiousness and chimpanzees and
horses so within these two species
there's a variation of how conscientious
different animals are asked for
extraversion we see that nearly all of
the animals except the hyena rat and
chickadee show variations in being
extroverted similar to extraversion we
see that agreeableness is seen in many
animals except for Guppies chickadees
and octopi and asked for neuroticism we
see that many animals exhibit this
feature except for a few</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
