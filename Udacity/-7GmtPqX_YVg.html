we need to learn new language this will
be a way to describe what we want the
computer do in a much more precise way
than we could in a natural language like
English and it's a way to describe
programs that the Python interpreter
can run one of the best ways to learn a
programming language is to just try
things you can try that in the Python
interpreter that's running in your
browser let's for example try running
print 2 plus 2 plus in English
someone could probably guess that the
value of 2 plus 2 plus should be 4 in
Python when we try running this we get
an error and the reason we get an error
is that this is not actually part of the
Python language the Python interpreter
only knows how to evaluate code that's
part of the Python language if you try
to evaluate something that it's not part
of the Python language it will give you
an error errors look a bit scary the way
they print out but there's nothing bad
that can happen it's perfectly okay to
try running code if it producing an
error that's one of the ways to learn
about programming the error we got here
is what's called a syntax error that
means that what we tried to evaluate is
not actually part of the Python language
like English python has a grammar that
defines what strings are in the language
in English we can make lots of sentences
that are not completely grammatical and
people still understand them but there's
some underlying grammar behind the
language those of you who are native
English speakers might have learned
rules like this in what was once called
grammar school those of you who learned
English as a second language probably
learned rules like this when you were
learning English so English has a rule
that says you can make a sentence by
combining a subject with a verb followed
by an object
almost every language has a rule sort of
like this the order of the subject and
the verb and the object might be
different but there's a way to combine
those three things to form a sentence
the subject could be a noun the object
could also be a noun and then each of
these parts of speech well we have lots
of things that could be so a verb could
be the word eat a verb could also be the
word like and there are lots of other
words that the verb could be a noun
could be the word I and noun could be
the word Python a noun could be the word
cookies the actual English grammar is of
course much larger and more complex than
this
but we can still think of it as having
rules like this that allow us to form
sentences from the parts of speech that
we know from the words that make those
parts of speech the way we're writing
grammars here is the notation called
Backus North LOM and this was invented
by John Backus so John Backus was the
lead designer of the Fortran programming
language back in the 1950s at IBM this
was one of the first widely used
programming languages and the way they
describe the Fortran language was with
lots of examples and text explaining
what they meant and this is a shot from
the actual manual for the first version
of Fortran this works ok many programs
were able to understand it and guess
correctly what it meant but was not
nearly precise enough and when it came
time to design a later language which
was the language called Algol it became
clear that this informal way of
describing languages wasn't precise
enough and John Backus invented the
notation that we're using here to
describe languages</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
