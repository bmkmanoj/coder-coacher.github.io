sounds view controller first we have to
tell Xcode that our record sounds view
controller conforms to the av audio
recorder delegate protocol that is to
say we'll implement a function described
in that delegate protocol and our view
controller can act as the delegate for
AV audio recorder in our record sounds
view controller dot Swift file go to the
class declaration and indicate that we
conform to the av audio recorder
delegate by adding it here after
uiviewcontroller a class and Swift can
only inherit from a single superclass
but it can conform to as many protocols
as you want you just have to list them
here separated by a comma next we have
to tell the av audio recorder that the
record sounds view controller can act as
its delegate in the record audio
function we can set our view controller
self as a delegate to the av audio
recorder with this line scroll down to
the bottom of the record sounds view
controller dot Swift file because we've
already informed Xcode that our record
sounds view controller conforms to the
av audio recorder delegate if we start
typing we can see that Xcode
autocomplete automatically shows us the
functions available in the av audio
recorder delegate including already
recorded did finish recording if you hit
the return key exco to fill this
function out for us this is the function
we're going to use to call the stop
recording segue that we set up earlier
and move to the audio playback scene for
now let's just add a print statement to
let us know when a V audio recorder is
finished right here where it says code</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
