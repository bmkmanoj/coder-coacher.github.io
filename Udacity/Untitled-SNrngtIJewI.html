by animating multiple objects or even
the children of an item as the parent
itself moves in this example the cards
move on to screen at different speeds
helping to convey that they are separate
items when doing this it's key that you
do so in a coordinated manner here we
are achieving coordinated motion by
using a consistent direction and timing
all cards move in from the bottom of the
screen from different distances which
causes the closing up effect because
they use the same duration an
interpolator the seller a shin and
deceleration will link them perceptively
thanks to the gestalt laws of grouping
that we looked at earlier when moving
multiple items at the same time be
mindful to choreograph their paths in a
cohesive direction in this exaggerated
example each card arrives from a
different direction appearing chaotic
try sketching out the past that items
will travel upon to check that they are
coordinated avoiding overlapping paths
in conflicting directions in the real
world few items move in a linear fashion
so using linear motion can feel robotic
and unnatural in this example clicking
on an item performs a shared element
transition on the circle notice that the
difference between this straight line
transition and curved transition the
latter feels more natural be judicious
with this technique as it can attract
attention so make sure it's used when
that is your intention as we've seen
material surfaces can transform their
size shape and position we've also seen
how an item's elevation shows hierarchy
and importance when animating a change
in size of an item you want to avoid
having your users mistake this for zoom
effect which might imply an elevation
change like this example a good way to
do this is to animate the width and the
height at different rates making it
clear what is changing check the
instructors notes for the source of
these examples to see how they are
achieved</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
