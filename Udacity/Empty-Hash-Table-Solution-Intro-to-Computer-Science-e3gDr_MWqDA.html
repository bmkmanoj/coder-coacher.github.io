table we're gonna start by initializing
a variable I to 0 we need to keep a
count of the number of buckets so we're
gonna start by creating an empty table
and what we want to do is add n buckets
number of buckets to the table so we're
gonna use a while loop and we're gonna
loop while I is less than the number of
buckets so each time we go through the
loop what we want to do is add one empty
bucket to our hash table so we can do
that using append that adds a new empty
bucket and we need to remember to
increase I to make sure we don't keep
looping forever and so we're gonna go
through this loop and buckets number of
times each time adding an empty bucket
to the table and then we need to return
the table at the end so let's try that
in the Python interpreter so here's the
code just like we wrote out and we'll
print out the result of making a hash
table will keep the number of buckets
small for printing for real use we're
gonna want to have many more than three
buckets and let's run that and we see
what we got is a list with three empty
lists as its elements so this works okay
it seems like a lot more code than we
need and it is more code than we need
there's a better way to write this which
is to use a for loop so the general
structure we've seen for for loops
alright we've seen a loop that has has a
structure like this where the collection
could be a list it could be a string to
have a for loop we need some set of
objects that we're looping through in
this case what we want to do is loop
through the numbers from 0 to n buckets
minus 1 so we want to create a list that
contains those values so we what we
would like in order to be able to define
a procedure like make hash table is to
have a list which is the numbers from 0
to n buckets minus 1 Python provides an
easy way to do that it's called range so
range takes two numbers as inputs to
start in the stop number and what it
outputs is a list of all the numbers
from start up to stop minus 1 so this is
what range outputs a list of numbers
starting from start increasing by one
until we get to stop minus one you'll
note that it doesn't include the value
passed in as the second parameter in the
list this turns out to be useful because
oftentimes when we loop through elements
we don't want to include the
last element so that means if we
evaluated something like range 0 comma
10 the result would be the list 0 1 2 up
to 9 so now that we know about range we
could change our loop here instead of
having this while loop we could use the
for loop and we prefer this for two
reasons the first is it's going to make
our code shorter anytime we can make
code shorter that's usually a good thing
the second is it saves us from the
danger of forgetting to increment the
variable this is a common mistake and
when we forget to increment the variable
the loop just going to run forever so if
you can write our while loops as for
loops that's usually a good idea so a
better way to define make hash table is
to use the for loop we're no longer
going to need the variable I we still
need table and now instead of using a
while loop we're going to use a for loop
I'm gonna leave the variable name blank
for a second we'll figure out what to
put there later and what we're looping
through is from the range from 0 up to n
buckets so we're going to loop through
the elements of the list range to n
buckets that's going to be the list of
numbers from 0 to n buckets minus 1 and
for each one of those we want to append
one new bucket to the table just like we
did before we don't need to increment I
there's no I variable now and at the end
of the loop we return the table just as
before for this loop we didn't actually
need a variable here right we never use
the variable inside for the syntax of
the for loop well we still need
something here so I'm just going to call
the variable unused to make it clear
that we have a name there we don't
actually use it in the body of the for
loop so this makes the code a lot
smaller it will work the same way as
what we had before so here's the new
code several lines shorter than what we
had before does exactly the same thing
if you're really clever you might have
thought of an even shorter way to define
make hash table that unfortunately
doesn't quite work so the shorter way
would be to guess that the x operator
works on lists the same way it worked on
strings so we could do this by creating
empty list times and buckets this seems
great it's only one line really clear
and easy to understand and it looks like
it almost works so
try that in the Python interpreter and
it looks like it worked
we got a hash table a list with three
empty buckets there's one big problem
with this approach and I'll show you a
hint why it is and then we'll have a
quiz to see if you can figure out why so
now instead of just printing out the
result we're gonna assign it to a
variable called table and now we're
gonna mimic what would happen when we
add something to a hash table that means
we're gonna add something to one of the
buckets
let's pick bucket one and let's assume
we're gonna add the entry for Udacity
with one URL and now we can print out
what's in that bucket looks like
everything's okay what about what's in
bucket 0 now we get the same result so
think about what went wrong I'm gonna
ask a quiz to see if you can understand
why the simpler definition of make hash
table doesn't actually work correctly</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
