variety of different treatment options
for psychological disorders
psychologists from a biological
perspective may use drugs or psycho
surgeries as a treatment option where
some psychologists may favor
psychotherapy such as behavioral therapy
cognitive therapy or even humanistic
therapies for treatment and given that
so many of these treatments are
effective and have evidence to support
them many psychologists favor combining
them so for instance we can combine
cognitive behavioral therapy with drug
therapy to treat a lot of different
kinds of disorders and we also see that
mindfulness based meditation is rising
in popularity for a treatment option of
disorders such as depression anxiety and
even schizophrenia in addition if you
remember our lesson on consciousness
you'll recall that there are other
positive benefits to mindfulness
meditation including decreased overall
stress levels as well as improved mood
so will be interesting to see in the
years to come what further research
tells us about mindfulness based
meditation and finally we see that by
using a variety of these techniques a
person with a mental disorder can live a
completely full happy productive and
very enjoyable life which is great news
for all of us</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
