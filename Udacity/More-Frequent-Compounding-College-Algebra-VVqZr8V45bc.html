problems is plug the right numbers into
our equation up here let's start out
with the quarterly compounding option
what do we know well p equals twenty
thousand r equals zero point zero for N
equals 4 and T equals five great now
let's just plug these numbers in to
solve for a since that's what we're
looking for a will equal 20,000 times 1
plus 0 point 0 4 over for all of that
raised to the 4 times 5 power this
simplifies to 20,000 times 1 point 0 1
to the 20 if we plug this into a
calculator and round we end up with
24,000 403 dollars and eighty cents now
on to monthly compounding we do almost
exactly the same thing in fact all of
our information is the same except that
n is not for this time n is 12 since
there are 12 months in one year for a
then we have 20,000 times 1 plus point
04 / 12 raised to the five times 20 or
60 power plugging this into a calculator
gives us 24 thousand four hundred
nineteen dollars and ninety three cents
although these two total balances aren't
too far off of one another grant will
end up with slightly more money if he
goes with the monthly compounding
interest choice and look at that after
five years in either case he'll learn
over four thousand four hundred dollars
just by keeping his money in his account
that's a pretty good deal</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
