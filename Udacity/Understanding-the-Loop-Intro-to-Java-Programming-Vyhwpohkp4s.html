calculates the sum of the digits of a
number but we promised that this code
for iterating over each digit in a
number would be useful for validating
credit card numbers and here's why when
you write down a credit card number it's
really easy to switch to numbers and
that's pretty annoying for somebody
who's trying to charge your credit card
so you can buy things
luckily the designers of credit card
numbers back in the day thought about
this all credit card numbers have to
follow a kind of pattern and there's an
algorithm that uses the pattern to
figure out if the customer has
accidentally switched to numbers that
algorithm has a very similar structure
to the code for summing digits let me
write the pseudocode for this algorithm
so we can compare this algorithm with
the one for validating credit cards when
we trace this code we saw that it set N
and some and then for each digit in n
starting with the one on the right it
added the digit to the sum and then at
the end it printed the sum now here's a
question which of these lines of code is
responsible for making sure that the
code looks at each digit in N</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
