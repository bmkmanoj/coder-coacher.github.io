several topics we have already covered
in this class you may recall that early
on and disclosed we use frames to
understand stories of this kind now this
story is actually capturing some
information about a system in this
particular system there is a country
with people and president it also has
geological falls as a result of which
earthquakes occur that killed some
people so the components the complex
relationship between these components in
the complex processes that emerge out of
those interactions between the
components scripts two are related to
systems thinking dining at a restaurant
is a complex system once again there are
a number of components relationships
interactions processes functions and
script is a knowledge representation
that allows us to capture knowledge of
the stereotypical dining experience at a
restaurant when we discuss diagnosis at
that time we talk about systems thinking
a little bit more explicitly to begin we
said that diagnosis is identification of
a fault responsible for a malfunctioning
system diagnosis begins with the
observed data but some system war it's
our expectations of the behavior
expected of it the diagnostic task takes
the data and maps into the hypothesis
about false responsible for that
behavior what makes the diagnostic task
so hard again is that there are large
number of components that interact with
each other and it is a complex behavior
that emerges out of the interaction
between those components just think of
program debugging program rebuilding is
hard because there are large number of
lines in the code and these lines and
the code interact with each other and
very complex behaviors output behaviors
emerge because of those interactions
it's another good example of how
diagnosis is the case of systems
thinking is if we look at ecological
systems recently there's been a massive
drop in the population of bees around
the world that's our data as it turns
out the cause for this drop in bee
population is the presence of a
poisonous substance and insecticides
used in the past several years however
we can't see the process of bees getting
poisoned by this chemical all we can do
is infer it based on higher level
interactions of seeing the bee
populations drop and seeing a rise in
this chemical
so in this way there's multiple levels
of abstraction in this process there's
the visible bee population is the
visible use of pesticide but there's
also in an invisible layer where the
pesticide actually poisons the bees so
we have to discern the interaction
between these multiple levels in any
complex system will be many levels of
abstraction some invisible some visible
the human eye or human sensors more
generally can see only some of these
levels of abstraction invisible levels
of abstraction system thinking helps us
understand the invisible levels</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
