and the future of genetics and
personalized medicine I actually think
that bioethics and especially a
knowledge of genetics is increasingly
important because you know bioethics as
a concept originated as an idea of how
to protect participants in research and
consumers of health care people who
don't have all of the training and the
information held by the positions and
the researchers who are you know bossing
them around standing there in white
coats looking scary and saying give me
your blood I'm going to go do great
things with it it's important in order
to protect autonomy that people have as
we've talked about informed consent you
need to have the information going into
a study but I don't think protecting
informed consent is just about giving
someone a form when they're coming into
a study and saying this is exactly what
we're going to do this is what you're
going to experience do you sign on the
dotted line okay it's about making sure
that people have the tools to understand
their participation in such an area in
such a venture in the first place and
that's by entering the people are
educated about genetics about
personalized medicine about the
possibilities that their future and
their genetic code actually hold what
that actually means for them the level
of predetermine ISM or not the this
information actually implies and well
I'm perhaps a little bit biased in favor
of the study of bioethics because i
think it is super fun and interesting
and really important but you know
science is advancing it a pretty
breakneck pace and you know we won't
always get out in front of it like with
Gina but someone needs to be paying
attention and
you know you never want to say stand in
the way of any kind of scientific
advancement I don't think that's it all
what the study of the intersection of
ethics and science is about but ensuring
beneficial and responsible use I think
is critical to respecting the people who
make research possible so my background
I came to bioethics as a philosophy
major as an undergraduate I I began
studying human rationality mostly in
philosophical conceptions of
understanding individuals as rational
beings and what your ethical duties to a
rational being are that led me into
studying informed consent in medical
ethics because I found it fascinating I
mean especially how you get informed
consent how you get any kind of consent
from someone who isn't rational was
formerly rational was never rational fun
questions um and then that in turn led
me actually to becoming a lawyer because
I realized that law is the tool that
you're actually going to use to make
sure that people who cannot advocate for
themselves are nonetheless protected
yeah best advice I can give to learning
bioethics is just be open to figuring
out what the next weird issue is going
to be and learn all you can about it
that's why bioethics is fun right it's
sort of a mix between hard-nosed
practicality and science fiction you're
paying attention to what could go wrong
and how do we stop that or you know
aspirational fiction what what's not
great right now how can we make it
better Rachel thank you so much for
coming in thanks for bringing man</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
