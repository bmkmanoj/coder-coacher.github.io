files and I remember they were about
fifty photos inside that folder that you
downloaded so to rename 50 photos I
think I'll have to use some sort of a
loop so I'll just write one down now by
saying for file name in file list now
bear in mind file list is something
we've seen before in fact we printed it
out this was a list of all of the photos
inside the folder and what this for loop
is going to allow us to do is work with
each photo file one at a time so for
each photo I want to change its name and
the old name is in file name and the new
name well I know the new name is devoid
of any numbers but how to do that I
still don't know and this means I'll
have to do some experimentation and to
run those experiments I generally use
the Python shell window where I can just
start typing and seeing the result
really quickly let me make more room for
this window so you can see it properly
so say my file name was the following
string 48 Athens dot jpg let me print
that out okay good
now previously I googled to find out
that there is the string function called
translate that takes up to two arguments
the first argument is a table which
translates one set of characters to
another set of characters and since we
don't have that I can use the keyword
none and the second is a list of all
characters that we want to remove from
the string and those I know are numbers
so that will be 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 all
of those numbers let me try that oh hey
look the file name now has no numbers in
it so because that experiment worked I
will go back to the code and add this
file name dot translate function into my
code</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
