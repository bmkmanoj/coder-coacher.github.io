science and very little about technology
only three years ago when I took my
first class I remember the teacher was
talking about operating systems and I
did not know what an operating system
was but I think I just fell in love with
it so quickly that I've really tried to
ramp up my skills since then and now I'm
a full-time engineer so I think it took
me a long time to get to engineering
because I was interested in a lot of
different things
my most major activity outside of
programming is that I'm in Google's a
capella group which is called Google
fella
singing programming are both challenging
they're both the kind of thing that if
you focus your effort you can get better
at both of them and they're both
artistic and I think people don't really
consider programming to be an artistic
thing but there are so many ways to
build something and I think that there's
a feeling that it's extremely difficult
but I think with a lot of practice and
with exposure to computer science
materials then most people can do it I
think that a lot of people have this
false belief that they're locked into
whatever they decided to pursue in
college or whatever their first job was
there's a lot of flexibility and I think
if you find something that you really
like and you really want to pursue
there's probably a way to make it happen
