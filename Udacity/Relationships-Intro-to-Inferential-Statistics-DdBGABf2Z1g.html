really only been working with one
variable analyzing the mean and the
standard deviation and seeing where a
sample mean falls on this distribution
and if that's typical or not so typical
but now we're going to focus on two
variables with two variables we have a
different design this means we need to
change how we collect our data how we
visualize our data however our analysis
is going to be pretty similar and you'll
see later now that we're starting to
discuss two variables instead of just
one let's start by thinking about two
variables that might be related to each
other for example height and weight
people who are taller usually weigh more
or maybe time spent studying and your
grade may be the more time you spend
studying the better your grade will be
here's a weird one the outdoor
temperature and ankle injuries I read
this article the other day that said
that the warmer weather causes people to
wear more flip-flops and sandals that
make your ankles more prone to injuries
do you have any other ideas post about
it in the forums and maybe include some
information that you found that shows
this relationship</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
