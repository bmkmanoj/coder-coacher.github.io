command-line action not so fast you
might say don't we have to install
Gradle first not at all
Gradle x' first trick is that it knows
how to install itself all it needs is a
shell script and a tiny jar that knows
just enough to download and install
Gradle I have in this directory a copy
of the Gradle wrapper Gradle wrapper
consists of just a shell script we've
got one for Mac and Linux and we've got
one for Windows and then inside the
Gradle directory you have a tiny jar the
way the Gradle wrapper works is you call
it with a Gradle command it'll check to
see if Gradle is installed if it is
it'll just pass along your command if it
isn't the Gradle wrapper we'll go ahead
and download Gradle for you first let's
go ahead and run the Gradle shell script
and see what happens we didn't already
have Gradle installed so now it's
downloading it you see a lot of dots
even more dots all right there we go
Gradle has been downloaded welcome to
Gradle 2.3 hmm looks like Gradle decided
we need some help this option to see a
list of all available tasks looks good
let's try running this so let's try
running the tasks command using the
Gradle wrapper whoa that's a whole lot
of tasks that Gradle already knows about
and as we scan through all these tasks
hmm looks like there's a task that's
calling out to us let's give this one a
try now let's use the Gradle wrapper to
run the hello tasks along with some
diagnostic output we get a nice greeting
how sweet Gradle has to do a significant
amount of work to start up mainly
because it's required to spin up an
instance of the Java Virtual Machine
this startup time can be mitigated by
using the Gradle demon a demon is just a
process that hangs around in the
background of your operating system
doing something useful when Gradle is
instructed to use a demon a demon
process is started and continuously runs
in the background keeping the JVM
instance alive so that subsequent Gradle
runs can use the same instance by
default Android studio
always uses a Gradle daemon when running
Gradle from the command line however
you'll have to explicitly enable it
simply put you should always use the
daemon when possible by using the daemon
you can take advantage of huge
performance benefits that are planned to
get even better in future versions of
Gradle</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
