detailed look at several coverage
metrics and the first thing to keep in
mind there's a large number of test
coverage metrics out there in the
supplemental material for this class
what I'm going to do is link to a nice
article which lists 101 test coverage
metrics at first that sounds like a
little bit of a joke but if you take a
look at the list what you'll see is that
it's not too hard imagine situations in
which most of these metrics are actually
useful and if you read it you can see
that these things would probably
actually find bugs in real software
systems so what I'm going to do here is
talk about a fairly small number of
coverage metrics that matter for
everyday programming life and then I'm
going to talk about a few more that are
interesting for one reason or another
because it can give insight into
software testing but which you probably
won't actually use in practice so the
first metric we're gonna look at is
called statement coverage and this is in
fact the one that's measured by default
by the Python test coverage tool that we
already looked at and so you already
have a pretty good idea of what it does
well let's just go through in a little
bit more detail so let's just use this
very simple four line code snippet as to
an example and let's try to measure its
statement coverage let's say we call
this code with x equals zero and y
equals minus one well in that case this
X to zero test is going to pass and so Y
is going to be incremented by one making
y equal to zero now if y equals zero
also passes and so we're going to
increment X there are four statements in
this code fragment if we enter this code
fragment with x equals zero and y equals
minus one all four will be executed so
this will give us a statement coverage
of a hundred percent so that's pretty
obvious just really quickly let's look
at calling it with different values so
now if we call this code with x equals
20 and y equals 20 both tests will fail
and so we'll end up executing both of
the tests but neither of the then
branches of the if tests and so we'll
end up with a code coverage or two out
of four statements or 50% and so while
we're on the subject of statement
coverage I'd like to also mention line
coverage this is very similar to
statement coverage but the metric is
tied to actual physical lines in the
source code and so in this case there's
only one statement for each line so
statement coverage and line coverage
would be exactly identical but in the
other hand if we decided to write some
code that had multiple statements per
line line coverage would conflate them
whereas statement coverage would
consider them individual statements for
most practical purposes these are very
similar so the statement coverage has a
slightly finer granularity</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
