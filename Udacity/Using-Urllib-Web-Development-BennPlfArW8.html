dot 3 now if you put in big-ip we
accepted that but I'm pretty sure you
didn't use you are a lip too because
when I was finding the answer to this I
also cheated used curl and got big-ip
which is actually what dub dub
example.com uses but URL lib to
automatically follows redirects and the
server redirects to uses Apache so let
me show you how I got the example and
then we'll go ahead and talk about what
happened with the redirect okay so the
way I found this answer is I use URL ebb
to use the URL open function to hit WWE
example com store that in a variable and
then I looked at its headers and I see
that the server is Apache 223 and that's
the correct answer if we look at the URL
attribute on Pee Wee see it's actually I
Anna org now if you remember from unit
one I asked you what is the location
header when you hit dub dub dub example
calm and that was because well this was
the answer because example.com redirects
to iono org now URL lib to automatically
follows redirects which can sometimes be
confusing and in this case it
automatically followed the redirect it
hit iono org and whose server is Apache
but we were do this by hand i'm going to
use curl this is this is the unit one
example we can see that server is
actually big-ip so hopefully use do rlm
too but if you cheated like i did when i
was writing this quiz and you saw big-ip
will also accept that and it's important
to know when you're using these
libraries that a lot of these libraries
you are a lift to the default one
included with google app engine called
URL fetch they follow redirects
automatically and if you don't want to
follow the redirects say you are writing
a grading script for your homeworks you
need to look up the docs and there's
almost always an option to tell the
library not to automatically follow
redirects so that's something to keep in
mind when you get behavior you don't
expect has just happened to me okay
let's move on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
