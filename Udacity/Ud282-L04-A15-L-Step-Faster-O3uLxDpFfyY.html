the while loops and for loops our loop
counter is just a variable just like any
other variable we usually call it I for
simplicity but we could always call it
any other name the same goes with our
loop increment this can be any
mathematical operation that we could
normally do to an integer let's have a
look at a few common ones the most
commonly used one is I plus plus which
is just the shorthand of I equals I plus
1 and that simply adds one to an I say
for example RI was equal to 10 I plus
plus would change that to 11 we've also
seen I - - which is just a shorthand of
I equals I minus 1 and it basically
subtracts 1 from I so if I was 10 that
would make it 9 now we can step up
faster than just adding one or
subtracting one remember when we used to
add numbers to a variable just by saying
I equals I plus 5 or whatever number
this can be short-handed into I plus
equals that number so they both mean the
exact same thing in this case it's just
adding 5 to I and updating I into that
new value so say if I was 10 that would
end up updating I to 15 similarly goes
with I minus a number so if we say I
equals I minus 6 for example this can be
short-handed into I minus equals 6
meaning that if I was equal to 10
it would update it to for the exact same
goes with multiplication and division we
could update a valuable by multiplying
it with a number like so I equals I
times 3 so that multiplies I by 3 and
updates I to that new value the
shorthand for that is I x equals 3
just like plus and minus so if I was
equal to 10 that will multiply it by 3
and update it to 30 so the same goes for
the vision as well we can divide our
variable by a number like so I equals I
divided by 2 that would divide our
variable by 2 and update its value to
that new calculation
the shorthand for that is I divided
equal to so in this case if I was 10 it
will divide it by 2 and update it to
that which is 5 let's have a look at a
few examples that use those shorthand
let's say you want to print only the
even numbers between 2 and 10 so
basically you want to create a loop that
starts from 2 and counts all the way up
to 10 but instead of adding 1 to our
loop counter we want to increment it by
2 we've written a function here called
even numbers that doesn't accept any
parameters and it doesn't return
anything so it's called public void even
numbers empty brackets and then curly
brackets inside we only have this loop
here that starts with the loop counter I
equal 2 and it keeps counting as long as
I is less than or equal to 10 but our
loop increment is I plus equals 2 this
instruction here adds 2 to I every time
so every iteration in our loop I jumps
by 2 let's trace this and see what's
happening the first thing I gets
initialized to value 2 and I is less
than or equal to 10 so that's true
so we step inside our loop and we do
this print line operation which prints
out I as it is which is 2 we reach the
end of our loop so we go back up and the
first thing we do is our increment here
our increment adds 2 to our loop counter
I and it was 2 making it 4 and then we
do our comparison I less than or equal
to 10 which is true and so we step into
the loop and print out I again which is
just 4 we step back up we add 2 to our
loop counter which makes it 6 and 6 is
still less than or equal to 10 so we
print out 6 go back up add 2 8 is still
less than or equal to 10 so we print out
8 8 becomes 10 and 10 is still less than
or equal to 10 so we print our tenth
we've reached here so we go back up and
that adds 2 to our loop counter making
it 12 12 is no longer less than or equal
to 10
so that's false and we don't step into
the loop anymore so we don't print
anything else so once we change our loop
increment from just I plus plus to
something like I plus equals two you can
see that I is increasing in steps of 2
rather than 1 you could also change this
to I plus equals 3 for example and that
would grow in threes remember that you
could also use the multiplication like I
x equals 2 which means that every time I
would get multiplied by 2 rather than
just add 2 to it there's a lot you can
do with all these operations</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
