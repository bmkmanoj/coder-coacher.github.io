this is helpful at all well remember
what we're trying to do here since we
can't factor this expression we need a
different way to find the x-intercepts
here we can tell that we're getting
close to being able to do that at some
point we'll want to set y equal to 0 and
now we only have X written in one spot
in our equation rather than in two we
know how to take square roots so I feel
like we're getting pretty close at this
point we need to think about the
difference of squares again remember
that if we have a squared minus B
squared we can factor this as a minus B
times a plus B here we have one term
that's clearly squared so maybe we can
use this technique to help us out now
six doesn't look like a squared number
but that doesn't really matter we can
still of course take the square root of
six and get a number it may not be an
integer but it is a real number what I'd
like you to do now is keeping all of
that in mind write out the two factors
in this form that we have coming from
this expression right here this is going
to look pretty different from anything
we've worked with before and you may not
think it looks very pretty but just go
with it this is going to be super super
useful and everything you have coming up</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
