fixed and showing the effect on the
sphere in fact throughout this unit
let's assume each light is extremely far
away like the Sun so we can just look at
its direction instead of its position
that way we don't have to think about
the Delights direction changing as the
surface changes position here the
spheres normal changes with respect to
the light the lights effect is at a
maximum at the top of the sphere goes to
zero at the equator and stays that way
since the bottom of the sphere faces
away from the light this is what the
diffuse term looks like when the sphere
is lit from above this next point is a
little subtle but I think it's worth
going through a diffuse material is
defined as one that scatters light in
all directions above the plane according
to this cosine law so this green shows
how the amount of light scattered
actually drops off as the angle gets
steeper that is the amount of light from
a single point on a surface drops off
with the cosine of the angle of the
surface compared to the eye so you might
think less light would hit the eye when
the surface is viewed from a shallow
angle however a balancing factor is that
as the angle of the surface to the
viewer increases the area of the surface
visible through the pixel proportionally
increases that is you see more of the
surface even though less light per unit
area is reflected towards the eye these
offsetting effects give the net result
we want the viewers location doesn't
matter at all as the shave the surface
depends only on the angle to the light
itself not needing the eye direction
makes the diffuse term faster to compute
which is always important at an
interactive rendering</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
