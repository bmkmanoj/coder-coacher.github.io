that i can write out all the steps that
i'm going to need to simplify this
expression up here so as we talked about
before in other problems where we're
multiplying polynomials to deal with
these two i'm going to start the first
term of the first polynomial and make
sure that i multiply it by every single
term in the second polynomial so i'm
going to write out all of those terms to
start out so i have three terms here
reflecting the fact that i multiplied
this term by e to the three terms in
this expression now that the negative 4x
squared is taken care of i'll move on to
the X since that's the next term in this
first polynomial once again i should add
on three more terms to what I'm building
up here one for each of these terms
since I'm multiplying this by all of
them so now I have six terms total which
I can double check by counting them all
out and this is actually a really good
way to check that you're on the right
track in terms of the spot and the
problem you're at if I've already
multiplied out the terms that I need for
the first two terms of the four that I'm
going to need to multiply and there are
three terms that i'm multiplying each of
them by then it makes sense that i would
have two times three or six terms total
now let's continue by multiplying all
these by 2y and finally we get to the
last term in our first polynomial the
negative 6 and now we have a super long
expression this looks pretty miserable
right now but hopefully as we continue
to simplify within the terms then
combine like terms things will get to
look a little bit nicer really though in
terms of new material that this problem
covered our job is done all that's left
is for us to simplify although of course
this is a particularly complicated
simplification process because there are
so many terms we just have to be super
careful we end up with this lovely very
long final answer of negative 12x
squared Y squared plus 20x cubed plus
3xy squared + 6 y cubed minus 17 x
squared minus 10x y minus 18 y squared
plus 33 x plus 6y minus 18 wow that was
really difficult and if you got this
perfectly right I am so proud of you I
actually made a couple mistakes myself
and I was redoing the problem on the
tablet here you can see actually when I
was doing my work
that I had to put little check marks
above all the terms in this step before
I got to the final answer the reason
that I did that was I wanted to make
sure that as I rewrote each term down
here and combined it with its like terms
that i prevented myself from dealing
with it again so I put a little check
mark above a term when I wrote it down
here that also let me check that i
actually had dealt with every single
term that i needed to deal with i think
at this point if you got this problem
right you have mastered multiplication
of polynomials congratulations that's
pretty huge</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
