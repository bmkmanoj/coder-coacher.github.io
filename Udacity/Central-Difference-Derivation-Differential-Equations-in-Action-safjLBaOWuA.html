equation for heat conduction along a
wire now we look into its mathematical
meaning a scary name for this topic is
central difference formulas for
derivatives this is about determining
the derivative that means the slope of
the tangent of functions that are based
on empirical data measurements a naive
approach to determine the slope of this
function at this point would be to look
a little further to the right determine
another point of that function there and
then connect this point to our original
point and you can see that this does not
really work well when we wanted to
determine the derivative of our function
namely the slope of the tangent a simple
trick is to go a little to the left and
a little to the right
determine the points of the function
left and right and then connect these
typically this works far better now we
can write down some equations let's
Delta X stand for the total distance
from left to right the eight are always
denoting a difference the estimate for
the slope would be what we gained in
height divided by how far we went to the
right the denominator is simple Delta X
is how far we went to the right the
numerator is a little more complex it's
the difference of this value of the
function minus that value of the
function that's what we are gaining in
height so it's our function on the right
hand side f of X 0 plus Delta X half
from X 0 we're moving by half of this
distance to the right plus Delta x over
2 minus the value of the function on the
left hand side F on x0 minus Delta x
over 2 we're going to the left by a half
of the distance - now you can get an
idea about why this is called central
difference obviously it's a difference
and the difference is centered at X 0 we
are moving as much to the right as we're
moving to the left now we are going to
apply the same formula to the second
derivative the rate of change of the
rate of change think accelerate
we simply use this formula not for the
original function but for its derivative
you replace F by F Prime wherever you
find an F so this F becomes an F Prime
this F becomes an F Prime and this F
becomes an F prime prime the second
derivative but now we can use our
original formula for these derivatives
this is going to get a little long when
estimating this first derivative we get
an expression with denominator Delta X
and in the numerator we've got the
following we're moving to the right by
Delta X 1/2 so we're ending with f of X
0 plus Delta X moving one further Delta
F 1/2 to the right - removing Delta X
1/2 to the left which means this is f of
X 0 and now for this derivative we're
moving by Delta X 1/2 to the right minus
Delta X 1/2 plus the same cancers so
this becomes f of X 0 minus now we have
to move by Delta X 1/2 to the left which
becomes X 0 minus Delta X divided by
Delta X let's now collect what we have
found in total we're dividing by Delta x
squared and in the numerator we've got
plus the value of one step to the left
plus the value of one step to the right
minus twice the value at our original
position so what originally appeared in
our equation T 7 plus T 9 minus two
times T eight is one millimeter squared
times the second derivative of the
distribution of the temperature</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
