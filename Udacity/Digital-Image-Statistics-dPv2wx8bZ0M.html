about that images basically have a lot
of numerical values that we can actually
be traversing around on a matrix and a
regular grid now let's look at what we
can do with that kind of stuff one of
the things I wanted us to think about is
the whole concept of an image histogram
an image histogram basically measures
the statistics of the image in terms of
all of the great values that exist in
that image so imagine if I could is I
have created a bin which has values of 0
to 255 and every time I will scan
through this image and every time I say
come down to the first one I see the
value of intensity is let's say and in
20 I will put 1 there and then I will go
find another one might be 125 it might
move around and then basically it starts
measuring how many pixels have a value
of let's say 200 how many pixels have a
value of 100 and that will start kind of
creating a histogram of that image and
kind of start giving you statistics of
that image and this basically is what
this images histogram looks like with
the peak here comes down and closes this
way now interesting thing to note is
there not a lot of full hundred percent
white values here and if you look at
this image you might actually see that
to be true there is a few zeros dark
values here but most of the information
is right in the middle now of course we
don't have to do this for the entire
image another things to note is that we
can actually do statistics on the whole
image we can compute the average for the
entire image we can compute the median
or any other kind of statistical
statistical information for that image
the scope of this need not be the entire
image I could just say I want to do it
for this box or I want actually even if
I could figure out how to come up with
this just three screen what would be the
statistics of this or just the you know
pixels associated with that I of course
I would have to find the scope the range
of that region to be able to do those
computations in but that entirely
depends on us this histogram of course
is for the entire image but of course
instagrams could also be for specific
ranges I could do one for this region
this region this region and again it
basically starts giving me information
about what is
the range of information or the pixel
values the intensities for that specific
sub part it could be region based and of
course it could be channel days now I
haven't actually introduced the concept
of channels yet but that's coming soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
