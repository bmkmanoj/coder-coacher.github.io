debugging because when we fix the defect
we want to make sure two things first we
want to make sure that the defect is
actually an error that is it is wrong we
also want to make sure that the defect
causes the failure if a is the defect
and B is the failure we also want to
make sure that the defect causes the
failure if a is the defect and B is the
failure we want to make sure that if the
defect hadn't been there then the
failure must not occur either and these
are the two things we need to show when
we fix a defect in order to make sure
that the defect is an error we must show
how to correct it and to show that a
defect causes the failure we must show
that the failure no longer occurs after
we have changed it it is important to
show both that a defect is an arrow and
the cause in order to avoid situations
in which defect only is an error but
does not cause the failure or that
something causes the failure but it's
not an error let's look at these first
you can have an error that's not a cause
here's you looking at your program and
you look at the program and find tons
and tons of errors here's one here's one
here's one and you fix them and you
think you're done but you don't know
whether any of these actually fixes the
problem because it may well be that
these errors you find that none of them
actually causes the failure simply means
that after any fix you need to verify
whether your fix actually did the trick
and better yet before the fix you should
be able to precisely predict that your
change will actually fix the failure the
second category is causes that are not
errors if you think of our mozilla
example for instance we have found that
the Select tag in the input causes
Mozilla to crash when printing however
this is just a cause it is not an error
this is perfectly legal HTML input and
at the very least some input that
Mozilla should normally be able to cope
with in particular modular should not
crash on any input so what we have here
is a cause but we haven't found the area
the error is somewhere in the
probably in the piece of code that
handles the printing of select tags so
we can have arrows that are not classes
and courses that are not arrows the goal
in debugging is to find errors that
actually caused the failure</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
