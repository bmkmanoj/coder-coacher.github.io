imaging so here is an old scan probably
a I'm gonna guess CT and the image on
the left is the grayscale and then
they've thresholded the image on the
right and what you'd like to do is you'd
like to say you know there's this chunk
here and there's this chunk there and
maybe this chunk in this chunk and some
things there and that and maybe I'm
going to ignore some of that other stuff
the first thing we're gonna look at is
what's referred to as a connected
component analysis all right so some of
these are a little hard to see but we'll
just focus on this one right here it is
I'd like to pull out this thing as being
distinct say from this thing okay these
are not connected so I would like to
label this maybe as a 2 and this is a 3
all right I want to find all of the
connected components or a connected set
of pixels the connected components
algorithm or operation takes a binary
image and it generates what's referred
to as a labeled image so every pixel now
it used to be a 0 or 1 it's now getting
it a label that is the number of the
object to which it belongs alright so if
there is just one object everything will
be a 0 or 1 in the 1 right but if there
are two objects there'll be zeros ones
and twos all right by the way one of the
things that we're not going to talk
about is when we talk about a pixel
being connected to another pixel there's
what's known as 4-way connected an
eight-way connected 4-way means that
you're connected to north south east and
west
I get those right well it depends upon
which way you're looking eight way
connected says I'm connected to the
north-south east-west and I'm connected
to Northeast northwest southeast
Southwest alright for all I'm going to
show you here we're going to assume a
4-way connected the algorithm is pretty
much the same if it's eight way</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
