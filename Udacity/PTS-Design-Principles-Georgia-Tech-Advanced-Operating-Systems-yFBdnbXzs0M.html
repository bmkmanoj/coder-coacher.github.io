channel and simple primitives to
manipulate this abstraction namely get
input and these channels can be anywhere
in the distributed system just like UNIX
sockets these are named entities that
are network-wide unique and therefore
you can have a large scale distributed
computation and which channels exist
everywhere and you can discover them and
connect to them and do I owe on them
using get input all the heavy lifting
that is the systems work that needs to
happen in order to support this channel
abstraction and the operations that you
do on the channel abstractions like the
get input operations are all managed
under the covers by the runtime system
of pts so pts channels can be anywhere
just like unique sockets can be accessed
from anywhere and they are network-wide
unique and this is a similarity of the
channels to unique sockets in terms of
the ubiquity in the entire distributed
system but what makes pts channels
particularly attractive for situation
awareness applications is that the
runtime system and the AP is provided
for manipulating the channel treats time
as a first-class entity what we mean by
that is time is manipulatable by the
application in the way it specifies
items to the runtime system and it
queries a runtime system using time as
the index into the channel and that's
what is unique about the pts channels
the second unique property of the pts
abstraction is that it allows streams to
be persisted under application control
remember that these sensors are
producing data 24-7 therefore
continuously data is being produced and
all of it cannot obviously be held in
the memory of the CPU so they have to be
persisted on more
archival storage like a disk and pts
provides the ability to persist the
streams under application control the
flipside of persisting streams is that
when equity comes in for a particular
channel it is actually saying get me
items from a lower bound to an upper
bound and the lower bond maybe yesterday
which means that we are asking for data
which are historical in nature in
addition to live data so the pts runtime
system and the semantics of channels
allow seamlessly handling live and
historical data the primitives are just
get input whether we are accessing data
that is current or historical you give a
lower bound marker and an upper bound
marker and the runtime system gets to
work in doing whatever heavy lifting
that needs to be done to bring the data
that you're looking for between the
lower bond marker and the upper bond
marker so that's the power of the PTF
channel primitive it is simple to use
but at the same time it provides handles
that will make the life of the domain
expert that is developing a situation
awareness application so much easier
because it allows time to be manipulated
as a first-class entity recognized by
the programming system and it allows
persistence for data beyond the lifetime
of a computation by moving it to
archival storage under application
control and thirdly it allows for
seamlessly integrating live and
historical data</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
