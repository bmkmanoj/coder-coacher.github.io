to do it so let's dig right in here's a
game I'm playing online with my friend
Ken I'm winning by a little bit mostly
because I got good letters like the Z
and so on but Ken's catching up let's
dig right in and come up with our
concept inventory what we got well most
obvious thing there's a board there's
letters both letters on the board and
letters in the hand and the letters on
the board have to form words and in the
hand they're not there's a notion of a
legal play on on the board so ritzy is a
word and it's a word independent of
where it appears but it's legal to have
placed it here where it hooks up with
another letter and it wouldn't have been
legal to place it where it bumps into
the H or where it's not attached to
anything else there's a notion of score
and the score for individual letters Z
is worth ten and an eye is worth one and
their scores for a play where you add up
the letters and part of that is that
there are bonuses on the board dl means
double letter score a letter that's
placed there gets doubled DW means
double word score if any letter of the
word is on that square then the whole
word score is doubled and we also have
triples as well somewhere behind the
scenes there's a dictionary and all
these words are in the dictionary and
other combinations of letters are not
and then not shown here is the notion of
a blank tile part of the hand might be a
blank that isn't that isn't indicated
any particular letter but you're free to
use for anyone similar to the way we had
jokers in the game of poker</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
