number of time steps even though we have
a very simple model of just three rules
and a code that doesn't even have a
variable input it's already quite
tedious
so we're later going to introduce a
number of additional simplifications
that will give us a little more leeway
here so that we do not have to go
through this exact counting process but
still learn something about the
algorithm so in general the capabilities
of the RAM closely match what you would
expect from your own computer but of
course it's a simplification but
nevertheless it's a rather solid model
so it's difficult to design an algorithm
that when you analyze it will give you a
very different idea about its
performance than he would get on the RAM
nevertheless I think it's important to
think about the differences between a
Ram model and a normal computer and
we'll do this as a quiz so here are four
main simplifications that I think the
RAM is making so here are four
properties of the RAM the first one is
simple operations take only one time
step the second one is we assume that we
have as much memory as we need the third
one is that memory axis is considered to
be free in terms of time and the fourth
one is that a unit of memory cannot hold
an arbitrarily large number and of
course this is going to be subjective
but I would like you to tell me which of
these four properties you think is
realistic in the sense that it comes
pretty close to real computer and which
of these you would consider unrealistic
meaning if you were to run your
algorithm on a real machine then there
would be considerable differences and
again the answers to these are
subjective so if you get stuck or if you
disagree with me just click Next and see
where our opinions differ</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
