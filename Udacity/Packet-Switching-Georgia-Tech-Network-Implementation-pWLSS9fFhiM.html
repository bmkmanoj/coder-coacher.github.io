forwarding traffic is contained in the
destination address of every Datagram or
packet similar to how you would write a
letter and specify the destination to
where you want the letter sent and that
letter might wind its way through
multiple intermediate post offices and
route to the recipient packet switching
works much the same way there is no
state established ahead of time and
there are very few assumptions made
about the level of service that the
network provides this assumption about
the level of service that the network
provides is sometimes called best effort
so how does packet switching enable
sharing just as if you were sending a
letter many senders can send over the
same network at the same time
effectively sharing the resources in the
network a similar phenomenon occurs in
packet switching when multiple senders
send network traffic or packets over the
same set of shared network links now
this is in contrast to the phone network
where if you were to make a phone call
the resources for the path between you
and the recipient are dedicated and are
allocated until the phone call ends the
mode of switching that the conventional
phone network uses is called circuit
switching where a signaling protocol
sets up the entire path out-of-band so
this notion of packet switching and
statistical multiplexing allowing
multiple users to share a resource at
the same time was really revolutionary
and it is one of the underlying design
principles of the internet that has
persisted now an advantage of
statistical multiplexing of the links in
the network means that a sender never
gets a busy signal the drawbacks include
things like variable delay and the
potential for loss or dropped packets in
contrast circuit switching provides
resource control better accounting and
reservation of resources and the ability
to pin paths between a sender and
receiver packet switching provides the
ability to share resources and
potentially better resilience
