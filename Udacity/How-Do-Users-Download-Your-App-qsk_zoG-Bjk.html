questions like how do users download my
app so over here in the dashboard you
see the acquisition menu expand it new
users we see the new users for the time
period and we can scroll down to see
their locations have the app marketplace
menu option shows where users downloaded
your app and you can get a day by day
break down socom android vending is the
Play Store so here we see that most of
the downloads came from the Play Store
and then you can scroll down this page
to get the accumulated data so the
sources reports provide different but
similar views of the same data showing
where users got your app so the all
shows all the places they got the app
Google Play shows the sessions where the
users downloaded the app from Google
Play and iTunes will show a similar
thing for itunes we can look at the
Google Play referral report to see a
workflow representation of where people
came from to get to the Play Store to
install the app so Google organic we see
we had here we had 111 Play Store views
which resulted in sixty installs so to
be able to get reports like this you
need to do a couple of things so the app
must be in google play or also on iTunes
you can track conversion tracking from
itunes and you need to link your Google
Analytics account to Google Play so to
link your analytics account to Google
Play go to the Google Play page in the
dashboard and you see this information
telling you that report requires that
you link your apps with Google Play and
you can just go ahead right from here
and click setup app linking enter all
the data and right here get Google Play
Developer console later and if you're
doing iOS campaign tracking you would
also enable that one there and you save
that and now your Google Analytics
account is linked
go play for this account ID and the
steps for linking to iTunes are outlined
in the dashboard too so you can go
through those steps here if applicable
to your app and don't forget to add the
code to your app to send the download
hits whoops my bad no code needed for
android apps and that's all there is to
it now you'll be able to use google
analytics to track how people download
your app from the Play Store this course
doesn't cover deploying app to Google
Play so I'll leave you to investigate
this aspect of analytics on your own</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
