these equations that means i can
substitute negative 2x plus 4 in for y
this is my substitution step next we
distribute a positive 3 to negative two
x and positive for so i'll have negative
6 plus 12 combining like terms i'll have
negative 1x plus 12 equals 10 i have
negative 6 x's and positive 5 x's I have
more negatives than I do positives so
when i simplify here i know that i'm
going to need a negative number a
negative 1x so i have negative 1 x
equals negative 2 so if the negative of
x equals negative 2 then the positive of
X must equal positive 2 some students
think about multiplying both sides by
negative 1 and others divide by negative
1 either way is correct we know x equals
2 but we're not done we still need to
find y to find why i'm going to use one
of my original equations i've used the
first one since it looks less
complicated notice also that i didn't
choose to use this equation i might have
made a mistake when trying to find this
equation that's why it's always best to
use an original one plugging in 2 for X
I'll have 4 is equal to 4 minus y then i
can subtract 4 from both sides to
isolate my Y so 0 equals negative Y
which means 0 also equals positive Y any
number x 0 is still 0 so if we multiply
by negative 1 this should make sense the
point 2 comma 0 should be the point of
intersection if I use some mental math
real quick we can check it two times two
is four and 4-0 is for so yes this one
checks plugging in 2 for X and 0 for y
I'll have 5 times 2 which is 10 this
term would be 0 so 10 equals 10 that's
true as well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
