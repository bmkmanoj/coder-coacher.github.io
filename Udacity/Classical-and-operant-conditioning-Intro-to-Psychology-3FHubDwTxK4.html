operant conditioning separately however
they can be used together to change
behavior a perfect example of this is
the story of cali the sea lion let's go
talk to doctors elex about this she can
tell us more Kali's backstory is both
heartbreaking and inspirational so she's
the youngest of my group and she is I
believe eight years old at this point
she was one of the youngest surviving
premature baby sea lions that has ever
made it she was born more than one month
premature and her mother died of domoic
acid poisoning which is a type of toxic
algae it's a neurotoxin kali was exposed
to that toxin in in utero and has a huge
range of neurologic and gastrointestinal
problems as a result of this exposure so
it's been touch-and-go her whole life
and one of her big problems is because
of this really sort of form of brain
damage she doesn't like food so her
natural instinct is to starve herself
and we have had to use classical
conditioning actually to keep her alive
because what she does like is behavior
and people think of how she was raised
so we used behavior and people to reward
her for eating which is the opposite of
what you normally think but it's a great
testimony to what classical and operant
conditioning can do and today she's
alive and healthy so learning saved her
life learning saved her life and and she
has learned to like fish</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
