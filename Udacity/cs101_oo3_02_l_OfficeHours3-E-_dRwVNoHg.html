okay yes there was we aren't real people
yes Graham says asking a live question
produced a weird effect as by now we're
very used to hearing recorded video we
don't mistake I get also show you might
my arm is really not transparent yeah I
have to eat a lot of rice noodles to
make it transparent for the recordings
but but normally it's yeah you're saying
you had a question Graham click on OK oh
we can click on someone and well you've
suffer over the name again ok Oh
crashing oh ok uh who has a question oh
yeah ok yes I'm done where are you from
John oh hai hai jaan from New York
what's the question this is very true
yes so the question is do the homeworks
all count each question count the same
even though there's a big difference in
how hard the questions are and this is
the way things are now that every
question counts for one point and we
don't have a way to give partial credit
this is definitely a limitation of our
grading system that we would you know
there are questions that definitely
evolved a lot more work than others and
there are questions that we would like
to be able to give partial credit for
and that's probably something we'll be
able to do in future offerings of the
course at this point that's a limitation
of the way grading works yeah every
questions worth the same amount of
points I encourage people not to get too
caught up in the grading so so
definitely my hope is that you know for
the harder questions that you feel like
you've accomplished something and
learned a lot by doing it even if it's
only worth one point or even worse if
it's worth one point but because of some
quirk in the grading system where you
forget to remove a straight print or
something you don't get that point try
not to get too upset and frustrated by
that that
and the goal of the homeworks is really
really for you to learn from that and
hopefully feel that you've accomplished
something and even if you didn't get the
point because the the way it was great
you know that you actually were on the
right track and understood the things
that we wanted you to get out of that
question expanding on that question
since i since i did just kind of start
today i was wondering if the due date
mattered sure review so so the question
is since Michelle is starting late if
the due dates matter and they do in the
sense of the grades that you get from
for the homework are based on the
answers that you submit before the due
date they don't matter other than that
so you can do the homework after the
deadline if you submit them after the
deadline you see right away whether the
answer is correct so you can get all the
same learning benefit out of the
homeworks and there's also you can still
get a perfect score in the class even if
you missed the homeworks both because
one of the ways of grading now is just
counting the exam so students who join
the class late aren't able to get credit
for the early homeworks but if they
learn the material and do well on the
exam you still have a chance to get a
perfect score in the class so I you know
I hope you know students do value the
grades they get on the homeworks but
definitely if you are starting to class
late you can still do the homework still
learn from them and still have a chance
to get a perfect score in the class yeah
and part of the reason the due dates are
really good just keeping everyone
together and I mean we could be hard to
hold a session like this if we had half
her students down unifor and a third on
unit one and have another third on yeah
that's a good time that there are you
know online classes you can do
completely at your own pace and for many
people that works well for other people
without having the pressure of a
deadline and the community experience of
going through a course at the same time
and being able to do something like
we're doing now with live office hours
you really missed that experience and
it's it's much harder to keep up with
the course if you don't have deadlines
um but we don't want people to feel like
they're drop out of the course because
you miss one deadline because you
weren't
to get the grade on that homework so so
definitely the deadlines if they're
helpful for you to take the deadline
seriously take the deadline seriously
but it's really not required to take the
deadline set seriously there's a text
question about using third-party
libraries for web bittleman okay so this
is a text question for me and this is
also a oh good points that our goal in
this class is to teach computer science
concepts and we were using the goal of
building a search engine as a vehicle
for doing that if your real goal was
just to build the best search engine you
could then you'd be much better off
using existing libraries and putting
them together rather than learning how
to build your own extracting a link
function say what we did in unit 1 so
it's definitely a trade-off and the
trade-off we're making here is to learn
computer science concepts if your goal
was to just build the search engine as
quickly as you could the way we're doing
in class would not be that the best way
to do that okay ah good enough ask are
there plans to cover robots.txt okay so
this was a good question i hope you saw
it the interview with anna patterson at
the end of unit 3 where she talks about
how important is to be polite in a real
web crawler someone did ask on the forms
what it means to be polite Oh calm so
that by how computer how can computer be
polite to another yes and politeness is
I'm glad that Anna used the word polite
because it's not the normal word people
would would use but it's actually a good
way to think about it that you know just
like when people interact you're not
supposed to interrupt people or yell at
them all the time that's impolite to do
that when computers interact with other
computers well they're not people
getting offended in the same way but if
you do the kinds of things that are rude
when people do them they cause problems
for the other computers so if you're
sending requests as fast as you can at
the same server and trying to crawl that
entire server and sending
a request to it well that's really rude
right that's taking resources away from
the surplus money it's costing the
server operator money and it's
preventing people who actually want to
get the content because they're looking
for that page from getting so to be a
good citizen on the web if you're
writing a web crawler you have to follow
up follow rules and limit the resources
that you take from the servers that
you're crawling and robots.txt is a file
that servers can put on the server that
says here's rules about how you should
crawl this server so it might give a
rate limit it might say don't crawl
these pages it might say how often can
you read sometimes that's sort of like
privacy reasons yeah it could be for
privacy it could be for resource use it
could be you know there's pages on the
site that they don't want to end up in
and index and a well behaved web crawler
will always check this before requesting
any other pages from the site for the
crawler that we built in this class
we're not doing that and the reason
we're not doing that is our goal is to
make things as simple as possible and to
understand as much computer science the
work of sort of reading the robots that
text file understanding what's in it
regulating the crawler well that would
be hundreds of lines of code and the
entire web crawler that we're building
by the very end of this class will be
less than 70 lines of code and Simon our
goal is to really make it so you
understand everything that's going on in
the core web crawler and the search
engine that's all included in the semi
lines but not need to get into a lot of
the details that if you are building a
real web crawler it'd be important to
get into the good part of this is at
least if you're running the code through
our server you don't have to worry about
politeness because we're not actually
allowing any of the programs you submit
to make arbitrary web requests all the
responses that you get are just for the
test pages that we have cashed the
results for at our server so when you
submit code even if it uses get Paige to
request pages it's not actually sending
out real web requests so it's being
point yes do we want to take does
someone have a question someone is yeah
have a question who's a nun typing
question go for it
no one all right okay go ahead folks
yeah we have another type 1 we got where
the name that's a neat I'm photo/matt
okay sis but like we shove sarkar what's
to know where did the name Udacity come
from and so it came it has a couple
different possibilities the most obvious
one so so there's a word audacity which
means boldness daring and we removed a
from audacity to get Udacity we like it
starting with you because that sounds
like a university the city sort of also
sounds like University so that's that's
where the name came from I know some
people hate it some people like it it's
the name we're gonna use so i hope
everyone comes to like it yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
