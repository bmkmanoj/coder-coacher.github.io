that we know the diagnosis is an
instance of abduction let us ask
ourselves how does this understanding
help us in choosing hypotheses so the
first principle for choosing a
hypothesis is explanatory coverage a
hypothesis must cover as much of the
data as possible here is an example
hypothesis H 3 explained data items d 12
d 8 hypothesis H 7 explains data item D
52 d 9 assuming that all of these data
elements are equally important equally
salient we may prefer h3 487 because it
explains more of the data that does H
them the second principle for choosing
between competing hypotheses is called
the principle of parsimony all things
being equal we want to pick the simplest
explanation for the data so consider the
following scenario h2 explains data
elements d12 d3 export explains data
elements d1 through d 8 at six explains
data elements d for 2d six and its eight
explains data elements d 72 d 9 now if
you went by the criteria of expiratory
coverage then we might pick h2 + 86 + 88
because the three of them combined
explained more than just 804 however the
criteria of parsimony would suggest if
we pick it for because it for alone
explains almost all the data and we
don't need the other three hypotheses in
general this is a balancing act between
these two principles we want to both
maximize the coverage and maximize the
parsimony does in this particular
example you may go with h 4 + h eight
you two together explain all the data
and in addition the set of these two
hypotheses is smaller than the set of
hypothesis h 2 86 and 88 the third
criteria for choosing between competing
hypotheses that we want to pick those
hypotheses in which we have more
confidence some hypotheses are more
likely than others you may have more
confidence in some hypotheses than in
others as an example in this particular
scenario x3 may explain data items
2d eight and if I may explain more data
elements from d12 d9 so x5 also explains
d9 that a tree does it however we may
have more confidence in h3 and so we may
pick h3 instead of 85 once again this is
a balancing act between these three
criteria for choosing between competing
diagnostic hypotheses a quick point to
note here these we criteria useful for
choosing between competing hypotheses
even if the task is not diagnosis the
same problem occurs for example in
intelligence analysis imagine that you
have some data that needs to be
explained and you've competing
hypotheses were explaining that
particular data well you may pick
between the competing hypotheses based
on this criteria although the task is
not a diagnostic task these two criteria
are useful for explanation diagnosis
simply happens to be an example of
explanatory task</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
