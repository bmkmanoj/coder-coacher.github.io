and we typically use a disc or a square
that can you can oh you can also smooth
contours but it'll typically break thin
connections eliminate small islands so
small little spurious things also
sometimes eliminate some sharp peaks the
closing can smooth contours where the at
the concavities it'll fuse narrow break
so things that were supposed to be
connected with but had a little hole in
them it'll it'll do that and it can sort
of fill in these gulfs so often you'll
do one followed by the other alright so
here's an example this is the original
image okay and it's it's a fake image
obviously just to make the point so
here's our original image and you'll
notice it has you know this cutout here
that these rough edges here this kind of
noise here these spurious things there
and the opening alright does exactly
what you think it'll eat away this stuff
this stuff that stuff and that stuff
alright and also these little ridges up
here a closing all right well what
that's gonna do is that'll fill in this
hole so that's gone there fill in that
whole thing so that's gone there and
fill in these things there okay remember
neither opening or closing are gonna
grow or shrink things right they're not
erosions a titillations one is a
dilation followed by an erosion which
ones that that's a closed and the other
one is an erosion followed by the Latian
that's an open well when you do an
opening followed by a closing okay so
you take this and then you close that
you get rid of this you get rid of this
you get it you get the two underlying
elements okay so the idea is that that
was what you really wanted all right and
these kinds of operations are what we
use often so to show you a real-life
example of that here's a finger print
example here's the original image you
hear the ridges that you want to find
there's a whole bunch of spots you don't
want to find there are some gaps that
are not real right there and so what
they do is they apply an opening
followed by a closing and you get this
really nice fingerprint image okay so
that's an example of
doing it for real something I'm not
going to talk about now there's
something called a hit or miss transform
it's basically how to find a particular
shape by the way uh Linda Shapiro I
think I think that since appear on
stockman or another book the Linnet was
associated with had in their textbook
they have a whole bunch of stuff on
morphology so if you need to know more
of the details you can go get that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
