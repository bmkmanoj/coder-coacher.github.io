formulas so what is the sad problem the
sad problem has an input a boolean
formula with n variables and I'm usually
going to write them as x1 x2 and so on
until you get to xn and the output or
questions since Sat is a decision
problem is the following and the
question is can you set the variables x1
to xn to a combination of true or false
so that the whole formula that you're
given in the input becomes true and the
answer to that can of course only be yes
or no so again set is a decision problem
so for example if we're given a very
simple boolean formula such as x1 and x2
and then the answer to that would be yes
because you said it could set x1 to true
and x2 to true and then the whole
formula would also evaluate to true
because you have 1 + 1 which is true or
1 let's do a little bit more challenging
example if you had a boolean formula
such as this X 1 and X 2 or 1 and not x1
or x2 and what you can also see here is
that you do not always have to put
brackets around each or to signify in
which order you evaluate the individual
ones so it's ok to write two or three or
four ORS or two or three or four ands or
even more if you want to without doing
those those brackets it doesn't really
make a difference in the way that the
formula evaluates but let's come back to
that
so does this boolean formula here have a
satisfying assignment meaning can you
set the variables to a combination of
true and false so that the whole formula
becomes true and here the answer is
again yes x1 unfortunately doesn't
really help here so if you set x1 to
true for example this would also be true
and here you have not x1 so x1 and not X
1 that would evaluate to 0 if you set x1
to 0 then you have it the other way
around and then let's set X 2 to 1
because then this whole thing here is 1
this stays at 0 no matter what we do
and this one also goes to one and then
you have one or zero or one so there's
at least one one in here and so the
whole thing evaluates to 1 and the
formula can be satisfied so now let's
see if you can figure out an even more
challenging example yourself so here's
our boolean formula X 1 or X 3 and X 1
and X 2 or not X 3 and the formula
continues here not X 2 or not X 3 and
not X 1 or not X 2 and I'm going to
reveal to you that this formula and it
has an assignment of true and false to
the variables X 1 X 2 and X 3 so that
the whole formula is satisfied meaning
it evaluates to true what I want to know
from you is how I have to set the
variables to do this so if I should set
x1 to false
please check here if I should set it to
true please check here and the same
thing for the variables x2 and x3 please</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
