think you want to come up with at least
a couple of things first if there's
content in this event you want to learn
at least one thing that's relevant for
your business and so you want to go to a
networking event that you can hopefully
learn something relevant for you but the
most important thing is trying to figure
out specific individuals there that
would be good for your business are they
other investors that can help you are
you looking for a co-founder it's really
about trying to be trying to tell your
story in a very sustained way so the
person across from you will understand
what you do and hopefully connect I
think it's not about quality quantity
it's with a bad quality don't try to
shake hands with a hundred different
people for one second try to find those
five six seven people that there's a
chance that they will dramatically
influence the trajectory of your startup
because they join you as an employee
wise investor or perhaps connect you to
somebody who can be that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
