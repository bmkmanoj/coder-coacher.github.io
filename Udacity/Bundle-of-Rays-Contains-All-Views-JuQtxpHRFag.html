bundle of rays okay basically again
remember what we are interested in is
rays of light that we want to capture in
a camera bundle of rays basically
implies is that at any point in the
scene basically it's a concentric set of
rays of light hitting that scene at this
point so in essence all rays of light
are converging to this specific point in
my world of course what I have is a
camera at this point I can now do
variety of things I can actually rotate
this camera just at one point so we can
generalize this motion by this curved
arrow here so what I mean by a bundle of
rays basically now is nothing else but
at this point we are going to get a
concentric set of arrays of light and
here I've just put them equidistant to
just kind of show that all light is
converging at this point here and what I
did by rotating the camera at this point
was try to capture all of them of course
you know these rays of light could be
coming in all directions let's not look
at a specific types of views to help us
understand this so for example this is
my first view I have a subject here and
I basically use the camera here and
basically now I get these bundles of
rays coming into my camera of course I
could also have another view right the
camera was pointing this way this is my
view this is my normal from both sides
here and I now have two views so the
question comes up is if I have these two
views can I create a synthetic view that
basically is in between both of them
which exactly does have the same points
that I have here so this point here is
also visible in this image here and
these points are also visible here so by
just combining these two can I now
generate a new view a synthetic view so
the belief is that is possible to
generate any synthetic view of a camera
as long as it has some center of
projection this one so as long as I keep
my camera this center of projection
and if I do get this view and that will
I can synthesize this one and this is
something that's important to note and
that's one of the reasons when we talk
about panoramas we want to actually
rotate them around one single point
either actually have them have a path
like this or just at this point rotate
our camera like this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
