first if P equals NP would that mean
that every computational problem could
be solved in polynomial time well no
actually it wouldn't first of all their
problems that simply can't be solved it
turns out which we'll get to later in
the course but even if we restrict
ourselves to problems that can actually
be solved by a computer there are still
problems that would not be solvable in
polynomial time in fact we mentioned an
example of this in an earlier assignment
where if you wanted to print out all the
sub lists of lists then necessarily that
means that it will execute an
exponential time not polynomial time
because you have to print out every
single possible sub list and that's a
case where the if-better construction
doesn't actually help you out so this is
not the case however the next one is
true if P were not equal to NP and we
proved this then that would mean that no
NP complete problems could be solved in
polynomial time that's in fact part of
the definition of P naught equal to NP
and for the next one this is also
actually true this is a little tricky
and somewhat subjective depending on
what you mean by easier here but it's
certainly the case that despite NP
complete problems all being in some
sense as hard as each other we might
care about a certain subset of instances
of problem that for whatever reason are
easier to solve in practice then another
problem might be and that really depends
on what in practice you are concerned
about and which instances of a problem
that tend to come up in practice and for
the fourth one this is not true the
ability to solve some instances of an
np-complete problem does not imply that
P equals NP for example you can find the
clique or a click or a minimum vertex
cover to of an empty graph relatively
easily it's well nothing because they're
the empty graph has no vertices and no
edges that's an example of an instance
that you can quite possibly always solve
or you should always be able to solve
very quickly but that doesn't mean that
you can solve all in
and for p equal NP we really have to
concern ourselves with every single
possible instance of a problem and
that's really where NP becomes quite
complicated and finally showing a
problem is np-complete means it can't be
solved in polynomial time well no in
order to do this we would actually have
to show that NP is not in P or rather P
does not equal NP that's really the
problem we're talking about here in not
so many words so just being np-complete
isn't enough we also have to prove that
P does not equal NP</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
