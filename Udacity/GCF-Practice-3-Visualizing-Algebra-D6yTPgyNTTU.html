negative 35 is just five that's going to
start the product from my GCF now I want
the lowest power of X that is common
between all the terms well just one x is
common between all the terms the lowest
power of Y that is common is too so y
squared would also appear in my GCF and
finally I look at the lowest power of Z
between all the terms but have to be
careful there's no Z over here so Z
won't be included in my GCF so we'll
factor out a 5 X Y squared from each of
these terms I'll need three XY squared Z
cubed for the first term for z to the
5th for the second term and negative x
squared Y for the last term I can do
this pretty quickly if I just check the
multiplication as I go 5 times 3 is 15 x
times X is x squared + y squared times y
squared is y to the 4th of course I also
have this Z cubed on the end so this is
my first term when I multiply these two
terms together I get 20 X Y squared z to
the 5th the variables are just listed or
multiplied together and 5 times 4 is 20
finally I know this last term must be
correct 5 times negative 7 is negative
35 + x times x squared is X cubed the
last variable is y cubed which comes
from Y squared times y so yeah this is
definitely my factored form</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
