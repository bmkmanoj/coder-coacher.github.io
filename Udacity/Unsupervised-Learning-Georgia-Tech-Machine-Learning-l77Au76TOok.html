to clustering and
expectation-maximization I don't know
it's a little drama might help kind of
wake us up this morning
how you doing Charles I'm doing fine I
just had a lotta ice cream dude you
really should need ice cream first thing
in the morning well the first thing in
the morning that was after I had a
muffin and a breakfast burrito so it was
third thing in the morning you
frightened me as you may recall the mini
course that we're doing now is on
unsupervised learning and we haven't
really kind of sat down and introduced
these concepts so I thought it might be
worth taking a step back even though
we're gonna talk about some particular
algorithms today to talk more generally
about what unsupervised learning is so
up to this point in the first mini
course we talked about supervised
learning supervised learning in
supervised learning we use labeled
training data to generalize labels to
new instances and what unsupervised
learning is is making sense out of
unlabeled data so when I wrote these
down I started to think boy they're more
different than you'd expect just by
sticking an uninformed how so well they
don't seem to really the definitions
don't seem to have all that much in
common you know it's not like this one
uses label training data to generalize
labels to new instances and this one
uses unlabeled training data to
generalize labels to new instances like
I would think that you'd have the
definition of one you just take an extra
one in there well it's kind of true
right so you if you if you do some data
description and make sense out of
unlabeled data and then I give you a new
piece of data somehow using that
description you would know how to
describe it maybe I mean there's
definitely some some unsupervised
learning algorithms that do some amount
of generalization but but it's it's not
as it's not as unified I think in some
sense the concern here is that
unsupervised learning is just not as
unified a problem or as well defined or
crisply defined a problem as supervised
learning you know I think that's a
definitely sure so just as labels and I
think we talked about this in the intro
to the whole course that supervised
learning we can sometimes think of as
function approximation which is learning
how to map inputs to outputs
whereas unsupervised learning is data
description it's about taking the data
that you've got and fine
some kind of more compact way of
describing it sure about that and that
makes a lot of sense</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
