agent might actually do the processing
using these primitive actions so
consider the sentence John push the cart
the AI agent begins left your right
because we're talking about English
language here the first word here John
is not a verb so the a agent for the
time being puts this in a list of
concepts and ignores it it comes to the
second word in the sentence which is
pushed there's a verb here push and now
the AI agent uses this particular verb
push as a probe into its long-term
memory so now the frame for propel is
going to get pulled out let's see what
the fray might look like so here is the
frame for propel that has been pulled
out of the long-term memory and this
frame tells us that we can expect an
agent we can expect an object and indeed
although we have not shown here this
frame may have additional slots and
perhaps additional things can be
expected now for each of these slots
there is a rule buried in here a rule
which tells us how can we pull out from
a sentence the entity that goes under
the slot the filler that must go here so
here is a rule which says that if there
is an concept just before the verb and
that concept is any made then whatever
that concept is put it here well there
is a concept just before push that's
John and let's suppose that we have a
lexicon which tells us if John is any
weight then put John here similarly
there is a rule here for this slot which
does the agent that if there is a object
there is a concept that comes after this
verb and that particular concept refers
to an object it is in animate then take
that particular thing and put it here
and that's the cart and so we put cart
here so this way this particular scheme
helps us derive the meaning of John push
the cart and notice that the processing
is a combination a bottom-up and
top-down as we discussed earlier it
begins bottom-up because we are looking
at the data right now we don't have
knowledge but as soon as some data is
processed it pulls in knowledge from
memory and soon the processing become
stop down it this frame helps the
generate expectations and he'll pull
things out this is almost acting like a
hook for a fish so once you have the
hook then you can capture the fish well
other things to be noted here first
representations like these first
representations like this are called
structured knowledge representations
there is not any representation here
there is a strong structure to it
earlier when we were discussing
predicates and logic are we discussing
rules and antecedent and consequent of
rules they are like the atoms of
knowledge representation they don't have
much structure but by now we have this
molecule of forms of knowledge
representation in which a large number
of atoms are getting connected with each
other and those connections are
important because once you have that
structure of the molecule it tells you
what can go in the place of each atom
second this is a simple sentence and so
the processing was quite simple these
sentences need not always be as simple
as this one what happens if the sentence
has a world push in it and I pick a
frame that is not the right frame for it
suppose I had pulled out a frame for
move object instead of propel here well
one possibility is that if I were to
select a different frame for making
sense of this particular sentence then
as I try to fill the slots of this
particular frame I will find a lot of
difficulty in which case I might abandon
that frame and try a different one the
second possibility is that I may even
force the interpretation of this do the
slots or the other frame but if there is
a story here which contains large number
of sentences then soon I realize that
that is not the right frame I may
abandon it and pick a different frame so
for complex sentences this processing is
not as linear as we have pretended it to
be right here it is also possible that
sometimes one of these words they map
into two frames equally well indeed this
is the basis of many of the puns that we
encounter so consider I was wondering
why the ball was becoming bigger then it
hit me now you of course I understand
the word hit there that particular word
maps into two different interpretations
and that's why it is interesting and
funny so here is another one two men
walked into the bar the third one ducks
now hear the word the bar is overloaded
so here walked into the bar is getting
interpreted in two different ways indeed
people have tried tubule accounts of
humor based on the
so story interpretation that we are
doing here could it be that this is the
beginning of a theory of humor of how
you can tell stories not onto your
machines</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
