might improve it I know you're thinking
ASCII Chan is probably perfect already
but that's not true we can make it
better when a user makes a request to
ASCII Chan we have to do a number of
things first thing we have to do is we
have to process the request this
basically means parsing the HTTP you
know parsing the URL you know doing the
the URL mapping to the to the right
handler you know just kind of all of
that overhead before our program
actually starts to run you know figuring
out what what we're going to do with
this request that takes some amount of
time you know it doesn't feel like a lot
of time because it's actually not right
now but if you're processing millions
and millions of requests yeah all that
little all the time would add up the
next thing we do which is much more
substantial is we query the database you
know we have ASCII Chan our program and
then we have our our database that is
full of ASCII art of little animals and
stuff you know our program makes a
request to the database which runs and
gives us our response depending on the
complexity of this query this can take a
lot of time not to mention it may not be
free if if we're doing so many queries
that app engine starts charging us that
can be a big factor the next thing we do
in a request is we collate the results
you know we may have to do some sorting
we may have to prune some of the results
out because there spam you know it's all
sorts of things we have to do to
manipulate the results we have to
convert them into these Python Mod
Python objects from the from our
database results all that little
maintenance stuff to get ready to
actually render our HTML and then
finally we render our HTML now if
there's lots of HTML this can actually
take a lot of time you know on Reddit
the actual time rendering all of that
content all that HTML was non-trivial
and that required some optimization now
an ASCII Chan things are pretty simple
but you know like I said every websites
a little bit different so what I would
like you to do now just a quick quiz to
interrupt things is which of these four
tasks given you know you understand the
nature of ASCII Chan you've you know
your blog has almost the exact same
structure as ASCII Chan you know users
submit things always display a list of
these things which of these items do you
think is the best place to start when
we're
looking to improve our website</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
