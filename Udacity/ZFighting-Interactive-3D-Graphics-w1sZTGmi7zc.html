most part it solves the problem of two
surfaces being in the same location
however it does change the geometry of
the model which might not be acceptable
also even surfaces that are near each
other can still have Z fighting problems
since the z-buffer has limits on its
precision so this solution works but is
not optimal the second solution sounds
nice a new graphics card is always fun
but it doesn't help at all since both
surfaces are in an identical location
which one happens to be closer is
entirely arbitrary another GPU can and
will give you a different view of Z
fighting so even if you like the Z
fighting effect you can't control it if
your users are in different machines
with different GPUs the third answer is
switching to another rendering algorithm
again we'll just cause different
precision errors to show up the
underlying problem of two surfaces being
in the same place is a modelling error
and can't be solved by rendering the
fourth dancer removing the bottom part
of the leg that overlaps with the foot
is certainly the cleanest solution this
is also the most efficient answer as
making the object smaller will mean it
covers less pixels and so causes less
work</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
