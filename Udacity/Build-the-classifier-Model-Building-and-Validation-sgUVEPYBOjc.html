let's switch back to the ipython
notebook to recall briefly we have
chosen person one as b + % 2 as f and we
are going to classify them according to
their location patterns we did a final
sanity check to ensure that the features
chosen actually seem to have
discriminating power at this point let's
run this piece of code what it does is
it fills an array named classification
events with the events of person B and
person f we are now going to split the
data in a training set and a test set in
this case we are going to use sixty
percent of the data on training and
forty percent on test let's go ahead and
do that first at this point we have
split the data into training and test
sets we are using a large portion of the
data for testing as we will be
illustrating several validation metrics
on the test data just as a sanity check
we want to plot our features within our
training data once you have run the
above code you should get histograms for
the distribution of different distances
at a certain time for each person
remember we wanted to make three
different classifiers to do so we have
now split our data set into the training
and the test set we also ask a quick
question are the features different
enough in the training data set we
validated that again by looking at the
histogram of the different features so
now we are ready to run the three
classification models let's get back to
the ipython notebook again in this part
of the code we are setting up the three
models for our classification problems
we are using the side kid learns
logistic regression support vector
classifier and the random forest
classifier this method here simply
returns the model that we want to train
so now let's run this code after you're
done with defining the three more
let's simply build the models it's as
simple as this one line of code let's
run it and there you have it we have the
models built in the following videos we
will use some of psychic learns built-in
model validation metrics to give us the
performance of these models before that
let us define some of the quantities we
might want to look at when evaluating
the performance of classifiers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
