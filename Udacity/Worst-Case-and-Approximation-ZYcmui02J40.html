widely based on the specific
implementations we normally use
approximations when talking about
efficiency in Big O notation since the
efficiency of the pseudocode we wrote
before could end up looking like any of
these and even more we would say that
the efficiency is actually about Big O
of n if you're writing code for
production you definitely care about the
number of computations and want to
minimize it however in an interview your
interviewer doesn't care that you can do
that exactly but just wants to know that
you are thinking about efficiency and
can calculate it if you need to by
approximating we're really saying some
number of computations must be performed
for each letter in the input there's
actually more things you should consider
when using Big O notation if you notice
before I said you'll need at least 26
checks to get through every letter of
the alphabet in reality it's unlikely
that you'll have to go through all 26
letters each time when we're discussing
efficiency we often talk about it in
terms of the worst case scenario where
we would have to check all 26 letters
each time we focus on worst case because
it puts an upper bound on the amount of
time our code is going to take you could
also talk about efficiency in terms of
the average case or even best case so if
we're talking about letters in the
alphabet the worst case means we would
have to go through all 26 letters
however the best case would be that we
find what we're looking for on the very
first try but on average we're gonna
fall somewhere in the middle around 13
in a perfect world iterating through a
list of letters is gonna take an average
of 13 times sometimes it'll be a little
more sometimes it'll be a little less
but it's fair to say it'll be about 13
if we're going to try and calculate the
average case efficiency it's going to
look a little more like this
in the end we'll get 16 n plus 2 now
let's go back to our point about
approximations if we consider the after
case the worst case or the best case
it's all still gonna result in Big O of
n in an interview you might be tempted
to combine the average case the worst
case the best case and just give an
answer like this however the best case
the worst case and the average case
might not always approximate this nicely
so you really should specify to your
interviewer which case you're talking
about we've been talking a lot about
time efficiency but you can actually use
the same notation to refer to space
efficiency too for example let's say you
needed to copy over your input string
three times in your code for some reason
then the space efficiency would look
something like this
space efficiency is asked less
frequently in interviews but it's
definitely something you should consider
because it will come up from time to
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
