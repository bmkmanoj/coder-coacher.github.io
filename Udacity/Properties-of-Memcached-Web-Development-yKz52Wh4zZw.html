memcached and one of the things that
makes a difference from a normal
database is it stores everything in
memory that's why it's so fast because
reading from memory is very fast reading
from disk can be very slow which gives
memcached a couple of properties one is
that it's fast too is that if you
restart memcached you lose all your data
so it's not durable you know if you have
to restart that machine i'll restart mem
cache the data isn't on disk it's just
in memory and it and it's and it
disappears so you need to keep that in
mind that memcached is really just for
caching not for storing permanent data
finally the amount of data we can store
it in a particular instance of memcache
is limited by how much memory that
machine has or maybe you have a system
of machines in your memcache library is
balancing over them you can still only
store so much data so what happens when
you try to store more data then there is
memory available and let's do this in
the form of a quiz now I know I haven't
told you the answer to this but see if
you can figure it out one of these
answers is correct and I'll explain
after you give a shot</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
