to talk about two costs the first is
step complexity and the second is work
complexity so as an example here we have
eight elements that we'd like to combine
using this tree style structure and so
we're going to try to characterize the
number its of steps that it's going to
take us through this computation as well
as the total amount of work so first
we're gonna look at the number of steps
we see that it's going to take us three
steps to finish this first step here
we'll do four operations the second step
can be done in parallel with two
operations and then the third step is a
final operation to get a final result
but we can also count the total amount
of work that we've done here we've done
one two three four five six seven
operations so we'd say this step
complexity is three and the word
complexity is 7 so we'll compare the
step and work complexity of the parallel
implementations that we develop against
the step and work complexity for a
serial implementation and one more piece
of terminology we will say that a
parallel algorithm is work efficient if
it's work complexity is asymptotically
the same so within a constant factor as
the work complexity of the sequential
algorithm now if we can reduce the step
complexity in our parallel
implementation compared to the serial
implementation while still having a
reasonable work complexity that isn't
too expensive we expect that this will
lead to faster runtime overall so the
real key here is to formulate the most
efficient parallel algorithm and that's
the focus of this lecture in the next
lecture</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
