that you may have thought of other
examples as well but packet filter is
one thing that I mentioned already to
you and this is something that may be a
critical component of performance for
any operating system and therefore it
might install a packet filter for
demultiplexing incoming Network package
so that exokernel can hand packets
intended for a particular library
operating system but running this code
on behalf of the library operating
system a second example would be things
that a library would like exokernel to
do on its behalf even when it is not
currently scheduled for instance a
garbage collection mechanism for an
application it's something that a
library operating system may want to be
run on behalf of it and that's something
that can be installed as a code that is
downloaded into exokernel and executed
on behalf of that library operating
system so these are all examples you may
have thought of other examples as well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
