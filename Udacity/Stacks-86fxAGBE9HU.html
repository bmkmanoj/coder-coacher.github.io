clients there'll be times when there are
many emails that have arrived on a
handheld you would show notification
that looks like this using inbox style
when you touch the notification it would
open up on the email client and show you
all the emails on a wearable you would
like to see some more information about
the emails without having to pull out
the handheld device it's possible to
create a series of notifications one
free gmail and then stack or group them
together the notifications are initially
shown as a single card that can be
expanded into multiple cards by touching
it so here we create a separate
notification for each email our app
knows about you can see that we add the
sender here and the subject here free
gmail now we use a set group method to
specify a unique key for this group so
Android wear nose which notifications
should be stacked together we then issue
this like any other notification and
here is another notification for a
second email you'll notice the use of
set group here just like the previous
one and we should this notification in
the same way as well the final step is
to create the notification for the phone
like is shown here clearly we don't want
the individual emails to each get a
notification on the handheld device this
code sample creates the inbox style
shown in the previous image it adds a
summary of all the emails in a nice
format that's perfect for showing on a
handheld device the interesting part is
the call to set group here and set group
summary here this makes the notification
part of the previous group but we've
specified that this is the summary of
the group by passing true here summary
is shown on the phone while the other
group items are shown on the Android
wear device</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
