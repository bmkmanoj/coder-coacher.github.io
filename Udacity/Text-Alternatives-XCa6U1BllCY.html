fit images we can use the old attribute
to provide a text alternative for images
however we need to think about what role
and image pleasing the page to work out
what type of text alternative it should
have let's have another look at this
newspaper page from the previous lesson
I've got voiceover running and I'm going
to use the mouse pointer moves voiceover
cursor option to let me quickly inspect
things voiceover now you probably don't
want this on all of the time but it can
be good for quickly testing things
Shadowhunter alright so here we have a
picture of a cat illustrating that
article on cats voiceover announces this
has won 16 to 0 for 9 3 4 5 6 year old
cat okay so that was pretty suboptimal I
can pull up devtools on the image and
add an alt attribute which says a cat
staring menacingly off into space
alright so now i can try voiceover again
and now you hear a nice extinct
description of the image and move on to
the article a couple of comments on the
alt attribute all allows you to specify
a simple string to be used whenever an
image is not available whether the image
fails to load like it has here or your
web crawling bot or a screen reader user
all differs from any other type of
caption including a title in that it
will only be used if the image isn't
available caption or title typically
provides extra contacts for the image
rather than an alternative to the image
writing useful alt text is a bit of an
art in order for a string to be usable
text alternative it needs to convey the
same thing as the image in the given
context to give a more complex example
we have that logo image in the masthead
link that link is going to take us back
to the homepage so it might be tempting
to write home here that's not a
functional alternative to the image it's
actually going to create a more
confusing experience because then we
might get the idea that it's an image of
some kind of home instead we can
describe this image pretty accurately
simply as the Funyun you may might not
want to explicitly call out that it's a
logo but given its an image that's more
or less implied anyway
an easy way to check whether your old
text is sensible is to imagine all your
images broken can you still understand
the page content now there's one image I
left in here that I'd like to take a
closer look at we have this magnifying
glass logo inside the search link if I
check that out with voiceover I can hear
that we've helpfully added an alt text
of magnifying glass but if I inspect the
link as a whole we can it is actually
redundant magnifying glass search
doesn't convey anything that search
doesn't far we know that if we leave the
old text out we'll probably hear the
image file name which we already saw as
a potentially horrible experience so in
this case I'm going to use an empty alt
text and we'll see what that does the
mdl tax actually removes the image from
the accessibility tree all together so
the image is now completely skipped by
the screen reader in this case that's
actually what we want because the image
what's redundant</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
