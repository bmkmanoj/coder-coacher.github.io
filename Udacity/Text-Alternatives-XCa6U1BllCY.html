for images we can use the alt attribute
to provide a text alternative for images
however we need to think about what role
an image plays in the page to work out
what type of text alternative it should
have let's have another look at this
newspaper page from the previous lesson
I've got voiceover running and I'm gonna
use the mouse pointer moves voiceover
cursor option to let me quickly inspect
things voiceover they probably don't
want this on all of the time but it can
be good for quickly testing things
alright so here we have a picture of a
cat illustrating that article on cats
voiceover announces this has a so that
was pretty suboptimal I can pull up dev
tools on the image and add an alt
attribute which says a cat staring
menacingly off into space alright so now
I can try voice over again and now hear
a nice extinct description of the image
and move on to the article a couple of
comments on the alt attribute all allows
you to specify a simple string to be
used whenever an image is not available
whether the image fails to load like it
has here or your web crawling bot or a
screen reader all differs from any other
type of caption including a title in
that it will only be used if the image
isn't available caption or title
typically provides extra context for the
image rather than an alternative to the
image writing useful alt text is a bit
of an art in order for a string to be
usable text alternative it needs to
convey the same thing as the image in
the given context to give a more complex
example we have that logo image in the
masthead link that link is gonna take us
back to the home page so it might be
tempting to write home here if that's
not a functional alternative to the
image it's actually going to create a
more confusing experience because then
we might get the idea that it's an image
of some kind of home instead we can
describe this image pretty accurately
simply as the Funyun you may might not
want to explicitly call out that it's a
logo but given it's an image that's more
or less implied anyway
an easy way to check whether your alt
text is sensible is to imagine all your
images broken can you still understand
the page content
now there's one image I left in here
that I'd like to take a closer look at
you have this magnifying glass logo
inside the search link if I check that
out with voiceover I can hear that we've
helpfully added an alt text of
magnifying glass but if I inspect the
link as a whole we can get is actually
redundant magnifying glass search
doesn't convey anything that search
doesn't follow we know that if we leave
the old text out we'll probably hear the
image filename which we already store as
a potentially horrible experience so in
this case I'm going to use an empty alt
text and we'll see what that does the
MDL text actually removes the image from
the accessibility tree all together so
the image is now completely skipped by
the screen reader in this case that's
actually what we want because the image
what's redundant</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
