to this short course on JavaScript
promises every web developer needs to be
able to handle asynchronous work with
confidence and ease and that's why
you're here you're here to take
advantage of native JavaScript promises
there are many methods to handle
asynchronous work already
however as you'll be discovering in this
course promises are the recommended
option because they give you flexibility
intuitive syntax and easy air handling
but before we start all that I have an
off topic question for you
you're looking at millions of stars in
the disk of our Milky Way galaxy every
dot is a star some are bigger and
brighter than the Sun others smaller and
dimmer but what else is in this picture
planets every single star in the Milky
Way is the possible home for dozens of
alien worlds that means it's likely that
there are hundreds of billions of
planets in our galaxy alone the Kepler
space observatory has found more than
1,000 exoplanets like this one in the
last few years combined with data from
other telescopes and astronomers have
confirmed sightings of almost 2,000
exoplanets that's a lot of worlds I had
an idea when I was designing this class
and I call it the exoplanet Explorer
it's a web app that helps people learn
about real planets around other stars
throughout this class you'll be using
promises to request real JSON data about
exoplanets and that data is coming from
NASA and Caltech you'll be using
promises to turn that data into useful
information in the app are you ready to
get started</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
