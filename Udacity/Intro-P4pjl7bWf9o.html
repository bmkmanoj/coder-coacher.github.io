really excited to have you on board
my name is Katie and I'm the one who
will be explaining most of the concepts
throughout this course I'll also be
doing a lot of drawing and a lot of
writing to help you understand the
content as much as possible in each of
the sixteen lessons in this course
you'll learn new methods to describe and
analyze data each lesson builds on the
concepts you learned before so as you
progress through the course try to get a
good grasp of the material before moving
on but if it turns out you need a review
no big deal you can easily go back and
re-watch the videos and redo the
exercises what do I mean by exercises
each lesson consists of short
instructional videos where I explain
cool stat stuff and guide your thinking
but we want you to make breakthroughs on
your own so instead of just telling you
a fact or formula we'll ask a quiz a
quiz or exercise same thing is not there
for us to judge you or to impact your
grade it's there for your own benefit to
make you think at udacity we believe
that the chance to think about something
from your own unique perspective is a
powerful learning opportunity</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
