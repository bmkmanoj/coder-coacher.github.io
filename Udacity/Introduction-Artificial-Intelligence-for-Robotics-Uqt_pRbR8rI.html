for robotics you are entering an
exciting seven weeks class which you
learn how to program self-driving cars
and just to motivate what we're trying
to achieve in this class let me show you
some videos so my interest in
self-driving cars started with the DARPA
Grand Challenge in 2004 in which my team
at Stanford developed Stanley a robot
that could drive itself through the
Mojave Desert
the vehicle was based on a Volkswagen
Touareg it was equipped with all kinds
of sensors like GPS and laser and I was
able to make its own decisions without
any human input whatsoever the DARPA
Grand Challenge was a
government-sponsored race that took
place in 2005 here we see our robot
Stanley moving to the desert completely
without a human abort the task was to
drive a desert trail for about 130 miles
and whoever was fastest would win the
race
give it passing a different robot by
Carnegie Mellon University about 110
miles into the race our robot was able
to navigate really steep mountainous
roads unable to avoid collisions with
rocks or falling down a cliff all based
on its ability to use what I'm going to
teach you in this class after almost
seven hours and 131 miles our word
returned all the way to the starting
base as the first robot to ever finish a
dabber grand challenge winning Stanford
University two million bucks and Stanley
a place in the Smithsonian Museum of
American history this work led to the
urban challenge in which we build
another robot called Junior that
eventually took second place the urban
challenge was a follow-up race by DARPA
and which cars were asked to drive in
traffic so whereas the Grand Challenge
was kind of a motionless desert floor
this was a mock urban city weather we
was able to interact with other traffic
and had to follow traffic rules as in
this left turn over here had to be able
to stay on lanes with very high
precision a commented oncoming traffic
and just drive confidently in a
situation that really resembled a small
city this led at Google to a sequence of
experiments known as the Google
self-driving car and I believe these are
the best robotic cars out there today
here we see one of our Priuses on
University Avenue in Palo Alto kind of
undetected driving just like a human
driver but this car is driving by itself
our cars have been able to drive
hundreds of thousands of miles all
across California and some of Nevada in
downtown areas like San Francisco on
busy highways in here in Monterey a
small coastal city in California with
lots and lots of pedestrians and these
are all completely self-driving moments
where the car is able to accommodate
things like deers in the headlight in
the middle of a night or even crooked
Lombard Street in San Francisco as shown
in this video this is what I'm doing
on my day job I really love with my team
building self-driving cars we believe
it's going to be changed the world and
in this class that's what I hope to
enable you to do so let's dive in</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
