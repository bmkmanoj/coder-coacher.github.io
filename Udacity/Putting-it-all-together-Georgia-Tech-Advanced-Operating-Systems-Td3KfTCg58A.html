Andrew file system enables authorized
users who are members of a campus
community to log in remotely from work
station over insecure links and use
private key cryptosystem to validate the
users and allow them to get useful work
done on the workstation they log in
using the username and password they get
back a pair of tokens the secret token
and clear token and this is the first
communication that happens between Venus
and Vice Venus can then establish an RPC
session on behalf of the client by using
the secret token and HKC that's the
second class of communication that
happens between Venus and vice and as a
result of this session establishment
what Venus gets back is a session key
for use in this particular RPC session
subsequently any time the user opens a
file or closes a file or rights to a
file all those file system calls that
requires Venus to communicate with vice
is going to be sent as secure our PC
using the secret token as a client ID
and SK the session key as the private
key for encrypting the message that it
wants to send device and similarly vice
is going to send back responses using
the session key so this is a third class
of client-server interaction that I
mentioned so there are three classes of
client-server interaction the first one
is login second one is RPC session
establishment and the third one is the
actual secure RPC calls that are being
made for manipulating the file system
that resides in the central server so
the upshot of this structure that
@andrew file system provides for the
user community is that the username and
password is exposed only once per login
session so in other words if a student
logs in to a workstation once or twice a
day it's only that many number of times
that the username and passwords are
going to be used on this unsecure
network the handshake key that Venus
gets back as a result of setting up a
login session for a user is used only
for new RPC sessions that's the second
class of communication and the validity
of this handshake e is the duration of
the login session you know that
passwords have a longer validity it as
valid as long as you don't change your
password but the duration of this HKC
that is used for RPC session
establishment that is only for the
duration of the login session once the
user has logged off and left this
workstation a secret token and the clear
token a throwaway by Venus so the
duration of this H cases only for this
login session and a session key is used
for all the RPC calls that Venus is
making on behalf of this client for
manipulating the file system and the
duration of SK is the duration of a
given RPC session for instance within
one login session let's say I have three
different or PC sessions for each of
those distinct RPC sessions I'm going to
get a unique session key and I'm going
to use that session key only for that
particular RPC session once that is done
i cannot reuse that key anymore I'll
have to reestablish a new RPC session
get a new session key and restart the
RPC session so in this lesson module as
a whole first we looked at taxonomy is
proposed by salsa and then we saw how we
can build a practical system
which can be used by a campus community
for securely accessing information in
this case files stored in a central
repository through the Andrew file
system now it is time for a question
that is really asking you to think about
the Andrew file system and its strengths
and weaknesses with respect to providing
security guarantees for the user
community</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
