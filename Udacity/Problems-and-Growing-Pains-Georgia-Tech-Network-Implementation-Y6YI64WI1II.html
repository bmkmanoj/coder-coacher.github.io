considerable problems and growing pains
and it's worth bearing some of these in
mind and thinking about them as many of
them give rise to interesting research
problems to think about as we work
through the material in the course one
of the major problems is that we're
running out of addresses the current
version of the Internet Protocol ipv4
uses 32-bit addresses meaning that the
ipv4 internet only has 2 to the 32 IP
addresses or about 4 billion IP
addresses furthermore these IP addresses
need to be allocated hierarchically and
many portions of the IP address space
are not allocated very efficiently for
example the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology has one 256th of all of the
Internet address space another problem
is congestion control now congestion
controls goal is to match offered load
to available capacity but one of the
problems with today's congestion control
algorithms is that they have
insufficient dynamic range they don't
work very well over slow and flaky
wireless links and they don't work very
well over very high-speed
intercontinental paths now some
solutions exist but change is hard and
all solutions that are deployed must
interact well with one another and
deployment in some sense requires some
amount of consensus a third major
problem is routing routing is the
process by which nodes on the Internet
discover paths to take to reach another
destination
today's inter-domain routing protocol
BGP suffers a number of ills including a
lack of security ease of miss
configuration poor convergence and non
determinism but it sort of works and
it's the most critical piece of the
Internet infrastructure in some sense
because it's the glue that holds all of
the Internet service providers together
another major problem in today's
Internet is security now while we're
reasonably good at encryption and
authentication we are not actually so
good at turning these mechanisms on and
we're pretty bad at key management as
well as deploying secure software and
secure configurations the fifth major
problem
is denial-of-service and the internet
does a very good job of transmitting
packets to a destination even if the
destination doesn't want those packets
this makes it easy for an attacker to
overload servers or network links to
prevent the victim from doing useful
work distributed denial-of-service
attacks are particularly commonplace on
today's internet now the thing that all
of these problems have in common is that
they all require changes to the basic
infrastructure and changing basic
infrastructure is really difficult it's
not even clear what the process is to
achieve consensus on changes so as we
work our way through the course it will
be interesting to see the problems that
we encounter in each of these areas
various solutions that have been
proposed and also to think about ways in
which new protocols and technologies can
be deployed in later parts of the course
we'll learn about a new technology
called Software Defined Networking or
Sdn that makes it easier to solve some
of these problems by rolling out new
software of technologies protocols and
other systems to help manage some of
these issues</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
