variable in it X and the power that X
has taken two is four so that means that
the degree of this term is for this is a
fourth degree turn now this next one is
a little bit tricky 100 is just a
constant term it doesn't have any
variable factors in it or in other words
it has zero variable factors so this
means that it's degree is 0 this is true
of any constant term if we had the
number say 78 here instead or negative
432 or 19.3 any constant term no matter
what its value is has degree 0 so that
means that one half over here which is
also a constant term has a degree of 0
now another way to think of this is that
if we desperately wanted to have a
variable in a constant term we didn't
want to change the value of the term
what power what that variable need to be
taken to so let's say we have one half
here and we want an X in that term in
order to keep this term equal to one
half we need to have x b to the 0 power
since anything any variable any constant
to the 0 power equals 1 that means we
would actually have one half times one
which is just equal to one half but even
if we choose to write the term in this
way with the variable involved the power
of that variable is 0 this is still 0
degree term for this next term why we
need to remember that any variable that
doesn't have an exponent written
explicitly actually has an invisible one
as its power so this term has a degree
of one it's a first degree term and
lastly we have x squared Y squared Z
cubed the degree of this term is just
going to be 2 plus 2 plus 3 which is
equal to 7</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
