classes of graph partitioning methods
are the so called spectral methods that
spectral as in rainbows not ghosts
spectral methods go back to the linear
algebraic view of graphs and they have
what for me is a surprising physics
based interpretation we'll get there but
first let's remind ourselves about the
connection between graph structure and
certain matrices consider an unweighted
directed graph such as this one let's
call this graph G now let's represent it
not by its adjacency matrix but by an
incidence matrix C of G in this form
each row is an edge and each column is a
vertex how do you mark edges let's take
this edge as an example it points from
vertex zero to vertex one let's make it
the first edge in the incidence matrix
and let's mark it using the following
convention we'll put a positive one at
the source vertex and a minus one at the
sink
let me fill in the rest from this
incidence matrix let's construct a new
object called the graph laplacian we'll
define it as the product of C transpose
times C to see what this product is I
want you to compute it algebraically and
then interpret it start by writing C as
a sequence of its M edges here C shown
symbolically as a list of row vectors
where each row vector corresponds to an
edge here's what C transpose times C
would look like let's multiply this out
that is C transpose C is the sum of a
bunch of products each product is an
edge represented as a column vector
multiplied by itself represented as a
row vector to see what this is saying
let's take a closer look at one of these
products each a sub K is some edge let's
call it IJ remember that it's a vector
with a plus 1 in the ice position and a
minus 1 in the J's position so what
about the product this product will be a
matrix and in fact this product will
only have nonzero entries in four places
let's do the diagonals first a diagonal
entry will either be plus one x plus 1
or minus 1 times minus 1 which in either
case is just plus 1 in effect the
diagonals are tallying the number of
incident edges on each vertex that's the
diagonals what about
off diagonals the off diagonals will
always multiply a positive 1 times a
negative 1 in effect the off diagonals
indicate the presence of an edge
however since both J comma I and I comma
J or minus 1 you've effectively lost the
direction information put another way
the graph laplacian is telling you
something about the undirected form of
the original graph in the event that the
original graph was directed now this is
what one of these products tells us but
what about the sum well let's see the
diagonals count the degree of each
vertex let's represent that by a
diagonal matrix D where the diagonal
entries are the degrees of each vertex
let's say they're n vertices and all the
off diagonals mark all the edges that's
basically just the adjacency matrix of
the undirected form of the graph
remember the adjacency matrix would have
a positive 1 anywhere there's an edge
either connecting I J or J I and of
course to get minus ones in the off
diagonal positions we'll subtract the
adjacency matrix
okay so let's construct a graph
laplacian on an example step one is to
throw out the directions then build a
diagonal matrix D that contains the
degrees of each vertex this example
isn't very exciting because every vertex
has degree 3 then build the adjacency
matrix which marks all the edges again
this example isn't very exciting because
it's basically fully connected so there
are ones in all of the off diagonal
entries finally the graph laplacian is
just d minus W in this case that's this
thing take a moment to contemplate the
graph laplacian
once you've done so you can move on to
the more interesting question of how do
I use this doohickey to actually
partition a graph</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
