a technique called dynamic programming
with dynamic programming you can make a
really complicated problem like this one
run much faster by breaking it into
subproblems here the subproblem was
finding the answer for a smaller weight
you begin by solving for something like
a base case a subproblem so small that
the answer is very simple or trivial to
compute we started with one object with
only one thing to consider finding the
maximum possible value for any weight
was simple another common feature of a
dynamic programming solution is a lookup
table that stores solutions to
subproblems we stored the maximum values
for different weight limits in our
lookup table dynamic programming
solutions take advantage of these two
things solving the problem for a trivial
case and storing the solution in a
lookup table by using them to slowly add
complexity to a problem another feature
of a dynamic programming solution is an
equation you said each step as you add
complexity for us the equation looks
something like this the equation often
combines some values previously computed
in the lookup table sometimes with each
other and sometimes with a new value you
introduce like the value of whatever
object you're looking at we used the
values already stored in the table as we
added new objects a technique often
called memoization so we ultimately
didn't need to recompute them every time
this is the hidden power of dynamic
programming you compute and save
solutions to smaller problems then you
don't need to calculate them again for
more complex problems it might seem like
a simple idea but it can have a really
powerful effect on efficiency if it's
done well one of the most useful skills
to have when going into a technical
interview is the ability to spot a
problem that has a dynamic programming
solution it didn't come naturally to me
at first but after practicing by trying
to solve a bunch of dynamic program
problems on my own I started to get the
hang of it one thing you need to look
out for is a complicated problem that
seems to require trying every
combination to find the solution you
need to ask yourself can I break this
problem into subproblems if the answer
is yes then you've got a problem with a
dynamic programming solution</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
