follow we need to be able to create a
cue either from scratch or reuse an
existing one get the main queue and also
add a closure to an existing q grand
central dispatch was not written in
Swift but see unlike Swift c has no
classes or objects so grand central
dispatch is made of functions and types
instead of classes and methods these
functions and types have different
naming conventions than those using
swift but they behave exactly as if they
were swift code first of all we need a
type to represent queues that's dispatch
cutie then we will need a function to
create a cue from scratch dispatch q you
create it takes two parameters and name
and the type of the queue serial or
concurrent to specify serial just pass
dispatch q serial or nil iOS always
gives each app for extra cues on top of
the main one these are called global
cues we access those global cues with a
function dispatch get global q the only
difference between those 4 q's is a
priority or how fast it will get the
attention of the CPU it's a good
practice to avoid creating cues when
you're using an existing one is enough
we will use this patch get global queue
for that we also need a way to obtain
the main queue this is the queue that
runs all your UI we will use the
dispatch get main queue function for
this why we need this might not be
obvious right now but it will be as soon
as we get started with a sample app last
but not least we need a way of adding
closures to the queue that's where
dispatch async comes in this function
takes a cue and a closure it adds
disclosure to the queue and then returns
immediately the code inside the queue
will run sometime in the near future the
exact time will depend on how many
closures already waiting in the queue
and the priority of the queue</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
