path that the light is taking in the
unprimed frame it's moving at this
slight diagonal that means the total d
prime this whole distance up and back
down is two times C T Prime ok so this
side is CT Prime the side is h and this
side while its V times T Prime it's the
speed of the Train V times the time
elapsed that's how far the train has
advanced so actually I have this
wonderful right triangle base hi of h
and hypotenuse of CT Prime I'm going to
do the Pythagorean theorem this squared
plus that squared must equal this
squared and when i do that i get V
squared times T prime squared plus h
squared equals well this side squared
and I'm writing the T Prime's in red
just so we can keep focus on now
actually what I want to do is I want to
solve for T prime so I'm going to move
this term over to this side and what
I've done here is I've factored out the
T prime squared and now i'm going to
divide both sides by this C squared
minus V squared so now I have this my
next step is a bit of a trick so what
I'm going to do is I'm going to divide
both the numerator and the denominator
on the left hand side by C squared and
since I'm doing it to both the numerator
denominator that's totally fine and what
i get when i do that is this and now
maybe you can start to see why i decided
to divide by c squared i did that
because when we look at these two
equations these are both d so i can set
them equal to each other to h equals to
CT the twos cancel and t is equal to h /
see remember this is the unprimed t so
what i can do is replace this age / c
with t now what I have is a relationship
between the time measured on well
unfortunately i erased read but measured
on reds clock and the time T measured on
greens clock let's just take the square
root of both sides and I find that the
time measured on T Prime the red clock
sequel to the time measured on this
guy's clock with this mathematical
expression modifying it I would have no
reason to believe that two identical
clocks should ever run at different
rates but what I found here is that it's
not only that the clocks are running at
different rates that time itself
can't be universally specified my time
is not the same as your time if we're
moving relative to each other this is
amazing let's look at this equation in a
little more detail</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
