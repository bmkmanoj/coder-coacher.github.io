remember we just talked about getting
customers let's talk about keeping
customers this is what I call the you
should be so lucky to have this problem
part of the funnel and that's how you
grow the customers you have you're
thinking about growing customers nothing
magic you've now sold these customers
way back here under purchase and you've
kept them around with loyalty programs
and product updates but really what
you'd like to do understanding now that
it's a lot cheaper to sell existing
customers more stuff than it is to get
new customers is let's go try to sell
them some stuff and how can we do that
well the first thing you might want to
think about is can i unbundle some of
the stuff in my startup that i try to
package all at once one of the mistakes
that early-stage ventures make that is
new companies is thinking that you have
to stick every possible feature in the
product and sell it for the one price it
might be possible once you understand
more and more about your customers to
know that you know what most people just
kind of want the base product or you
might have a freemium strategy which
just says I'll give them the base
product for free but really
understanding that what they're gonna
want some percentage just these other
things unbundling it's just a fancy word
for saying can I somehow decompose the
product into separate pieces giving some
for free or if you're lucky charging for
every one of them I used to do this all
the time to actually increase the
average selling price by unbundling the
problem the next thing to think about is
can I upsell the private a retailer in
the United States called Sears had a
line of tools that they sold the people
who made things and their product line
always had three types of products good
better and best and what they would try
to get you to do is get you into the
store looking at the price of the good
product but then when you got there you
said well I deserve better and then
someday I could aspire to the best and
so that was kind of upselling in the
same product line and in fact in the
United States from the 1920s to the
1960s the master of upselling was
General Motors when they had separate
brands each had a fixed price point you
started buying a car with a Chevrolet
then you moved up to a Buick then a
Pontiac then an Oldsmobile then
eventually you could aspire to a cat
and these were all kind of upselling
based on aspirations and the quality and
features of the products increased as
well you might want to think about
creating an upsell strategy cross-sell
well that's also kind of simple gee if
you're buying one product
are there any accessories or companion
products then you ought to just figure
out to make sure that your customers are
aware of or on the pricing page or on a
price list say gee when you buy this
product will give you a 20% discount off
of this other one which most consumers
would realize oh I'd like to have that
too and so thinking about what adjacent
products what products next to the one
you're already selling customers can buy
is a cross selling strategy finally the
last piece is referrals and that's
another growth strategy and referrals
basically generates this outer viral
loop remember what we were trying to do
in the initial purchase or get your new
customers to start telling their friends
about your products you want to do the
same thing after you've had those
customers for a while
maybe now you want to give them
discounts on future purchases you want
to say thank you for doing this by the
way
$100 off or $5 off of the next purchase
when you bring in the next new customers
banks now think that's a popular
strategy and this referral program just
helps your customers hopefully who are
satisfied sell more of your product for
you and so that's get keep and now grow
customers by the way this grow funnel
just like in get customers there's
nothing magic about cross sell upsell
and unbundling there might be other
strategies that your company and your
startup might want to stick into this
funnel as well we put this up as kind of
a canonical model because most companies
tend to use these types of techniques
but it really depends on what your
industry and product line is</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
