what's the answer so I was thinking
about a before you threw in the B so let
me let me not think about B yet I'll
just think about a so you had said in
state one it can go either left or right
and in state four it can go either left
or right so boy that sounds a lot like
two times two equals four yes that's
exactly right generally speaking so
actually walk me through that again
Michael how did you get two times two so
well I had a little choice about how to
think about it one is that in some sense
if you go right from one then you don't
really have to make another choice right
but if you go left then you have this
other choice to make of either going
left or right so it's manure iting it
down as a mapping from state to action
you've got two choices at state one and
two choices it's date four and so that
is two times two right you can make
independently choose each of those right
that's exactly right
so in fact it's important there that
even though if I had gone right on one I
would never have to make another choice
because I can't reach state four in
order to be a strategy you have to
basically say what you would do in all
states where you might end up okay
that's fair okay all right so what about
be using that incredible reasoning so
yeah so be it seems a little trickier
because here it can only ever matter
whether you're in like if player a sends
us down to the left then we have a
choice of three if player one sends us
down the right we have a choice of one
which is really no choice at all mm-hmm
you can have any color car you want as
long as it's black yeah play my Tesla I
was thinking the Model T but maybe T
stands for Tesla he does stand for Tesla
so by the definition of how many
different you know sort of reachable
strategies it would be one answer but if
you're defining it the way you're
defining it it's going to be three times
one or three yeah and that's exactly
right good Michael
so let's actually write down what those
strategies are</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
