much fun they're like logic puzzles you
have to work through even if you don't
get it right the first try it's really
fun to keep going and trying to gather
as much information as you can to make
the best possible guess in this case the
answer I was looking for is one-sixth or
one out of six you might have also had
point 16 repeating or something around
sixteen point six percent repeating
something like that fractions are easier
to deal with here so let's try to work
with that well let's think about this
for a second we know it's an autosomal
recessive pedigree so if that's true it
means males and females are affected
equally because this is on an auto some
somewhere this affected male here this
must mean that he is homozygous
recessive these homozygous recessive we
know that his parents had at least one
recessive copy apiece because he would
have had to have gotten both of his
copies from his parents well they must
have a recessive copy but they're not
affected this means they must have a
dominant normal copy here so his parents
must be heterozygous we figured all that
out already so now let's look at his
siblings we know they're not affected so
they're not minus minus but they could
be either plus plus or plus minus right
so there are two options here let's
focus on this female because this female
is involved in the reproductive event
here so to figure out what the
probability is that this individual is
heterozygous because that's the only way
that they could pass this allele on and
have an infected chatters we got to
figure out the probability of this
individual being heterozygous we're
going to do the punnett squares of the
parents all right if the mom and dad
here are both heads then we could either
have a plus plus a plus minus a plus
minus or minus minus now we know already
it can't be mine is minus so let's get
rid of that option right there that
gives us three options left two out of
three of those are the head so we're
going to say she's a two-thirds
probability of being heterozygous now
let's do the same thing over here we
know that the mother is affected which
means that she's homozygous recessive in
the same way that we figured that out
over here
her son is unaffected so that means he
must have at least one normal dominant
copy but he must also have one recessive
copy because the mother only had a
recessive copy to give so he must be
heterozygous that's a probability of one
that he's heterozygous now if he's had a
rose I guess and the person he's meeting
with is also heterozygous set up their
punnett squares they could have a plus
plus a plus minus a plus minus or minus
minus only one of these cases is an
affected individual the homozygous
recessive so that's one in four so now
what we have to do is multiply all our
probabilities together we don't add them
we multiply them so the probability that
this guy is heterozygous is one so we do
one the probability that the mother is
heterozygous is two-thirds and the
probability that they'll actually have
an offspring that's affected is
one-fourth so this would be to over 12
which is equal to 1 over 6 now that's a
simple one imagine if I gave you a hard
one hopefully you'll have a little more
respect for those genetic counselors</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
