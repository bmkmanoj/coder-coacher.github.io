that is given an address how do I find
out whether the data is in the cache and
how do I retrieve it we'll start with
the direct mapped cache and the little
notation let's suppose that we have to
the MN dresses that our cache block or
cache line is two to the n bytes and
that our cache has space for two to the
K entries all these are always a power
of two with these definition we'll call
the lowest n bits the offset they tell
us we're within a given cache block the
memory we want is and the rest of the
bits tell us the block number but how do
we know where to look for this block in
the cache we need some kind of hashing
function well the easiest hashing
function just looks at the lower order
bits and that is exactly what a direct
mapping does the next K bits of the
address tell us the right index to look
for our data in in the cache of course
this means that multiple addresses will
get hash to the same location within the
cache given that our cache had to be
small this was inevitable but we need a
way to distinguish them the solution is
to use the tag or the higher order bits
of the address as a kind of confirmation
let's do a quick example suppose that we
have an N bit address space that our
cache block is 2 bytes long so we just
have 1 bit for the offset and that there
are 4 entries in our cache so we want
two bits for our index then a direct
mapping will look something like this
or all the blue addresses would get
mapped to the blue block of the cache
the green addresses would get mapped to
the green and so forth we can tell which
the colored blocks is actually in the
cache by consulting the tag associated
with the data in the cache in this
example the tag for the blue is 0
because it's the 0th blue block that's
in the cache similarly the tag for the
green block is 1 because it's the one
green block that's in a cache and the
same principle holds for all the other
colors as well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
