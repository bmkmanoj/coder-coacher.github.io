complexity classes so we have already
drawn this picture here the hierarchy of
P versus NP where this X time was this
next time and of course there are other
complexity classes that we have gotten
to know in this course so there's the
class of fixed parameter tractable
problems then we looked at problems for
which there are or are not approximation
algorithms so we had problems for which
there was a PTAs we had some problems
for which there was a constant factor
approximation and we also mentioned that
there are problems such as clique and
independent set for which there is no
constant factor approximation unless P
equals NP and then finally we looked at
randomized algorithms where we said
there were multicolored algorithms those
were the problems that were guaranteed
to run polynomial time but only with a
certain probability give us a correct
solution and then we also mentioned Las
Vegas algorithms which are algorithms
that guarantee as a correct solution but
the running time is only polynomial with
a certain given probability of course we
can also start building hierarchies here
so we can do a hierarchy for
approximation and we can do a hierarchy
for randomized algorithms and guess what
this is going to be our next quiz so as
in the quiz before when we talked about
pnp x time and next time I'm again
giving numbers to these complexity
classes here and again I would like you
to enter the numbers here so that we
form a nice hierarchy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
