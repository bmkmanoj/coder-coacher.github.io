electricity so let's say that Benjamin
Franklin is standing in a room holding
an object and this room actually has a
horizontal electric field and that
electric field is equal to 100 Newton's
per Coulomb well obviously Ben Franklin
is very excited because he gets do an
experiment with electricity furthermore
let's say this ball has both a mess
eight kilograms and it's actually
charged as well its charge is 0.1
coulombs and that's a positive charge
now what's going to happen when he
releases this ball is it won't feel two
forces it will of course feel forced
from gravity downwards but it's also
going to feel an electric force and so
it's going to undergo two-dimensional
motion this will be much different than
the two-dimensional motion of a ball
being thrown in the air on your normal
circumstances because now there's going
to be a horizontal component of
acceleration I want you to tell me if
this height is equal to 1.2 meters and
we know that the ball will feel force
over here so it'll probably land
somewhere I don't know here here or here
I want you to tell me d the distance
away from Ben Franklin where the ball
strikes the ground and you can enter
your answer here in meters I'm warning
you this is a quite tricky question but
using what you know about f equals ma
and motion and electricity you can tie
it all together and I believe you can
get this answer give it a shot</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
