what let's just go through these the
ones that don't have names yet and give
them names you know kind of think
through what it is that they are like
and label them okay sure we can do that
all right so if the first one is regular
in DP and what makes it a regular MDP is
that you're doing an expectation over
the next next best action that will be
taken right right the best next action I
would say right right that's right
that's the right way right way of saying
so here the only difference between the
second one of the first one is that
instead of doing an expectation you're
going to only pay attention to the worst
possible state you could get into mmm
okay and so so we're taking out the
actual stochastic dynamics of the MDP
and replacing it with something that is
that is minimizing right and so that
means if we were thinking about the the
function of the very top the Q star is
not you know kind of the value of taking
an action in a particular state given
that you're then going to do the best
thing from that point on but it's sort
of the value you would get if you sort
of always assume the worst thing could
happen and if that were true everywhere
then you would be valuing things by the
worst possible outcome and so that would
be a kind of oh I don't know what the
right word is maybe something like a
pessimistic mdp or a risk-averse MVP
something like that oh good worst-case
MVP maybe mm-hmm no it's also related to
in control theory the notion of h
infinity control the h infinity control
basically says you know i don't know
what's going to happen so let me assume
that the worst thing is going to happen
okay so so pessimistic sort of describes
the outlook on the world of this
equation but as risk averse the right
thing this suggests that i will end up
trying to choose asked actions that put
me places where the least bad thing
could happen
well I mean I wouldn't quite think of it
that way so it's almost as if the
environment is out to get you right so
instead of just randomly transitioning
you to some state it's always putting
you in a state that makes you the least
happy of all the states that you could
go to also grad school well it depends
where you go to grad school like Rhode
Island is a pretty good state all right
so we're going to be placed in the state
that is worse for us and once we get
there then we get to choose an action we
get to choose the action that's best for
us so it's almost also a kind of game
right where we get to make a move and
then the environment makes a move and
then we make a move in then the
environment makes a move okay I like
that I like that but that means you
would want to choose the action that
would get you to the place where kind of
the worst the least worst thing can
happen yeah that's right right so the so
the meet us the agent the ones who's
doing the deciding is trying to be
risk-averse relative to what the
environment might do to it right sure
that makes perfect sense okay so
risk-averse is not a bad description
good so so other answers that I would
except for here include things like
adversarial dynamics or two player game
things like that I guess you could also
notice the way this is written here this
is the min overall next States so this
is really going to always transition us
to the worst state not the worst state
that makes any sense because we didn't
do something like you know for all
states in the set of states that are
reachable with probability greater than
zero right that's a little bit more
constrained we didn't constrain it so
really could just be an MVP that makes
you sit in the in the worst possible
place and just pummels you over and over
again but I don't think there's a
there's a nice distinct name for that I
thought thats pretty succinct what you
said all right good</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
