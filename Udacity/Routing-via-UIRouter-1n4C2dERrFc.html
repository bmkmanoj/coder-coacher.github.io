but we finally made it to the last one
we'll be looking at routing up until
this point we've worked with apps that
have just one view and that's fine but
it's not very functional or interactive
single page applications typically have
many different views or screens that you
can interact with a router handles
loading these views based on the URL
when we generate an angular app with yo
angular it asks us if we want to include
a number of modules one of the options
is angular route this routing module
works well but it's kind of limited
since it doesn't allow for nested views
we want to have specific sections of the
page update and change while the rest
stays the same so instead of using this
angular route module will use the
community built routing module called UI
router the documentation for the UI
router module is incredibly detailed
make sure to also check out the website
in the sample app to see all of the
functionality UI router offers since UI
router doesn't come as part of the
default installation we need to add it
to our project the angular generator
uses bower to install angular so let's
use Bower to install UI router don't
forget to add the dash S to save UI
router to the bower config file one of
the files that's created when we
generate an app with the yo angular
command is a grunt file this file
manages a lot of the development process
from watching files for changes to
reloading the browser one of the cool
things is that it can pair with other
commands like the bower command we just
used when we installed UI router with
Bauer grunts saw that and included it in
our index file everything that we've
been building up to this point has all
been inside our you decimals module we
created the module and then attached
controllers and services to it UI router
is a module itself and contains its own
inner components back when we created
our module we passed an empty array of
dependencies now we have to add UI
router to that list so we can use it
just like injecting a service into a
controller to inject one module into
another we just add the name as a string
so this is injecting the UI router
module into our you decimals app module
a word of caution though all over the
docs it's you I dash router but when you
include it its UI router this little
guys tripped me up several times so
watch out that he doesn't get you too
we've looked at Yui router is better
than the default router module we've
added UI router to our project and we've
injected
to the you decimals module let's take a
look at how to set up ui-router to
manage the state of our app</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
