how to program was casting and that was
something that I feel like I learned
casting a little bit later than everyone
else because it's just it was very
foreign to me to really understand like
how everything was set up initially and
so when I learned about like you know oh
I have variables like I got that ok so
there's variables but then you know
you've got in so you've got doubles and
that was one of those things that I
didn't understand the importance of it
and for a while I kind of dismissed it
it's like I don't want to ask for help
like it's ok like I'm just gonna just
gonna go right through this and then I
would have problems or I'd be running my
code and then like you know it all of
sudden like I get a crazy long number
back I'm looking like what did I do
wrong like the person next we just got
six how did I want I'd mess up here
anything that was one of the things that
like I think my pride a little bit got
in the way that I probably should have
just like you know in like hey why is it
my number working by the time I
understood like the difference is like a
whole number versus like you know number
the test more like then I was like oh I
get it like now it's just like
instinctive like whenever I'm you know
writing something like I know which a
number like what kind of cast I'm gonna
have with it and it's those little
things that like the kind of stand in
the way at first words it's silly
looking back but I mean once you get the
like major concepts out and it's like
you wouldn't even think twice about its
like I've got a hand and well I've got
an intent</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
