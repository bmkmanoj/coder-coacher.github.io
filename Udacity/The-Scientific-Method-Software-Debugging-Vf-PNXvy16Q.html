initial observation from this initial
observation you derive a hypothesis a
possible explanation for what you just
observed if the hypothesis explains your
observation the hypothesis must be
useful to make a prediction in our
example the initial observation was the
Apple falling the hypothesis would be
well every solid object falls down and
then a prediction would be if I take
this plate and let it fall it's going to
go straight down towards the floor
it may also break along the way this is
what three-years-old do the experiment
means to actually verify the prediction
so you take the plate and let it fall
from the experiment comes the
observations what do you see
well the plate actually was attracted
towards the ground and so you can now go
and check whether what you just observed
in your experiment is as predicted and
therefore satisfies the hypothesis then
we say it supports the hypothesis and we
can refine the hypothesis our case for
instance we can generalize it towards
other objects and to come up with a more
general hypothesis if the observation
however is not in line with your
prediction then the hypothesis is
rejected and if the hypothesis is
rejected you need to come up with a new
hypothesis and this cycle going along
from hypothesis through prediction
through experiment through observation
and gradually refining the hypothesis or
coming up with alternatives this is
something you repeat again and again
until your hypothesis becomes consistent
with all observations and has so much
predictive power that it becomes what
one calls a theory and a theory you
repeat the process of refining the
hypothesis through a prediction
experiment observation or creating new
hypotheses again going through this
circle again and again and again until
your hypothesis becomes a theory that is
a predictive and comprehensive
description of some aspect of reality</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
