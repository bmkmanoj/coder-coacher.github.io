I want to highlight a few new words that
we've used in the code thus far we've
identified turtle as a class and Brad
and Angie as instances of that class now
I want to take a moment and talk about
these new words you can think of a class
as a blueprint of a building now a
blueprint as we know contains certain
pieces of information about the building
for instance the height of the building
the number of rooms in the building we
also know that the same blueprint can be
used to build multiple different
buildings for instance an office with
yellow walls and a residential complex
with blue walls a class is like a
blueprint so let's take the example of
class turtle that we've used thus far a
class turtle much like a blueprint
contains certain pieces of information
about the turtle the turtle size its
color the fact that the turtle can move
forward and turn right and from this
class or blueprint we can create
multiple different instances of that
class for example Brad is an instance of
class turtle that draws a yellow square
and Angie is also an instance of class
turtle that draws a blue circle so in
summation you can think of a class as a
blueprint and you can think of its
objects as examples or instances of that
blueprint</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
