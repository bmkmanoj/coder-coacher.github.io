lateral geniculate is actually part of
the thalamus if you were to take that
thalamus and take a slice of it which is
what they're showing here and then you
stained four cell bodies and and the
neuroanatomists they really have all
sorts of clever ways of applying
different kinds of chemicals that light
up in different colors or intensities
the different types of cellular
structures that are there so you can
actually see what's going on if you took
this slice you would see that the
lateral geniculate has got these layers
right you can see this layer one right
here right layer two and it's really
remarkable that they have these fixed
layers alright remember these things
just grow it's not like somebody got
there and with a soldering iron and
built them these things grow to have
these computational structures right so
if you take you know the double es or
computer scientists among you you're
used to seeing schematic charts of
high-end chips that have all these
layered structures in them you know
you've got your trend or your transistor
arrays here and different memory things
there these things just grow like this
pretty cool and the layers are different
in fact you can actually tell a little
bit that layers one and two seem to be a
little bit different than layers three
four five and six and in fact they are
layers one or two or it called the
magnocellular layers and these are
referred to as the parvocellular layers
and the most important difference for
you is that one and two tend to be the
where cells and these are referred to as
the what cells and that has to do with
where they project going forward we'll
talk about that in a minute
the other thing to know is that both
eyes project to the left side for
whatever's looking at the right half
side of the visual field and both eyes
project to the right side from what's
looking at the left-hand side of the
visual field well you can see that
explicitly in the lateral geniculate
layers one four and six come from the
same side eye and layers two three and
five make it that right yep come from
the other side of the eye so we haven't
combined the two eyes yet right we still
have two separate channels why do we
have to combine the two eyes well how
about things like stereo well that's
gonna go on up in the cortex right you
have to
get both of the images together but at
the LGN level lateral geniculate they
are still separate the what goes the
where was up the superior cause which
you can see on this kind of creepy
picture here so here it is kind of
creepy right you got your eyeball anyway
what you're seeing here is this the
coming in optic chiasm through the
lateral geniculate and then projecting
up to the superior colliculus and the
thing that matters as I said I think
earlier the superior colliculus is
involved in eye movements so one of the
things that has to happen very quickly
is if something moves over here I have
to get my eyes over there very very fast
alright so you have very good
sensitivity to motion in your retina in
the periphery and then you've got a
circuitry that's involved in rapidly
going you know it doesn't go over it
doesn't make many neural stops along the
way right we go from your retina which
is doing some chemical stuff for right
away one electrical stop into the
lateral geniculate and directly to the
superior colliculus now as I said
earlier this is an overly simplified
story I encourage you to take a course
on sensation perception and neuroanatomy
if you're interested in this but if the
story is pretty close so anyway so those
layers one and two go directly to the
superior colliculus but where's the
really cool stuff happening well the
really cool stuff happening is when you
leave the lateral geniculate and you get
up to the cortex so here is a another
picture of your brain just to remind you
of where pieces are again your nose is
over here
here's your cerebellum back here
involved in like balance and motor
controls and here are a bunch of the
different quarter cortex cortical
regions alright there's this sulcus
which is this sort of gap here right
behind it this is somatosensory this is
where you feel your touch senses are
right in front of it by the way not
drawn in here is a bunch of stuff having
to do with motor control controlling
your muscles auditory cortex in here and
then this massive piece of stuff and
then it doesn't look quite so massive
here but it actually folds inside your
brain we're gonna have to unfold your
brain in a minute that's all a visual
cortex and that's all the processing of
visual information</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
