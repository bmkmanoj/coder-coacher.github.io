create new notes by tapping a button
will you have to add a new cell for the
table notify the table so it reloads the
beauty of core data is that it takes
care of all of that so let's create the
new method try it out and see what's
actually happening first let's add an
Add button and link it to an ID action
now we get to implement this action and
you might want to think a little bit
about what should go in here creating a
new note seems like the obvious thing so
let's start there okay so we have our
new note but now do we have to do
anything else should we update the table
view well you think about it I'll go
ahead and run the app so we have a
storyboard which is updated with an app
button which is linked to an IV action
now we get to implement this action and
you might want to think a little bit
about what should go in here creating a
new note seems like the obvious thing so
let's start there now do we have to do
anything else should we update the table
view while you think about it I'll go
ahead and run the app tada magic well I
don't know about you but I usually want
to see how a magic trick actually works
so who's actually getting the job done
here it's the MVC the notifications and
the delegate at work</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
