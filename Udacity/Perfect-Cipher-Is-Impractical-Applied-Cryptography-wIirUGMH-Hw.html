that if a cipher is perfect it must have
this property
it must be impractical in the sense that
the number of possible keys must be at
least as big as the number of possible
messages we saw for the one-time pad
that they were equal we can always
remove possible messages from the
message set so there's no problem with
adding more keys the problem is we need
to have at least as many keys as
messages so let's prove this property
and we're going to prove it by
contradiction so we're going to start by
assuming that we do have a perfect
cipher that does not satisfy this
property so suppose we do have some
perfect cipher we'll call it E where the
number of possible messages is greater
than the number of possible keys there's
some cipher text i'll call it c0 element
of the set of possible ciphertext and
let's assume that that ciphertext is
possible we know that there must be such
a ciphertext that there's some key that
encrypts some message to c0 so the
probability that a message in key get
encrypted to this ciphertext is greater
than zero so we know that such a
ciphertext must exist now we have our
ciphertext C zero let's try decrypting
that so we'll decrypt it with all keys
in the key space so we haven't mentioned
what the decryption function is for the
one-time pad it's exactly the same as
the encryption function for this we
don't want to assume this it could be
any function so we'll assume there's
some function D that's our encryption
function now since our cipher is correct
right in order to be perfect it has to
both be correct and perfectly secure
that means the decryption function must
have the property that if we decrypt a
message encrypted with the same key we
always get the same message out so we
don't need to know anything else about
the decryption function than that and we
shouldn't assume anything because all
we're trying to do is show that there is
no possible choice for e that is both a
correct encryption function and a
perfect cipher so now what happens when
we decrypt c0 with all possible keys
well we're going to look at the set of
messages that we can produce so we'll
call m0 the set of messages that we get
by unioning over all possible keys the
result of
decrypting this ciphertext C 0 so this
models what an attacker would do they've
intercepted some ciphertext they're
trying all possible keys this is what a
brute-force attacker would do and
looking at all the possible messages
that can be produced so now I want you
to think about which of these statements
are true check all the statements that
must be true</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
