degree program we had you do an exercise
to see how just broadly used machine
learning can be we had to look up a
topic that you're interested in a lot of
machine learning to see if they'd been
applied there yet for me I used
basketball astronomy and cooking and
found the machine learning had already
been applied to all three of those
domains for the final project in the
standard degree program you're going to
revisit that idea you're going to take
on a project that's completely your own
you're going to choose your own data set
your own area your own domain and see
what you can find through machine
learning you're going to see what
techniques you should apply to that data
set you're going to see what models you
can build for the data available in that
area now we've collected some data sets
for you that you can use and you might
be interested in some of the ones that
we've gathered but there's plenty
available online as well and we've
actually provided some links for you to
go look up some of your own data sets
the idea of this class project is that
machine learning is much more than being
able to use the techniques that you've
learned it's also knowing when to use
them and how to evaluate the results
that come out of them so for this final
project that's exactly what you're going
to do you're going to take on your own
data set your own question generate your
own models generate your own conclusions
and report them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
