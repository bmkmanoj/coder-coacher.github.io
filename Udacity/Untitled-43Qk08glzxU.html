checking if the air coming back is nil
but we can actually do more informative
robust checks to handle errors we may
not have considered and to give
ourselves better debug info let's start
by looking at this function here at the
top this function display error we've
created to print out the errors that we
find and to re-enable the UI so this
looks like something we can use in all
of our other error checks awesome now
let's go back to the first error we
check it's this the error value that
gets returned from our network request
previously we were checking if this
value equals nil by using an if
statement we're now going to use a guard
statement to make this check and we'll
do this as well with the other checks
we're making in addition to some new
errors we're checking for will explain
guard statements a little bit but if
you're completely unfamiliar with them
you should definitely check out the
guard statements Swift syntax lesson to
explain guard statements let's look at
what we're doing with this data that
gets returned if you recall from before
we were using optional binding that's
the if let syntax to get our data out of
optional form and make sure it exists
we're actually still checking that but
in a slightly different way by using the
guard statement we're actually now only
checking if the data doesn't exist and
using our display error function to
display an error if that's the case if
the data does exist we get to move on
and data is no longer an optional form
this is nice because it's quick and it
allows us to avoid those large nested if
statements you can see that down here
we've made the same small adjustment for
photos dictionary and image URL string
it's a neat effective alternative to the
if statements we had there previously
now back up here let's put back in the
check to see if error equals nil
this time using a guard statement now
you'll notice with all of these the
guard steamin keeps the conditions and
associated errors to display in one
place which ends up making our code a
lot cleaner lastly let's just add in a
few more error checks did we get a
successful HTTP response this statement
checks to make sure our status code is
in the 200s range or the success range
now let's check down here after we've
used NS jason serialization to see what
we're saving and parse result is
actually okay and usable great we're
responsibly checking for errors note
that we can actually combine many of
these guard statements together but
we've separated each into its own
statement to make it more clear what
their purposes are if you feel
comfortable with what each of these
statements does you can feel free to
combine them yourself</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
