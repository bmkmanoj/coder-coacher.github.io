of our data in a relational database
your next question is probably how do we
get it out and what can we do with it
well let's try to learn about this using
our odd hard data now data is usually
retrieved from a relational database
using one of a family of languages that
I'll call sequel like languages while
there are some small variations between
the languages they have the same general
concepts and syntax now how could we
query the Aadhaar enrollment data set
with sequel like syntax if our data was
in a database stored in a table called
odd hard data well the most simple thing
that we might want to do is simply to
select all of the data that is all rows
and columns if we wanted to do that we
could type something like select star
from odd hard data
note that the sequel syntax is pretty
human readable we're just saying we want
the Select star or everything from the
odd hard data table if we were to run
this command as is we would produce tens
of thousands of rows which is probably
not super constructive right now so what
we can do is limit the number of rows by
just saying limit 20 at the end of our
sequel command if we ran this query
let's see what we get back oh great
the first 20 rows of the data these are
rows describing enrollments for the
Registrar Allahabad Bank with various
enrolment agencies districts age genders
etc now say we only wanted some of these
columns say district and subdistrict we
could just ask for those specific
columns instead of star for example we
might write select district sub district
from odd hard data limit 20</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
