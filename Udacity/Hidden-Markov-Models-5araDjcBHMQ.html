model for what we're going to do is
what's referred to as a hidden Markov
model so here's the basic idea
suppose you actually can't observe the
state okay
so there's some state doing its thing
but you can't observe it but what you
can observe our refer to as observables
or the evidence so let's suppose for the
same weather example okay let's suppose
the things that we can observe are
essentially what women of the day happen
to be wearing or carrying so maybe I see
this very chic bathing suit on a person
or I see it just a nice coat that could
be worn when anytime that it was sunny
or an umbrella so these are the evidence
of what the state is so before I can go
further I have to tell you one more
thing about our Markovian system and
that's what's referred to as the
emission probabilities emission if you
think of it as symbols being spit out
and the emission probabilities are
written like this B sub J of K and what
that means is the probability that
you'll see symbol K that you'll see a
bathing-suit given that at some time
you're in some particular state okay so
what's the probability you'll see a
bathing-suit given that it's sunny
what's probably you'd see a bathing-suit
given that it's snowy all right those
are called the emission probabilities
and what that means our entire system
when it's running looks like this in
this new system where we can't observe
the states we don't ask questions about
the likelihood of having seen a
particular sequence of states because we
can't see the states instead we're going
to ask about the likelihood or the
probability of seeing a particular
sequence of observations so that's shown
here so you could say given this
sequence of observation coat coat bra
umbrella bathing suit Braille umbrella
what's the probability of that series of
that sequence of observations well we
could evaluate that if you give us
everything right so here I've just
written it out as P of oh is this all
the sequence of all the observations and
I know the way to compute that and we'll
get more the details later is I
say well if you told me the sequence of
states then I could tell you the
probability of given observation and if
I multiply that by the probability of
that sequence I could get the whole
thing so one simple example is well one
possible sequence of states just one is
that it's all son right and that can be
determined from the yellow stuff here
all right right so it's a probability
that I start with son 0.7 right there
and then I follow that with a whole
bunch of son point eight point great all
east all sunny days so this is the
probability of all sunny days and this
would be the probability of seeing this
sequence if every day was sunny right so
the coat is a point three probability
there's four umbrellas and there's only
a 10% chance of seeing an umbrella when
it's sunny notice by the way I wrote
point one to the four here the order
doesn't matter right because I'm
assuming that if you tell me the state
that I can tell you the probability of
being of having an umbrella it doesn't
matter what the day before or the day
after was you tell me that it's that
it's raining I can tell you the
probability that they're carrying an
umbrella but this was only for one
particular sequence of all Sun you have
to worry about all possible sequences of
weather over those seven days to talk
about the probability of getting this
one series so to make that a little
clearer and easier let's just do the
math</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
