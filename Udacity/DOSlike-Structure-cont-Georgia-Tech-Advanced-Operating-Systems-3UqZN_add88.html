difference from the monolithic structure
that I showed you earlier is that the
red line separating the application from
the operating system is now replaced by
a dotted line what that means the main
difference is there is no hard
separation between the address space of
the application and the address space of
the operating system the good news is an
application can access all the operating
system services very quickly as they
would any procedures that they may
execute within their own application
with the same speed at memory speeds an
application can make calls into the
operating system and get system services
that's the good news but the bad news is
that there is no protection of the
operating system from an errant
application so the integrity of the
operating system can be compromised by a
runaway application either maliciously
or unintentionally corrupting the data
structures that are in the operating
system now you may wonder why Doss chose
this particular structure well at least
in the early days of PC it was thought
that a personal computer as the name
suggests is a platform for a single user
and more importantly the vision was
there will be exactly one app that is
running at a time not even multitasking
so performance and simplicity was the
key and protection was not the primary
concern in the Dalek structure and that
you can get good performance comes from
the very simple observation that there
is no hard separation between the
application of the operating system the
operating system is not living in its
own address space the application and
the operating system are in the same
address space and therefore making a
system call by an application is going
to happen as quickly as the application
would call a procedure which the
application developer wrote in
for herself</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
