terminal you can't just click around and
explore venues like you can with a
graphical program this doesn't mean that
you need to remember every command and
every option though looking things up is
a regular part of the terminal users
workflow in fact as normal to forget the
details of commands you don't use
frequently Cal say is an example of a
program with a bunch of options by
default Cal State LA so cal but you can
customize it to for example by using the
dash EE argument we can replace its eyes
with carrots we can also draw a penguin
instead of a cow so how do we keep up
with all these options fortunately all
common shell programs come with a manual
and there's a command that makes it easy
to read them man manually trees are
called man pages and this is Cal says
man page man pages follow a common
format the first section includes the
commands name and a brief description of
the command the next section is the
synopsis the synopsis explains how to
use the commands flags and arguments
options surrounded by square brackets
are optional in this case all of calcite
options are optional some options
require additional information for
example if you use the dash V flag you
also need to supply a nice string the
description describes all the options in
detail man pages vary in how they
present this information some man pages
alphabetize your option while Cal stays
man page is a bit less organized you can
use the arrow keys to scroll up and down
the man page the later sessions of the
man page include more detailed
information about the command man pages
are typically arranged so that the most
important details are near the top when
you're done referencing the manual you
can press Q to exit</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
