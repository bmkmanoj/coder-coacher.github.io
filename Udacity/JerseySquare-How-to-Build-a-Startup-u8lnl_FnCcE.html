death let me use the example that we use
throughout the lectures and this is just
a team that actually did this in five
days not three weeks there was a team at
Columbia University called Jersey Square
and they were a rental service for
professional sports jerseys and in five
days they did a hundred and sixty-nine
interviews and had 190 people show up at
their website and they actually sold two
of their products
five days from our idea into a business
so on day one these were their initial
hypotheses coming into the class they
thought that their customer segments was
going to be professional sports game
attendees that is they were beginning
with a series of hypotheses about their
customer archetype and they thought
their value proposition was going to
provide a cheaper way to
officially-licensed sports jerseys to a
game eliminate the risk of owning a
player whose Jersey is traded and to
provide alternatives to purchasing
counterfeit jerseys and their sales
channel was gonna be websites or stadium
shops or ticket websites or direct mail
and how they were gonna create demand
was through search ads social media
stadium promotions and their revenue
stream is going to be through annual
subscription model so when we took a
look at this day one canvassed the
teaching team you know first said we
don't even believe that there's a market
here what's the total available market
them you know is this like a hobby or a
business and how do you know and did you
do any real customer discovery and our
skepticism
really in fact infuriated these guys who
they thought there were domain experts
because they were wearing a lot of
jerseys and teaching team this is your
job
you want to irritate them into action we
did this on purpose not by accident we
wanted these people to come back on the
first day with enormous proof that this
was even worth spending their time and
they did it they went out to Yankee
Stadium in New York and found the most
people in the densest area they could
who actually were potential customers
and they spoke to 60 some-odd customers
just to prove to us what idiots the
teaching team was by design
they didn't understand that that was
part of our game is to get them to raise
theirs and when they came back again
they showed
Hey look you know there might be a real
business here and it's even bigger than
we thought because it includes females
and so one of the things we pointed out
to them is it looked like they had most
multiple customer segments and this just
is a teaching team tactic but when you
have multiple customer segments you have
to have multiple value props and you
probably have multiple revenue models if
not multiple other things just for
logistics just for you to be able to
teach we beat them up that said you need
to put these in multiple colors because
it will force you to actually start
thinking about how each segment relates
to each other and so they got out of the
building and again talked to different
users or potential users in different
locations and now you could see they
actually took our advice and segmented
the canvas in two separate colors
because they thought there were two
unique customer segments and now you can
see the customer segments sport Jersey
owners match the value prop for sports
Jersey owners and match the revenue
model and it's fairly easy to track
their thinking now the thinking by now
in the this third iteration it's a big
idea for facilitators and and coaches
it's no longer their opinion they now
have a hundred plus customers telling
them this and life is getting kind of
interesting because they now know more
than collectively than you do it's
actually no longer your opinion versus
theirs which it was on day one it's
actually they're now bringing you data
now it can be that they're just
misinterpreting the data or they might
be calling on the wrong people in the
wrong places that's your job as the
facilitator and and coach is to say well
wait a minute that's the wrong segment
or gee have you looked at you know your
activities or your resources because you
might have a great you know theory on
the right hand side but this thing won't
pencil out if you just do the numbers
and so we pushed them a bit on day three
and they actually went out and started
looking at the left-hand side of the
canvas because we beat the stuffing out
of them saying yeah yeah this might be
nice but there's no way you know you're
gonna end up spending more doing this
than you could bring in and so they went
out and actually talked to the left side
of the canvas and they actually found
out that oh yeah you were right it's not
FedEx we want to use because that's too
expensive but we also found
how much we can actually charge we had
people raise their hand and say we could
do that
and they and the other thing we push is
that by the second or third day or
second or third week we want them to
have launched their website or have
their app up and running and these guys
did exactly that literally in the third
day they had a working website and
within nine hours they had 81 visitors
even though it was all their relatives
and friends it didn't matter
they now had traffic to a site and they
actually received an order from the
first customer who wasn't even a
relative which was actually again
another sign of a teaching team standing
up and cheering so we literally all
stood up and applauded and then we
reminded them that the record inside of
a class was a purchase order for half a
million dollars so they still had four
hundred and ninety nine thousand dollars
to go but it was a good start and of
course it makes the other teams who are
barely able to get in like you know
talking to customers understand what the
scale of the game is that you really
need to be playing this seriously here
and again for facilitators and coaches
your goal is to keep the pressure on is
you got to keep it on be polite be
respectful but just remind them that the
pressure you're putting on them is about
1/100 the fund it's really going to be
like in a real startup and just
understand you're not trying to be mean
but part of your activity if you
remember is to figure out how these
teams operate in pressure and it might
just be but a good number of them aren't
suited for this stage of the company
what a cheap way to find out this is a
simulation of a startup and your job is
to make sure they understand that this
is just fractionally of the 24/7
sleepless nights that they're going to
be spending for the next couple years so
you could see after five days just five
days
after talking to a hundred and sixty
customers you could see how the business
model evolved dramatically from
something that looked like this on day
one to something that looked like this
on day five day one a series of untested
hypotheses a faith based enterprise on
day five the faith has turned into facts
and this startup is on the road to
actually building something
customers might want</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
