the same way as us when we investigated
birthdays let's make more sense of our
data especially for the span of people
born on the 1st we can break this
histogram into twelve histograms one for
each month of the year the code would
look like this
first I'm going to add a layer and that
layer is going to be called facet wrap
facet wrap takes a formula where we have
a tilde and then we're going to use the
variable that we're gonna split our data
over in this case DOB month we have the
number of columns set equal to three and
then we can run this code and see the
output so notice we took our one
histogram and split it into twelve
histograms since we set in call our the
number of columns equal to three we can
see the three columns in our one plot
now this one stands for January this two
would be for February and so on and if I
wanted to I could have used in call
equals four it would just give me a
slightly different plot with four
columns before we keep coding anymore I
want to focus on this facet wrap and
specifically this formula right here in
general faster wrap takes in a formula
inside of its parentheses the formula
contains a tilde sign followed by the
name of the variable that you want to
facet over this allows you to create the
same type of plot for each level of your
categorical variable in our case we
wanted to make histograms of DOB day one
for each month of the year a similar
layer to facet wrap is facet grid facet
grid also takes a formula but it's in a
little bit different form its formula
contains variables that we want to split
over in the vertical direction followed
by a tilde sign and then the name of the
variables we want to split in the
horizontal direction in general where
you place the variables can change how
the graph is laid out any orientation of
them now fasik grid is generally more
useful to use when you're faceting over
two or more variables if it's just one I
would use facet wrap you can learn more
about facet wrap facet grid and how to
format plots by following the link in
