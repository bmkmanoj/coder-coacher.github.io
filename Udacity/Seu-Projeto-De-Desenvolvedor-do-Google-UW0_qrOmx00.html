I just want to take a step back and say
thanks for bearing with us this is a ton
of information you've learned how to
create some really cool features using
the google maps api s using a drawing
layer making unique styles showing users
distances and directions and getting
back detailed places of interest
information you may be wondering what
this is well it's google's gift to you
and we'll show you it's the keys to the
castle you see now that you know how to
use them the google maps api eyes are
yours to use for free in the next few
lessons we'll go over some important
practical details you need to know while
flexing your creative muscles and using
location services and visualizations in
your sights so far you've been using the
API keys you generated in the very
beginning of the course to access most
of the functionality we've covered
you've also already enabled the api's
that we've used so far we're going to go
over the other important things that you
can and should be doing within the
Google developers console now that
you're a pro the first thing you should
be aware of is the ability to monitor
the usage of your API key you should
know that there is an allotted number of
what we call map loads that you can use
as a free user every time you load a
Google map using the initialize function
that we've seen to create a map object
you use one map load you have more than
enough quota to experiment freely and
develop apps see the documentation
linked in the instructor notes for
up-to-date amounts you can see how many
you use over time within the developers
console and we'll practice that soon
next in order to increase the security
of your API key you can whitelist
domains which are able to use it for
example after making my site I could
whitelist Emily's NYC house hunters calm
and then that will be the only site that
can make requests using that key when
making requests using that API key
they'll go through if any other domain
like a J's NYC house hunter calm
attempts to
you so they would get in there that way
nobody accidentally starts to use my key
using up all of my map loads or not so
accidentally it's always important to
protect yourself quota theft is not a
common occurrence but we care about
security here now as I said there is a
fair amount of quota are given for free
most websites and applications will stay
within this however if you consistently
generate a high amount of traffic usage
limits apply and you'll need to pay for
extra usage you can do this by enabling
billing within the developers console
you can also choose to put an end force
cap on your usage to make sure you don't
go over a certain limit see the
documentation in the instructor notes
for how to do this the next thing to be
aware up has to do with using the
services both client and server side in
general there are two types of caps that
we have on service usage queries per day
also known as QP D which is the total
number of requests made in one day and
queries per second or QPS which as it
sounds is the number of requests made in
one second the developer documentation
has specifics on the limitations for
each web service remember how we talked
about web service response codes before
right we wanted that ok response if you
ever see the over query limit response
code it means you've hit one of these QP
d or QPS limits now try logging into the
Google developers console and viewing
your projects usage so far</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
