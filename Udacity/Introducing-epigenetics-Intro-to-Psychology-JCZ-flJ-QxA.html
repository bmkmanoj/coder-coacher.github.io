psychologists are really interested in
these days is epigenetics
simply put epigenetics is interested in
the heritable change caused by the
environment in other words how the
environment affects if our genes are
turned on or off
that's right Lauren epigenetics is a
really new and exciting field of
genetics it's teaching us a lot about
how the environment influences gene
expression now it's really important to
remember that this is not mutation the
genetic sequence is unchanged what's
happening is the environment is
physically modifying the DNA in a way
that shuts a gene on or off so how does
that work well you can think about it
like chemicals that you take in from
your local environment so by chemicals
do you mean things like diet or even
chemical exposure sure like that even
things like exercise and metabolism can
produce these basic factors - and these
factors or chemicals physically modify
the DNA independent of the genetic
sequence and this will determine whether
or not a gene can be read so these
modifications make genes a product of
both nature right the genetic sequence
itself and nurture right the epigenetic
or environmental influence</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
