biological factors that play a role in
schizophrenia is the dopamine hypothesis
this hypothesis suggests that
schizophrenia involves excess dopamine
activity one reason this hypothesis came
about was from the observation of
individuals who overdose on major
stimulants like methamphetamine and
cocaine these individuals if you recall
from our lesson on drugs have similar
behaviors and cognitions as those
individuals with schizophrenia indeed
physicians have reported that it is
difficult upon initial observation to
determine whether somebody is
schizophrenic or whether they are
overdosing from a major stimulant
another factor supporting the idea of
the dopamine hypothesis in regards to
schizophrenia was that drugs that block
dopamine appeared to be effective in
treating the positive symptoms of
schizophrenia however there are some
problems with the dopamine hypothesis
and we will discuss that further in our
next lesson when we discuss treatments
for mental disorders another
neurotransmitter that does seem to play
a role in schizophrenia is glutamate it
appears that glutamate deficiencies may
also explain the symptoms of
schizophrenia that is glutamate is
important in learning memory neural
processing and brain development and it
allows us to make some stimuli more
important than others therefore
glutamate is crucial to selective
attention such as focusing attention on
some items of information while ignoring
others and it may explain why these
individuals have difficulty with
sustained attention cognitive control
and working memory now let's go back to
Lauren with the brain regions associated
with schizophrenia</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
