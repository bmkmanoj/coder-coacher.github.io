nanodegree my name is Chris and I'm
curriculum manager here at Udacity now
I've been lucky to have worked on some
cool Android devices like the nexus in
the samsung galaxy series but more
importantly I love building mobile
products they're increasingly more
personal they enrich your lives in so
many ways and they even feel a tad
magical now today I'm super excited to
help you begin your journey to build and
create your own immersive experiences
for this incredible platform now what's
even cooler is we've designed this
nanodegree with our friends at Google so
you know that you're learning directly
from the experts I think they want to
say hello now you learn about Android as
a platform for your ideas and become
aware of the vast canvas of api's
that'll be at your disposal before you
know it you're already in code that
could reach millions of people not only
on their phones but also on their
tablets TVs wearables and even in their
cars and when you finish the program
you'll be ready to start or advance your
career as an Android developer you'll
even have a killer portfolio projects to
prove it so why don't we go through them
you'll get your feet wet with an
introductory project that you'll build
in the first week in the nanodegree
you'll also build an app that helps you
just discover the most popular movies on
the web and optimize it for both phone
and tablet next they'll take two apps
and make them production ready by adding
features like Google Cloud messaging
error handling widgets accessibility and
localization support and a handy one to
properly use in integrate libraries
after that it's gonna be time to
supercharge your build process using the
Gradle build system to automate testing
signing dependency management and even
configuring your app with both a free
and paid version okay then you're gonna
focus on something that's critical to
every app the user experience something
we all evaluate viscerally you're going
to take an existing app and update it
using androids latest design language
material design you'll even learn how to
extend your apps to wearables TV and the
car finally we're gonna take everything
you've learned from building these
projects to develop a unique app
experience of your own and the capstone
project your app will also draw from
Google's extensive set of mobile
services which includes things like maps
location and context Analytics and AdMob
here's Mirim to tell you more about
details of the program building these
projects won't be easy we're going to
challenge you so you're prepared to
solve tough problems and think
independently to rise for that challenge
you'll need to keep up with your
learning schedule and engage with your
nanodegree community your fellow
students are here to help you untangle
the trickiest puzzles get over the
biggest hurdles and encourage you
through all of it and when they need
help you'll do the same for them the
Udacity team will be here too to deepen
your learning offer project feedback and
help you develop professionally by
leveraging these support systems and
working consistently you can prepare
yourself for an entirely new stage of
your career in a matter of months we
can't wait to see where your nano degree
takes you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
