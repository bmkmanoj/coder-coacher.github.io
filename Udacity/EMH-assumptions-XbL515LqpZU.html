the efficient markets hypothesis were
postulated by Jules regno in 1863 Eugene
fama carried those ideas further in the
1960s and it became his PhD thesis fama
recently received the Nobel Prize so we
know those ideas were good so what's the
efficient markets hypothesis about we'll
start by looking at some of the
assumptions that it makes probably the
most important assumption is that there
are a large number of investors
interacting in the market for profit so
they have an incentive to find
opportunities where the price of a stock
is out of line with what its true value
is and because there are so many of
these investors operating simultaneously
any time a little bit of information
comes out there the price is going to
move next assumption is that new
information arrives randomly so it
arrives at a random times it arrives at
random rates for different stocks but
it's constantly arriving and investors
are paying attention to that information
and therefore the prices are adjusting
quickly finally the efficient markets
hypothesis assumes that the current
price reflects all available information
in other words all this information this
trickling in is acted upon by the
investors the price adjusts quickly to
that information and the current price
reflects all information about that
stock</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
