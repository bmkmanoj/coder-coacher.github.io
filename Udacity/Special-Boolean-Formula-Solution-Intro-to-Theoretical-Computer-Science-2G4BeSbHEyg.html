three of those statements those three
down here are correct I'll explain them
in a minute and this one here is not
correct so the formula indeed does have
a satisfying assignment not only one it
actually has several satisfying
assignments but each of those
assignments has the property that
exactly one variable is set to true and
I'll show you in a second how that works
and of course I mean the last thing was
probably quite easy to figure out as you
see this already has a kind of square
shape so if we continue like this and
add another variable here then we would
have to add another line down here and
each of those formulas grows by one and
the whole thing grows by by one of those
brackets here for each variable that we
add so the size is o of N squared for n
variables so let me explain this here to
you so there are several satisfying
assignments but each of those satisfying
assignments has the property that
exactly one variable is true so for
example let's say that we set x 12 true
then what will happen is the following
so X 1 is true this means this one down
here goes to 0 this one goes to 1 this
one goes to 1 this one goes to 1 this
one goes to one and this one as well so
let's have a look here at this part of
the formula all of the variables here
are connected by an or so we have X 1 or
x3 or x4 or x5 or x6 this means if just
one of the variables here is set to true
which it now is then the whole bracket
here so from here to here will also
evaluate to true and then we take this
very very big not here which means this
will evaluate to 0 now if this very big
not here evaluates to 0 then we have to
make sure that this variable here
evaluates to 1 because all of them are
connected by an end and we are looking
for a satisfying assignment so to do
that we have to set x 220 so that this
here evaluates to 1 now for the next
bracket it works the same way because
again we have x1 set to true so the
bracket evaluates to true so the not a
value
20 and so again we have to set this to
one which means x 3 is 1 and we can go
on through this the same way so the
formula forces us to set every variable
except for x12 false and now the way
that this formula is structured of
course we could also have chosen to set
X 22 true but then if X 2 is set to true
we have this year so so X 2 here is 1
1111 which means in order to get these
here to go to one so we need to have
these here go to 1 because this here
evaluates to 0 0 0 0 0 so we have to set
all of these variables here to false
yeah finally what about this one here
well since X 2 is set to true not x 2 is
set to false but luckily because we've
set all other variables to false so we
have 0 0 0 0 0 in this case the large
not here evaluates to true so this
bracket here also evaluates to true and
we have satisfied the boolean formula</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
