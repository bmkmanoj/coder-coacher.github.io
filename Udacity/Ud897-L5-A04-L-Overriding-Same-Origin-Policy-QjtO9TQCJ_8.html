to access your resources even if they
are from another origin this is mostly
irrelevant for API providers who want
other sites to be able to use the
service but the same origin policy
prevents this nowadays we can easily
achieve this sharing of regions with a
set of AGP headers called cross-origin
resource sharing or course for short
this is the most powerful and generic
solution to the single origin problem
but up until a few years ago the browser
support for cause water as a lacking and
people had to come up with their own
techniques to work around the single
origin policy in the meantime one of the
oldest techniques is called Jason P
Jason with padding instead of simply
returning data jsonp returns script
containing the data this exploits the
fact that the scripts from other origins
will execute and share the execution
environment with your own scripts jsonp
based ap is expected to include a
function named as a query parameter the
server will return a new script calling
the function that you named let's look
at a fictional example let's say we are
building an app at your course list comm
that wants to list all the Udacity
courses the user is enrolled in the
naive approach would be to make a fetch
request to API udacity.com and use the
return data to generate a list for the
user however this will fail with a
security exception as your host differs
from Udacity host how would this API
look if it supports jsonp add a function
named to the URL and included with a
script tag the server will wrap all the
data it means to return in a function
call with the same name as given via the
query parameter you need to define this
function because when the response is
returned the function call is executed
and you now have access to the data for
the parameter of that function</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
