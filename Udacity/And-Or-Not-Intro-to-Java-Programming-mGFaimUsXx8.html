are four different conditions all four
had to be true so I joined them with the
and operator let's start with the ex's
ex has to be at least width / 3 and it
should be at most twice that the Y value
should be at least hide over 3 and it
should be at most twice that so here are
my four conditions joined by and when
all of them are true then the pixel
should be blue otherwise it should be
white now you may be wondering what's
the deal with the greater equals versus
less dense particularly if you didn't do
it just so and your answer wasn't
counted correctly this is easiest to see
with a specific example so let's say we
have a 300 by 300 flag that means that
the X&amp;amp;Y positions range from 0 to 2 99
we want each of these three areas to
have equal size so the first one goes
from 0 to 99 the next one from 100 100
99 and the last one from 200 to 299 so
to be within the second of these you
want to be great or equal hundred and
less than 200 that's why you have a
greater equal here and it left in there
I know it seems like a fine point but it
is worth paying attention to and here is
what it looks like when i run it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
