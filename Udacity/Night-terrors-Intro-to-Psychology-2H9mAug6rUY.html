terrors this occurs most often in
childhood and results in waking from
sleep in a terrified state most of these
occur in the first third of the night
now if this happens the person might be
difficult to comfort because they're
going to be thrashing around violently
this could last 10 to 20 minutes and
then they'll fall back asleep oftentimes
the person will have no memory of the
event and can't explain what happened
the following morning and some people
with night terrors also sleepwalk in
which they engage in behaviors they
would do while they're awake even though
they're asleep for example this could
include eating getting dressed moving
furniture or even driving a car while
asleep now sleepwalking can occur in
children and adults
about 4 to 15 percent of children
sleepwalk and about 1.5 to 2.5 percent
of adults sleepwalk now let's go to my
friend who has night terrors and let's
see what he has to say about them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
