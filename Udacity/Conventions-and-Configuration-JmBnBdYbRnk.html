magic how the great will know where to
find your sources and how the gray will
know what compiler options to use or
what directory to put your build outputs
cradle uses the philosophy of convention
over configuration or as I prefer to
think about it
cradle has sensible opinionated defaults
you can lay out a Java project however
you please but by default Gradle will
assume your sources and source main Java
and your tests in source tests Java and
your outputs in the build directory
cradle isn't married to that idea
however and you can easily tell Gradle
that your sources live somewhere else
there's a big upside to following the
Gradle defaults though it means you can
pick up any other Gradle Java project
and be pretty confident that you already
know how the project is laid out it also
means that if the project deviates from
the defaults that configuration is
obvious in the build script Gradle also
does its best to separate capabilities
from opinions the Java plug-in actually
first applies to Java base plugin the
java base plug-in is what provides the
ability to compile Java and adds the
concept of source sets to the project
however it doesn't add any source sets
in particular the opinionated
conventions are applied by the Java
plugin</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
