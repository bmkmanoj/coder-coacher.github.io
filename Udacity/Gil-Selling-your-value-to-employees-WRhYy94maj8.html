job in the startup hopefully knows what
they're going into it's a very different
environment compensation wise clearly
but also the scope of work and and what
every person gets to work on the good
news is startup work and big corporate
work are very different things not good
or bad just different and I think I'll
employees recognize that making sure you
explain what it takes to be an employee
in your startup how it's different than
company X perhaps that that person
worked with before and more in them and
just as important acknowledging the
risks identified in corporate perhaps
there's less risk in style up life
significantly more risk but also great
rewards if the startup does well so
making sure the employee understand that
risk reward balance and how that shifts
between corporate to startup is really
critical</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
