really tricky especially if you don't
have a good place to start but it's a
lot easier if you have the help from
someone like a genetic genealogist and
today we're lucky enough to be joined
remotely with Cece Moore a genetic
genealogist hi CeCe
hi Matt how are you I'm doing pretty
good you know we're pretty excited to be
learning all about this ancestry and
human evolution and we're really curious
at this point you know what is it that a
genetic genealogist does a genetic
genealogist uses DNA testing in
conjunction with traditional genealogy
research in order to learn more about
our roots and so does this mean you have
to go through a service like 23andme or
another similar service like Family Tree
DNA comm what do you need as an
individual who's interested in finding
out more along the lines of genetic
genealogy well you need to take a
direct-to-consumer genetic genealogy
test so yes that can be 23andme ancestry
DNA or Family Tree DNA also also
National Geographic Geno 2.0 although
that's more focused on ancient ancestry
than it is applicable to our family
trees I see and how do how do you get in
touch with people how do you interact
with people do they come to you with
questions you help them find relatives
we have a very active genetic genealogy
community we have lots of forums and
mailing lists and there's people posting
questions and answers all day long on
these lists so that's the best way to
get involved and really learn how we're
using DNA testing for genealogy also to
get answers from a lot of the experts we
have really an amazing community with
incredibly intelligent and knowledgeable
people who are willing to help for free
on these lists so that's really how I
would recommend getting started
you know sign up take the test with one
of the companies and while you're
waiting for your results get on one of
the lists and start learning right away
no what kind of consumers end up
interested in this kind of things you
find mainly just people with the generic
interest or do you find a lot of maybe
adopted individuals I think all of the
above when we first started with genetic
genealogy the early
were highly educated a lot of times
retired scientists of not geneticists
but other types of scientists and
professionals from other industries and
now as we've gone further with it and
it's gotten more visibility among the
general populace we have a lot more
people coming in from all walks of life
all different types of jobs different
ages and certainly adoptees because DNA
testing for an adoptee is just a
revelation especially for one who had no
knowledge of their biological roots now
that raises an interesting question I
think for me and other people is we
don't often put a lot of thought into
the considerations ethical or otherwise
even just emotional or psychological
what are some of the important aspects
that you think people should be thinking
about whenever they're approaching this
idea of finding family members and
trying to reach out and grow their
family I always say expect unexpected
surprises I give a lot of speeches about
genetic genealogy and I've incorporated
that in everyone now and lots of my
writings about genetic genealogy as well
and that's because my experience has
been that you just don't know what
you're going to find there have been a
tremendous number of people who have
found close family members who have no
idea that that other person existed so
be prepared and if you're not prepared
to learn the truth then you probably
shouldn't test I see now that makes it
sound very interesting I take it not all
the responses or reactions are always
positive the vast majority have been
positive but sometimes it just takes
some getting used to when you don't know
that you have a half-sibling
or a child out there sometimes or a
first cousin nephew and uncle all of
these types of relationships have been
discovered it's a shock of course I've
been a part of a lot of great reunions
where everyone was thrilled to meet each
other but you know it's not an easy
thing you to add a new family member
especially someone so close is there any
particular relationship that you help
people find or that you just find that
other people end up discovering on their
own that seems to be more profound than
other kinds of
relationships I think a parent-child
relationship is the most profound one
you can find particularly a mother
though I think it's also true for
fathers but when mothers have carried a
child for nine months and then given it
up for adoption it's an extremely
emotional thing to rediscover that
person so I think it does take a lot of
adapting sometimes those birth mothers
have been searching for their child they
gave up for decades and or even if they
weren't searching was hoping that that
child would find them and so they're
thrilled but a lot of times they already
have another family so they have a
husband and they have children and they
don't always know about the existence of
that other family member so it takes a
little bit of time and sensitivity to
integrate that new family member I I
actually have not personally seen any
negative responses from birth mothers or
children being reunited there have been
some birth fathers who didn't know of
the child's existence who have had a
harder time accepting the truth of it
and if they don't understand genetics
and they don't understand you know the
test that we're using I think sometimes
it's hard to convince these people that
yes this is your child and I have been a
part of a situation where the father
denied the birth father denied at the
time that he could have been the father
and that's partly why the child was
given up for adoption
and when this adoptee found a match at
23andme which turned out to be a
paternal aunt he was still unable to
accept the truth of this although the
whole extended family has now accepted
that this adopt D into their family and
one of the really interesting things
about that case is I used the mtDNA and
the X chromosome inheritance in order to
narrow down exactly what the
relationship was between these people
because they shared I think it was 28%
about of their DNA so as you know there
could be a couple of different
relationships in this case and by
looking at the X chromosome inheritance
we were able to narrow it down and say
that this is definitely a paternal aunt
and she had her other brother test so
also paternal uncle
confirmed it and the father still denied
it the birth father so they hired a
geneticist to look over it and he
thought that I was being too specific
with my claim but I think that's because
he doesn't understand how we're using
DNA testing for genealogy and for these
adoption searches and so later when we
found the birth mother which we found
when she transferred her raw data at a
family tree DNA's family finder
believe it or not we found a maternal
first cousin so in half an hour I was
able to locate the birth mother and when
she was contacted she confirmed that the
person we had identified as the birth
father was indeed and they had gone to
the same College same year and it was
very clear so that case has mostly
turned out great she's had a wonderful
reunion with her mother and with her
paternal extended family but the father
still has never admitted that he is
indeed the father so it's sensitive yeah
yeah I mean it seems amazing I mean
obviously the the information is very
powerful the the genetic tracing I'm
curious to know from your perspective do
you ever what percentage of people do
you think sign up for these 23andme
services and don't quite know that
they're getting themselves into a
paternity test of sorts is that common
or uncommon I think most people don't
realize the power of these types of
tests there's different reasons that
people test as you know they might be
testing for health reasons if it's
23andme
whereas they might not realize the
genealogical implications and it's not
always that a match finds their birth
parent there with an adoptee for
instance or a donor conceived individual
we may find a more distant relative that
they're related to and still be able to
triangulate this adopt these matches and
identify the probable birth parents so
you could be identified even if you
don't test and I think that is just
something that our society is going to
have to get used to it it's just the way
things are going and I believe very
strongly in truth
I'm not a scientist by training but
science is about truth and I don't think
that it's something that we should deny
it's something that we should definitely
be moving towards and knowledge is power
so hopefully everyone will agree with me
and get tested and not be upset if they
get contacted by a family member that
they didn't know about exactly we are
definitely in a new information age
where all of this can really change our
outlooks and our family structures in
lots of different ways
what um you know for those of us I I
sort of just realized for those of us
who don't know very much about genealogy
at all how how far out do you go in a
family structure as a genetic
genealogist are you interested in you
know up to grandparents and maybe second
cousins or do you you you build out
farther than that do you connect whole
families kind of just give us some idea
how far out you go well we're interested
in our family trees as far back as we
can go so with why DNA testing which has
been used in genetic genealogy much
longer than autosomal DNA tests like
23andme we're looking way back we could
be looking back into the 1400s even
because as you know the Y chromosome
changes very slowly therefore a father
and son will probably have an identical
Y chromosome and maybe a grandparent and
a great grandparent and a second
great-grandfather on that direct
paternal line so we've used these
surname studies to go many many
generations back centuries back with
autosomal DNA we're not looking quite so
far back because of the recombination
however when we first started using
autosomal DNA for genetic genealogy we
were told that it was only going to work
maybe five generations six generations
back and especially with our adoption
DNA research we have proven that it
works much further back we're able to
identify ancestral couples a couple
centuries ago actually in these trees
and the way we do that is for instance
if an adoptee knows nothing about their
biological heritage we would take all of
their family trees of their DNA matches
so everyone who's willing to share at
23andme or
DNA or ancestry DNA and we would start
comparing those trees looking for
commonalities and intersections among
their matches trees since they don't
know anything about their family tree
and if we see a certain ancestral couple
over and over and over and over we can
be pretty sure that that's probably one
of their ancestors as well and if not
their ancestors certainly in an
ancestral line one of their branches of
their family tree would have that
ancestral line in it and we've used
couples very far back like late 1600s
1700s and been able to build down to the
present time that takes a lot of work
believe me and we wouldn't just do it
with one couple we would do it with
various couples build their descendants
down to the present and try to see where
there's intersections between the
descendents from those ancestral couples
and if we can do that which we sometimes
can we can sometimes solve these
adoption search cases without a close
relative match if we get second cousin
or closer we can almost always solve it
if we're only working with third cousins
fourth cousins fifth cousins and more
distant it takes a lot more work but it
has been done that's really amazing you
know we have an individual an art course
named sterling who is actually submitted
his DNA sample to 23andme and gotten
results back and he has been able to
find a as close a match as a second
cousin on the relative finder now if you
were chatting with him and he was
looking for a next step what advice
would you give to him to sort of deal
with trying to reach out to that person
or possibly you know finding other
connections that he could get more
information from there's a couple
different things he should do first of
all he may want to join one of our
adoption DNA mailing lists we have
extremely helpful search Angels on those
lists who started out as traditional
adoption search angels so they know how
to work with the records and if he has
any non identifying information that can
really help to use that in conjunction
with his DNA results so we can help to
teach him on those lists what he needs
to do next
and sometimes you know do more than just
teach him but hand hold and if he gets
real close to the answer one of the
search angels will jump in and help and
when I say real close a second cousin is
really close so he probably could find
someone who'd be willing to help him
work through these matches and try to
identify his birth parents and the way
we would do that is we would take that
second cousin match do you happen to
know what the percentage is that's in
common
I believe it's it's around
I think it's above 1% ish okay so we
would look at the percent and try to
determine if it's a solid second cousin
match or if it might be a second cousin
once removed or a third cousin so if his
matches around 1% that could be a second
cousin it could be a second cousin
once-removed could be a third cousin
could be a first cousin twice removed
depending on the different ages so we
would look at all of those possibilities
and we would want that matches family
tree back to great-grandparents or
preferably great-great grandparents
because they may if there are true
second cousins they will share
great-grandparents but if they're second
cousins once removed it might be his
great-great grandparent and their great
grandparent or the other way around
or if there's a bunch of removals it
could even be a little further back in
the tree so as much as we can get of
that family tree built from traditional
genealogy we want if his match doesn't
have it then we would build that for
them so then we would look at all of
those great-grandparents first and we
would build towards the present with
their descendants and we would try to
find somebody in the right place at the
right time who could be this adoptees
birth parent so we don't know if it's
gonna be the mother or the father so
we'd have to look at both in this case
if it's an adoptee who already knows
their birth mother which happens quite a
bit then we know we're just looking for
a male in the right place at the right
time time of the right age to be their
birth parent and if we don't find anyone
from those great-grandparents
descendants we have to go back one
generation and go to great-great
grandparents and try building them to
the present and if we still have trouble
what I would do is start looking at his
other matches preferably his next
closest matches but all of his matches
are important and we build spreadsheets
so this is a little complicated but this
is what we do we get all of the matching
segments data into a spreadsheet and we
sort it so it's in order chromosome one
start you know the beginning of the
chromosome to the end of the chromosome
so like one base pair all the way out to
the very end two hundred and thirty
thousand whatever it is and we go to the
next one and chromosome two three four
or five and then we start looking at
people who are overlapping on these
matching segments and we try to find
groups of people who all would match
each other now since we know that
there's two chromosomes at each spot
right it might look like they're
matching but they're not so we have to
then triangulate meaning do in common
with if it's Family Tree DNA they have a
feature where you can compare the
matches and see if they match or at
23andme
it's even better because we can actually
compare them to see if they match on the
same spot so if I'm sharing with someone
and sharing with someone else I can
compare them so then we break those
groups up into a paternal and maternal
chromosome now we don't usually know
which is paternal which is maternal so
we just call them a and B so we'll have
chromosome 1 a and chromosome 1 B and
we'll have groups of overlapping matches
now what we would do is try to get the
family tree information the regular
genealogy are from documentary research
and compare these family trees of the
matches since the adopt you doesn't have
one and we look for commonalities and
overlaps so if we can find an ancestral
couple that appears in some of these
overlapping matches then we know that
that also has to be in the adoptees
family tree and why is that that's
because each piece of DNA can only come
from one of our ancestors right now it's
probably an ancestral couple so we won't
know if it's from the man or the woman
of the couple but that's okay because we
know that this couple then goes in their
family tree and in this way we can give
adoptees
family tree back piece by piece so even
if we can't automatically tell them who
their birth parents are we can start
giving them pieces of their heritage
back which is incredibly meaningful for
adoptees I found and I think it's hard
for those of us who aren't adopted to
understand that but I've had a lot of
adoptee say to me I have ancestors like
it's so strange for them to know that
they have ancestors and this also works
well for African Americans who can't get
their genealogy past slavery I've been
able to identify a lot of their European
ancestors by doing this and we don't
know where they fit in the tree yet so
they're just sort of floating around in
space you know not connected to which
branch of the tree but eventually if you
keep doing this you'll be able to attach
these ancestors to the correct branches
of the trees so it's really fascinating
and exciting for genealogists adoptees
anyone who has unknown parentage
to discover these things that they
didn't know about I love it that was a
great answer I mean it sounds like so
much work but it sounds like it really
pays off to everyone involved you get a
lot of information there's a lot of
value in that and sort of reestablishing
your eye your identity and your family
structure you know I have to ask I've
never met anybody who's so confident in
their ability to actually say second
cousin once-removed third cousin twice
from them you know and just my
preparation for this course you know I
got tried to get back into understanding
those different relationships how long
did it take you to actually learn all
those different cousin relationships and
does it make sense to you
it does and as a genealogist that's
something we deal with anyway but I
don't think I have a really strong
confident grasp on it until I started
doing genetic genealogy and it's so
important for autosomal DNA because it's
going to have with it you know the
amount of DNA we expect to see on
average in common is going to have with
each removal so you have to understand
that that a second cousin is going to
have an average of expected DNA of
3.125% I've seen it down to about 1% and
I
it up to almost 5% so there's this huge
range but if it's a second cousin
once-removed we're only expecting to see
about half of that so about 1.6 percent
you really have to get a grasp on it if
you're going to do this work
now there's charts that we have on our
International Society of genetic
genealogists I helped to found the wiki
in 2010 so we have the charts on there
if you ask on one of the lists someone
will help you with that it's also on my
blog so the informations out there you
don't have to have it memorized and I do
have it memorized because I've done it
so much but it still gets overwhelming
and I someone writes me and says help me
figure this out I think I have a first
cousin once removed I'm still sitting
there like writing it down on paper you
know because it helps so much to be able
to visualize it and get it there and I
go okay this person is descended from
this person there must be two people in
between and here's the match's family
tree and count back and you know it does
get confusing so you just have to be
really organized about it and use all
the resources available that we have out
there
sure and I'm a very visual person too so
when I think about it it definitely
helps to see the graph in front of me or
be able to see those connections
now we've skirted around it and you just
mentioned it there um you actually run a
very popular blog called your genetic
genealogist and I'd love for you to tell
us a little bit more about how you
started that blog and what it means to
you and what people use it for today I
guess that means I have to start at the
beginning a little bit which is that I
was a genealogist just hobbyist and I've
always loved genetics it's not my career
in the past I wasn't trained in it but
I've always been drawn to it and always
really loved it and so when autosomal
DNA was introduced for genealogical
purposes by 23andme I jumped in with
both feet I was so excited it was
actually Catherine Borges who is the
director of I saw who first showed me
what they were doing and i just fell
madly in love and it completely took
over my life so it went from being a
hobby to a full-time volunteer position
and
now a career and part of that was
starting my blog I was answering a lot
of questions all the time of people who
needed help right away
and so I wanted a way to be able to
answer those questions and not have to
keep repeating the same answers over and
over I was also doing some really
fascinating research with my own family
and wanted to have a place to write that
up and I was corresponding with 23andme
a lot people who worked over there right
away I established a good relationship
with them and it was actually one of
them who recommended that I start a blog
it was Alex
from 23 he's not there anymore but he
was one of the early employees there and
he said you know you should write a blog
and so I'd never done anything like that
and I enjoyed it right off the bat it
was so fun to share my research and get
input from everybody and help people
learn what to do with their results as
well and it's grown into something I
never could have imagined looking at my
analytics it's just amazing almost from
the very beginning there was people from
Stanford and Harvard and governmental
agencies reading it universities all
over the world so it just literally blew
my mind I mean I thought I would just
have a few genealogist reading it but I
think it was the right time the right
thing at the right time there weren't
many blogs Blaine Bettinger the genetic
genealogists had been writing since 2007
but he was really the only one doing it
and he's an attorney so he was pretty
busy and wasn't writing as much so there
was a real opening for me so it was one
of those niche things that just worked
out and turned out to be this amazing
thing that I never could have planned
well I know so many people are happy
that you started including us we're
actually going to use it as a resource
for our students who are really
interested in the topic so I hope that
they'll oh you students out there will
make good use of that now what I'd love
to do is actually pivot a little bit now
and we'll talk about sort of the sort of
more career side of this as you sort of
gotten into explaining a bit how you how
you got to this point
now you mentioned can I add one thing
about my blog I'm sorry to interrupt
sure I just wanted to say so early on I
started asking relatives to test right
away I realized that that was going to
add a lot to my research so now I have
about 3540 pretty close family members
tested but on my blog I started a second
cousin study so every time I would test
a second cousin I would write up the
results from that and I would show the
range of sharing sometimes it's slow
sometimes it's high but the exciting
thing about it for genealogists was I
started talking about how when you test
a second cousin you can identify the DNA
that you received from each of your
great-grandparent ancestral couples and
that's that's an exciting thing for a
genealogist because we have spent
thousands and thousands of hours
researching these people and a great
grandparents aren't that far back
they're not that far out of our reach
but most of us never got to meet them
and of course we know that they are
inside of us but we've never had
tangible evidence of it before so to be
able to say look on chromosome 10 from 1
million to 20 million I know I got this
DNA from my Proctor great grandparents
on my mom's side and my Allen great
grandparents on my dad's side to me that
was fascinating I sound sort of like
nerdy techy but for genealogists it
really has been meaningful and I think
it's just going to get more meaningful
as we learn more about genetics I mean
we all know how fast genetics is
advancing so I think that will start to
mean a lot to us in real life we'll be
able to say hey you know I know I have
that DNA in that area from this
particular great grandparent or a great
great grandparent depending how far back
you've been able to trace it and that
means that I got say the shape of my
nose for instance I'm just making this
up you know but that particular gene
from those specific ancestors and so for
those of us who just loved our ancestors
and would dig in dusty boxes for hours
on end to find tiny little tidbits this
is extremely meaningful for us so I
think that's why genetic genealogy in
part why it has exploded the way it has
for our group our community yeah I
I completely I did I completely agree
you know in lesson 11 for our course we
actually go over an example where you
have grandchildren who have blue eyes
and both parents have brown eyes and the
question is is in general I color is
controlled by several genes but a couple
of really important ones and we can
actually trace exactly which grandparent
and which grandparent that eye color
gene came from which grandparent gave
you that allele you can trace it all the
way back and it really is fascinating it
gives you a new idea instead of this
sort of mysterious oh I know I got this
from my great-grandparents but I don't
know which one or even on which side and
you're like I know my great-aunt you
know my my great-grandmother norma gave
me my blue eyes and it just gives you a
new sense of identity exactly i'm so
happy to hear that because i always talk
about that in my speeches but i'm like i
said i'm not a geneticist so i don't
know the exact genes that are you know
controlling each of these traits but i
know that some of the information is out
there and all the time there's more and
more and more because an Anne Wojcicki
from 23andme has this slide she shows in
her presentations where she says what we
knew a couple years ago and it's just
like a few dots here and there across
the genome and what we know now like
what's been identified to be significant
and it's just full of them now so
although that that's not my area of
expertise I know that this is meaningful
and it's just going to get more and more
so so hearing that from you it just
confirms what I thought great I'm glad
to hear that well I'm you know we're
really intrigued that you say you know
genetics is a passion of yours but it
wasn't actually what you studied can you
tell us a bit more about what you did
before you got into this and sort of
what your segue was were you just a
super super nerd spend all your free
time in genetics or was this just a
really fun hobby for you genetics was
always something that I was interested
in but I had not studied it in fact I
was a music and theater major in college
and I had fallen in love with genetics
just prior to that in my senior year in
high school when I was in ap bio we had
a little of genetics
section as part of our coursework and I
absolutely loved it so I should have
taken the clue then and I I loved it
enough that I did think about changing
my major and I even investigated it but
I already had a scholarship for music at
USC and they didn't have a genetics
undergraduate program all right very
well may have done it but I just stuck
with my original plan and many years
later here I end up back again in loving
genetics but this time it took over my
life so I had started as a genealogist
in 2002 I think was when I really got
involved and I was looking at making a
family tree for my niece's wedding and I
the type of person who jumps in with
both feet and I did that and got kind of
obsessed and did genealogy for a few
years before I got really interested in
the genetics part of it we were just
using Y DNA and mtDNA at the time which
I still thought was interesting but I
wasn't quite as fascinated as I am with
autosomal DNA and that's really become
my focus although I used the other types
in conjunction with it many times
especially in adoption
searches so how did I get into it so I
started writing the blog and I got so
many questions from people and so much
interest that it literally started
taking over my life I had tons of
comments on the blog I had tons of
private emails of people wanting help
particularly people who were searching
for close family members like adoptees
and people who had discovered close
family members and hadn't expected it
there's so many people out there that
this is happening to you'd be surprised
and I sometimes wonder if there's much
more of that in our society than we
realize but then I think it's also
possible that the people who are drawn
to testing are the people who maybe felt
a little different or felt like
something was missing in their lives so
it's hard to say which it is but anyway
the result was that I was completely
overwhelmed so I had been an actress for
many years and then when I had my son I
had transitioned behind the camera and
was producing commercials and my poor
partner has had to completely
over our production business because I
work about 18 hours a day seven days a
week doing a genetic genealogy now and I
never would have imagined it would
become my career I don't have a science
background I've certainly taken science
classes and always loved them but that
wasn't the direction I took with my
career so to go from entertainment and
then end up in a science career in my
40s is definitely not something I would
have ever imagined but it is so
fascinating every day I wake up in the
morning and I immediately want to jump
out of bed and run down to my computer
and see what new fascinating things had
have transpired overnight and believe me
there is always something I'm very
involved with all of the genetic
genealogy mailing lists so I spend a lot
of time answering questions on those and
I do help adoptees for free so a lot of
my time is spent as a volunteer I do
some consulting but probably the most
amazing thing that's come from it is I
am now the genetic genealogy consultant
on finding your roots with Henry Louis
Gates Jr and also genealogy roadshow and
there's also another Fox pilot which I
don't know if anything will come of it
so there are currently three television
shows that I'm doing consulting for and
so now my entertainment background and
this new career that I never planned on
have kind of come together in a way I
would never have imagined so it's been
quite a ride I mean amazing they say
sometimes you just fall into something
and I wish I'd fallen into it in my 20s
but it's still great that I eventually
got where I am now what do you think
about the current state of genetic
genealogists in the country or in the
world do you think that we're in need of
more people who can serve the same kind
of role you and your blog serve yeah
that's a terrific question Matt and it
is something that I think about every
day because I have so many people coming
to me for help I can't possibly help
them all I stay up all hours of the
night and I you know don't do a lot of
social activities so I can help these
people it's really
fulfilling and I prioritize the ones who
have a really emotionally important
question like they have discovered
something of great significance to their
close family and I just can't keep up
with it and I need people that are doing
what I'm doing that I can send these
people to and I have a couple colleagues
that I am able to refer people to and
there's a great network of search angels
who have learned to do genetic genealogy
who are also helping adoptees and those
like them who have an unknown parentage
usually unknown father sometimes donor
conceived individuals but it's even more
than just that I have a lot of just you
know people interested in their ancestry
and in their genealogy who are either
our genealogists or aren't and are just
interested in learning more because
they've heard about DNA testing there's
such a huge demand for this and maybe a
year ago some people had come to me and
asked me you know if they wanted to have
a career in genetic genealogy was there
was there a demand for it and it's
changed really then maybe a year ago two
years ago there wasn't much of a demand
for it and in the last year or two it
has literally exploded so now I
absolutely would say that there is room
for genetic genealogy consultants people
who are willing to learn what we're
doing and if they have a background in
genealogy that would be great and if
they don't that's fine too they'll have
to learn both sides of it so they'll
have to learn the DNA part and the
genealogy part but if they're
adventurous and they're looking for a
new career and they love detective work
because that's exactly what this is then
I would strongly recommend that they
look into this as a career well great
sort of as our parting words here in the
same vein is there any other specific
advice or resources you would give to
someone who's particularly moved by this
subject and wants to investigate about
the possibility of studying more there's
some places that they can go to sort of
learn more about how to become a genetic
genealogist that you recommend yes
because the field is so fast-moving
there are very few books that really
address the subject and
we have someone asking you know is there
a genetic genealogy for dummies book and
there isn't not yet at least
and that's because those of us who've
tried to write them find that they are
so quickly outdated that trying to get
something published is very difficult
that's up to date so we always recommend
that you read the blogs you read my blog
Blaine's blog Roberta s T's blog there's
some other really good ones out there
kitty Cooper has recently started
writing some fantastic resources and
most of all join our mailing lists
because that's where you really get help
from the experts and the people who have
been doing this from the very beginning
are very generous with their time and
they're on those lists so join the
International Society of genetic
genealogy it's free it's AI SOG is OGG
org and then you'll get an invitation to
join the DNA newbie list which I happen
to administer and you can go there and
ask the most basic questions and we have
people who've been on the list for quite
a while so we also have more
intermediate discussions and sometimes
even venture into more advanced so just
keep reading everything you can that's
how I learned this I got on the list and
I made myself read every single message
whether it made sense to me or not and
it didn't at first but I think it works
like you know osmosis for lack of a
better word it starts to seep in after a
while and it starts to make sense and
you don't even know how that happened
because it you didn't even know what you
were reading but our brains work you
know mysterious ways and I promise you
if you get on the list and you read
everything that everyone's writing
especially people like Ann Turner who
was one of the first pioneer genetic
genealogists and she wrote the book
tracing your roots with DNA and she's on
those lists I mean you can't access a
better resource than her and a lot of my
other colleagues Tim Jansen is amazing
he's on those lists so join us and we'll
help you learn great Cece it's been a
pleasure chatting with you I hope you'll
join us again maybe in the discussion
forms for our course that would be great
