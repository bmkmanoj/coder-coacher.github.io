one out it turns out as I said there's
lots of different ways to make this work
but what we're gonna do is move that
line that we had for conjunction if we
what we really want to do now is figure
out how to move it down so that now
these three points are in the green zone
they're gonna output one because they're
the or and the only one in the that's
left in the zero zone in the in the red
zone is the zero zero case so how we're
gonna be able to do that well since we
want it to be the case that either of x2
or x1 being one gets you above the line
then we need a threshold and a set of
weights that put either one of them over
you don't have that both of them you
only need one of them so let's imagine a
case where X 1 is 1 and X 2 is 0 then
basically whether you're right there's a
whole lot of answer so a weight of 1 for
X 1 would give you a 1 right yes uh-huh
and so if we made the threshold 1 that
would work what about weight - well we
do is exactly the same thing so we set
weight 2 equal to 1 and that means that
in the case where both of them are 0 you
get 0 plus 0 which gives you something
less than 1 if one of them is 1 and the
other is 0 you get 1 which gives you
right at the threshold and if both of
them are 1 then you get 2 which is still
greater than 1 good all right that seems
like it works the other way we could do
it is we can keep the weight at in
another way we can do it is keep the
weights where they were before that just
moves this line nice and smoothly down
and then right so before we had a
threshold of 1 and 1/2 now we need a
threshold of like a half ought to do it
yeah or even less as long as it's
greater than 2 your so quarter should
work as well so good so lots lots of
different ways to do that and cool can
we do not what's not of too variable
that's a good question let's do not have
one variable then ok</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
