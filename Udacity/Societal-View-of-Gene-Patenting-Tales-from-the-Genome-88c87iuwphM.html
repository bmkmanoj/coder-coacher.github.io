personal opinion about gene patenting or
the idea of you know can a company owned
a gene specifically you know the bracket
gene has been the subject of much debate
Oh Myriad Genetics was just denied the
right to patent the Bronco mutation and
I agree with that completely why is that
well I don't I don't I think this
information should be available and you
don't patent the gene a treatment or
medicine for a period of time but a gene
is is something that we have in our body
you know it's part of human nature it's
our human it's in your human it's part
of your makeup and I don't think that
they should be able to patent a gene all
living things have changed trees and
have cells with DNA and them cats dogs
bacteria what do you think about
patenting those jeans do you feel
similarly ER differently I mean it would
I think the way that the decision went
so that you can't patent something
that's already naturally occurring I
think that's already that's been in the
law for a long time I think when you get
into the recombinant DNA technology and
bioengineering where you're changing the
genetic code of something that is
currently allowed to be patented and I
think innovations like that definitely
those are pure innovations that deserve
passes that should be protected even if
it's one letter change that one letter
change yeah if that one letter change
changes the essence or the function of I
mean like I said my wife's a yeast Jonas
is so small changes make big differences
so if you can change something like that
and if it's enough even truth sickle
cell anemia one small change bracken
mutation and fgfr3 mutation they can
major effects i saw sterling nodding his
head over there you you agree with that
assessment yeah I would just think I
give an analogy like you need to happen
like a type of leaf or you know patent a
part of your body patent the liver I
mean this is something that's sort of
occurring within nature already and then
to claim it is a hard thing to buy into</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
