key requirement in mobile web
development is optimizing for battery
usage battery life in your users mobile
device is an incredibly precious
resource so I want to call this out as
an explicit goal even though it's hard
to directly measure the best way to
optimize battery life is well to only do
work when you need to this may seem
pretty obvious but all the things that
we've talked about in this lesson are
applicable to this in fact network usage
computation and rendering are all heavy
indicators of battery usage but the
other AP is we'll talk about later can
also affect this for example using the
GPS changes battery usage as does the
camera one final comment there are
several tools out there that will
analyze your page for you and make some
suggestions about how to improve your
performance my personal favorite of
course is PageSpeed insights which is a
Google tool that you can point at any
website and it will give you feedback on
your performance with that and the tools
you've acquired in this lesson you're on
your way to designing performant web
apps in the problem set we're going to
be going over testing the conference app
with PageSpeed</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
