presenting off-the-shelf view
controllers you're probably wondering
how to present your own custom view
controllers here we have an app that
simulates rolling dice the first view
controller with the roll the dice button
presents a second view controller that
displays a roll of the dice the second
view controller can be presented in the
same way as the camera roll or the
activity views in alert views but this
time we have full control over the
displayed view controller the app is
currently incomplete in a second you'll
be asked to download it and look at the
Xcode project but before we get into the
Xcode files let's pause for a second to
draw the object diagrams for the two
view controllers that way we can clarify
which I be outlets and I be actions the
project should contain the first view
controller is simple it's just a single
button with a single action this is the
action that should trigger the
presentation of the dice view controller
the dice view controller is slightly
more complex it needs outlets to these
two image views that are for the dice it
also has one button with a single action
this action will cause the view
controller to be dismissed if you look
in the instructor notes you should see a
file called dice zip go ahead and
download that file and then examine the
dice Xcode project with the following
questions in mind check off each
question as you find the answers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
