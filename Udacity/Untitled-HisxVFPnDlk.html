that uses POSIX threads or P threads as
the library is also known we will
discuss POSIX threads for the remainder
of the lesson but most of the concepts
will apply to all thread libraries the
entry point for our process is main as
always and main will spawn two new
threads t1 and t2 which will enter at
the procedures f1 and f2 respectively
that's why we pass the function pointer
as we create these threads these
functions become like the main of our
other threads and as we see these
threads are going to print out a message
over and over that says that they are
the better thread notice that in Maine
we have this join method we'll discuss
this a little more later but basically
this means that the thread is going to
wait for thread one to finish before it
goes any further and the join with
thread 2 means that it will wait for
thread two to finish before going any
further</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
