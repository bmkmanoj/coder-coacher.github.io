create is a reflection of our
communication patent specifically he was
talking about software but we can take a
broader approach for a second so I those
are often simply communication models
there it's the way in which
decision-making and sort of ownership
around a particular set of problems gets
discussed and so one way that you can
start to break down the silo which is
the first step like if it's animosity
that's developed the first step is
bringing those people into into your
people right what you want is you want
to stop having the perspective that that
the silo is the thing I often tell
organizations to stop shipping their org
chart the very first thing that happens
typically as we as we see that we're
good at something is we want to double
down on that value and so and so we do
that by declaring you know this team
does X and so we start to start to align
and concentrate on the functional silo
we we put all the like things together
well let me let me let me try to address
the history for a second right I often
ask development teams and people doing
the develops transformation I asked them
this simple question does a DBA need to
database and then people look at me like
I'm like I have nine heads right but of
course a DBA doesn't need a database
dba's were created in some way by
software engineers who who didn't want
to deal with the with the underlying
complexity they needed a place to store
their data but they didn't want to have
to deal with with the runtime
consequences of bringing that database
in and so right off the bat in that
model a silo gets created through a
particular kind of conversation as a
software developer my value is solving
problems with code surely there must be
some other place some other functional
group that can be accountable
for the build aspects of my software
that can be responsible for the
infrastructure required to run it who
can manage it in production so we can
talk about all of these ways in which I
can maximize my personal value as a
software developer by not being
distracted by the consequences of the
choices I make I think that DevOps takes
a totally different approach it says
sure there are a number of skills that
need to need to be applied in order to
ensure that the software and serve and
technology that we that we build is
stable in production but it does not
that the approach that it takes is one
in which is an inclusive one that says
we are all sort of co responsible so
yeah bring it right if you're a database
expert bring that expertise into the
team but what I'm not going to do is I'm
not going to I'm not going to force you
into a box in which that's the only way
that you can express your creative
intelligence with relation to this
product that we're putting out in the
world as a matter of fact I don't want
that because you have had a broad
history and career you probably have
there's probably a lot of awesome that
you can bring in terms of understanding
in terms of understanding that product
in terms of understanding how it works
in the world so the approach that I
would take toward the animosity would be
first to heal it right like the first
thing you want to do is you want to meet
the people in the silo hey I'm I'm right
over here like my sort of a lot of
people have the open spaces now on my
desk is right over there I would
introduce yourself I would get to
understand how and why you were
separated by understanding what value
these people bring how they express that
value and then I would look for places
where you can combine to improve
something in the infrastructure I bring
that idea of sort of Kaizen to that's
sort of gradual change over time or team
improvement over time I would bring that
idea to your interactions so it's nice
to get to know people it's great to make
friends at work and I think that that's
the basis hi who are you this is who I
am what do you
you do this is what I do I think the
very next step is how can we work
together to make something that's better
than what we have today</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
