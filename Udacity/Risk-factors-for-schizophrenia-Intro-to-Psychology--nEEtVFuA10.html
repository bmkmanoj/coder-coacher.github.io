is related to someone who suffers from
schizophrenia the more likely that
person is also to suffer from the
disorder so we know from this that there
is a genetic component to schizophrenia
but by itself that's not enough there
also has to be some kind of stressful
environmental experience that the person
suffers from those two things together
are really what's required and we refer
to this as the diathesis stress model so
diathesis means the biological
predisposition and the stress means some
kind of environmental event it's those
two things together that are really
required and this by the way applies to
all kinds of psychological disorders
anxiety personality disorders
obsessive-compulsive disorders so let's
take a closer look at some of these
environmental risk factors for
schizophrenia so one of the risk factors
involved in the development of
schizophrenia is maternal infection and
so what we mean by this is that if the
pregnant woman is exposed to diseases or
infections that the baby later on in
life actually has an increased risk for
the development of schizophrenia so some
of these diseases and infections include
things like herpes influenza rubella and
toxoplasmosis and toxoplasmosis by the
way is found in feline feces which is
one reason why doctors always recommend
that pregnant women stay away from cat
litter other environmental risk factors
include chronic stress and taking
certain drugs now again by themselves
these things do not cause or even really
increase schizophrenia it's that coupled
with a genetic predisposition that's
really required and again this is what
we mean by the diathesis stress model</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
