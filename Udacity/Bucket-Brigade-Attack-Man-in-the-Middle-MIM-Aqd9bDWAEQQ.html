exchange is the so-called bucket brigade
attack it is a kind of man in the middle
attack that is Trudy the adversary can
intercept the message why a the Alice
sends to Bob and instead Trudy sends her
own YX to Bob and fooling Bob to accept
this as Y a likewise Trudy intercepts YB
that bubs sends to Alice and instead
sends her own YX to Alice fooling Alice
to believe that YX is actually YB and
the result is that the shear key there
Alice computes is actually the shear key
between Alice and Trudy and likewise the
shear key that Bob computes is actually
the shear key between 2d and Bob in
other words truly place Bob to Alice and
Alice to Bob this man in the middle
attack is possible because the
diffie-hellman key exchange protocol
does not authenticate Alice or Bob for
example there's no way for Alice to know
that the message that she receives is
really from Bob there are a number of
ways to fix this for example everyone
for example Alice and Bob can publish
her or his public key y año Y X that is
instead of having to send it and risk
interception and forgery that's
published yaa oyb and a public trusted
site or if alice has already published
her RS a public key she can sign why a
when she sent it to Bob so that but
would know that why a is really from
Alice because Bob can verify that using
Alice's RS a public key</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
