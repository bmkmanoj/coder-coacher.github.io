we can rearrange everything that we had
multiplied together in this term in
whatever order we want as long as we
keep every number we started with or
every factor that we started with and we
still just multiply those numbers
together so first I'm going to check and
make sure that every answer choice has a
10 and m23 and a 7 in it and it turns
out that this answer does it so I'll put
an X next to that we will not be cheeky
checking this box off we know that we're
only allowed to multiply these factors
together so any answer i see that has an
operator besides a multiplication sign
in it can't be right so here we have
some addition so the sensor isn't right
or this one or this one now there are
two tricky things in here there are
parentheses in this answer and in this
answer remember that another way to
indicate multiplication is just to write
factors next to one another all in
parentheses we can do this instead of
writing the dots for multiplication so
in fact checking these two answers that
have the parentheses in them knowing now
that parentheses mean multiplication we
see that they are both in fact correct
looking at our four remaining choices
all of these are also right answers in
fact there are number of other right
answers that I just didn't choose to
write down here any order that we could
write these four factors in as long as
we still multiply them together would
still be equal to this term</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
