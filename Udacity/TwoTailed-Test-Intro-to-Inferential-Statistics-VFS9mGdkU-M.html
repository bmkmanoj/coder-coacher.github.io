less than the Z critical value negative
1.96 at the Alpha level of 0 point 0 5
since it's in this critical region we
can say that it is unlikely to have
gotten a mean engagement score of 7
point 13 however this mean engagement
score does fall in the critical region
however there is evidence that my
singing made students less engaged
perhaps I should just stick to talking
when I teach a lesson and we can also
say that Amin engagement score of 7
point 13 is significant at probability
less than point 05 the probability of
getting an engagement score this far
from the mean in either direction is
less than point 05 that's basically what
that means when we do a two-tailed test
so let's say we got a sample mean that
is about here when we determine whether
or not this sample mean is significant
at point zero five we want to know if
the probability of obtaining a sample
mean this far from the mean of means is
less than point zero five and it doesn't
matter what direction so if we have this
z-score the probability of getting a
z-score that far below or above the mean
is the area here and here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
