will be that every row has the same
number of columns a column can be empty
or 0 we can't have two columns in some
rows and three columns in another row
that just doesn't make sense in a
relational database in fact that's
pretty much the same thing that's going
on when we had the food one food too and
food three columns if you have two
values with the same meaning for a given
key we're going to need to end up in
separate rows like this second rule some
one or more columns of the table are the
key which identify what thing each row
is telling us about like an animal a
species a bank account number a website
user in a simple table like majors it
may be that all the columns are part of
the key any other columns in the table
besides the key have to describe
something about the key in any row the
key provides the topic of the sentence
that the rest of the row says something
about Rule three in a normalized table
the non-key columns describe the key
they don't describe other non-key
columns so if you had a table of items
and how many there are and what location
they're in and the street address of
that location to normalize that you'd
want to split out the mapping from
location to address from the rest of the
table like so that way you can talk
about a location without talking about
any particular item it's not as if the
street address is specific to a
particular item after all lastly in a
normalized table the Rose don't imply
relationships among the data that don't
actually exist this is something to
watch out for especially when you have
multiple rows about the same entity and
multiple facts you want to record about
it suppose that you have some
information about some people's work
skills including the languages that they
know here anna belle knows databases and
linux and data science and english and
french and arabic and leon knows data
science and windows and english and
kurdish but databases don't have
anything particular to do with English
nor Linux with French but these rows
make it look like they do they make it
look like
Abele's Linux skill has something to do
with her French language ability and
that's almost certainly wrong so the
mapping from people to their technology
skills and the mapping of people to the
languages they know belong in separate
tables so there are four rules for
normalizing tables there's a lot more to
learn about this topic though I've put
some links in the instructor notes so
