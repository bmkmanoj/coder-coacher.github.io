write sentences in the language of logic
and also looked at how to rewrite these
sentences for example by eliminating
implication let us now look at what
kinds of rules of inference can be
applied and how can we apply them one
rule of inference is called modus ponens
and many of you may already be familiar
with it if I am given a sentence s1
which says P implies Q and another
sentence s2 which is P then I can infer
Q from it P implies Q and P therefore Q
this symbol stands for therefore let's
take an example so imagine that I am
given that feathers imply bird and I'm
also given that feathers is true then I
can infer that bird must be true now we
can connect this to a logic agent
imagine that there is a robot and I
bootstrap that robot with the knowledge
that feathers imply a bird now the robot
goes to a new region in the country and
find some animal which has feathers the
robot cannot conclude that that
particular animal is a bird so the first
sentence came from something that I had
bootstrapped into the knowledge of the
robot the second sentence came from the
percepts of the robot and it hurt
sentence came from its logical
inferencing and this is how the robot
can in fact go about making sound
complete inferences that have gotten
need to be correct here is a second rule
of inference this is called modus
tollens so again i have sentence s 1 P
implies Q and I have a second sentence
not Q and therefore i can inference that
not p so let us take an example of modus
tollens imagine that there is a robot
that has been programmed bootstrap with
the knowledge feathers imply bird so as
part of its knowledge base already this
robot goes to a new country and is
talking to the people in that country
and the people tell the robot a story
about an animal that is not a bird
therefore the robot may infer that that
animal must not have feathers
so this is coming from the knowledge
that is bootstrap this is coming from
the new perceptron this story and this
is coming from the logical inference and
once again the logical inferences
guaranteed to be sound and complete you
may already be familiar with this line
of reasoning because this is another way
of phrasing the contrapositive that we
see in other areas of logic</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
