where you can see information about how
people are using your app so here in the
overview page we see how many users how
many new users we've had in the past
month 400 not too bad active users 1200
so that's the new users and the previous
users we can see where in the world
people are using our app and we can see
what devices they're using to use the
app so we can drill down a little bit
more into some of these details so for
example where in the world we can like
really drill down we can see how many
people up we have 770 in New Zealand
right now 01 in Madagascar and then we
can get their actual data for it too so
we get the numbers and this app that
we're using here was developed by my
friend ian in lake and you've probably
seen him in the Android fundamentals to
course we can look into the language
that people are using in this case it's
predominantly English but we do have
Portuguese we do have some French users
so we can drill down more into the
devices that people are using so here we
see all the different devices and we can
see the percentage of the popularity of
the devices so the galaxy s5 was the
most popular recognized device some of
the unrecognized devices include the
emulator as well as devices that
analytics didn't recognize we can see
the top network operators we can even
see the screen resolutions that people
used the branding one of the really cool
things I can show you is the real time
data you can actually see how many
people are using your app right now and
actually I have to be honest it's not
really right now it's close to the right
now so it's close to real time you can
see the top locations where people are
using the app so somebody down here in
melbourn is actually using the app right
now we have people in Peru using it we
have people in the Philippines using it
we can see what they're looking at right
now and of course you know one of the
main things you do want to know about
your app
is what parts of the app are the users
using you get that through the screens
so this is not the real time data this
is overall the last month we can see all
the screens which screens the users went
to and a screen is equivalent to an
activity we see obviously that the main
screen is where people went the most and
then you can see you know where else
they went in the app you can also follow
through the flow of how people navigated
through the app so you can see where
they started where they went to next and
so on so I hope I've convinced you that
analytics can give you all kinds of
awesome information about how and where
your apps being used and now i'm going
to talk you through how you can update
your app so that you can get all this
awesome kind of information about how
your app is being used</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
