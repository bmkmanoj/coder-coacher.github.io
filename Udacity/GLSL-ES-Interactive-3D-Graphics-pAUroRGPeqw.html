shader program it runs this program is
passed to the GPU as a string of
characters I'll repeat that since it's a
bit unusual instead of sending compiled
code or binary data or some other
processed information to the driver you
actually send it its string of
characters WebGL shaders are written in
GL sles the OpenGL shading language for
embedded systems no one calls it GL sles
everyone simply says GoSL if you use
DirectX you'd use hlsl their high level
shading language in either case the
character string is what gets sent to
the graphics driver the graphics driver
compiles these into assembly
instructions that are sent to the GPU
here's how to create a shader string in
JavaScript the first line is how
JavaScript says it's going to define an
array what we're doing here is defining
a string for each line of our program
that's one way to get shader programs
into 3gs but it's usually not the most
convenient there are all these quote
marks and commas which are visually
confusing in a pain to add and maintain
that said one advantage of this approach
is that you can glue together strings on
the fly to make shaders this is in fact
exactly what 3gs does when you ask for
three lights and a shiny material it
creates a custom shader for exactly
those elements if you have a specific
fixed shader in mind and easier ways to
make your program a separate text
resource I won't work through the
mechanics here this isn't really a web
programming class but see the code in
this course is github repository for how
we do it basically you create a separate
text file or script element that has
your programs text in it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
