available to make closure expressions
super concise in fact this is one of the
coolest aspects of closure expressions
and swift and at times one of the most
confounding I want to walk you through
some of these tricks using the filter
method from the array class the filter
method is called by an instance of the
array class it takes in a condition as
an argument and returns an array that's
been filtered based on that condition
the condition is passed in as a closure
here I have an array of exam grades and
I'm gonna filter this array for all the
grades above 70 we'll call those grades
passing grades so I call the filter
method with the object exam grades and I
pass in a closure representing the
filter condition the closure takes in a
grade an int and returns a bool
representing whether the condition is
true at this point this looks a lot like
the syntax we saw for sort here's the
first trick the compiler can infer
closure expression types based on what
parameter type a given function expects
in this case the compiler can infer that
the closure expression for filter will
take in a parameter that matches the
type of the array being filtered the
compiler can also infer that this
closure will return a bool so here we
can leave out the word int and we can
leave out the word bool and over here in
the sidebar you can see that we still
get the same result
onto the next check if a closure is a
single expression like this one it can
be inferred that the result of that
expression should be returned so we can
remove the word return and again over
here in the sidebar you can see that our
filter still works and now for the trick
that's been known to make some code
readers headspin shorthand argument
names swift provides default argument
names for closure expressions so instead
of specifying a first argument the first
argument is known as dollar signs
0 the second argument is known as dollar
sign 1 and so on so here for example we
don't have to give this argument a name
we don't have to use the name grade we
can just use the default name for the
first argument dollar sign 0 and since
we're not giving great a name anymore we
can omit it here as well along with the
word in
let's see all those shortcuts one more
time we'll go back to the alphabetical
soup example from your quiz the closure
expression parameter and return types
can be inferred so we can take out
string string and bool along with the
arrow of course this is a single
expression closure so it can be inferred
that it returns the result of the single
expression so we can leave out return
and we can use shorthand argument names
for soup 1 and soup 2 and we're left
with a statement that truly is amazingly
concise</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
