primarily on what's called the
electrostatic force which is the force
that makes different charges come
together and like charges go apart from
each other and you may be wondering
yourself how does this electrostatic
force compared to our old favorite force
gravity in this problem we're going to
work out which of those two forces the
electrostatic force which I've called Fe
here and the force of gravity which I'm
calling FG here reigns supreme so let's
imagine that we have two positively
charged particles here and each one of
these charges has a positive charge of
one Coulomb let's also assume that their
masses are the same value so we know
from this unit that because both of
these particles have positive charges
the electric force will push them apart
from each other but because both of
these particles have nonzero mass
gravity will try and pull them back
together so for this problem your goal
is to figure out what the mass of these
two particles has to be such that the
gravitational force and the electric
force are perfectly balanced out so that
these particles when released will not
move they'll just stand at their current
positions now in order for you to figure
this out I'm going to have to give you a
little bit of extra information in
problem set 4 we learned Newton's law
for universal gravitation that the force
of gravity is equal to this constant G
times the mass of the two particles
divided by the distance between them
squared and it turns out that for
charged particles we have almost an
identical law this equation here which
we call Coulomb's law says that the
electric force between two charged
particles is equal to some constant K
times the charge of both of those
particles divided by the distance
between them squared now I didn't
include any information about which
direction this force is going in here
but you can figure out what the
direction of the force is going to be
just Bible comparing the charges of the
two particles if they're both the same
they'll push away from each other and if
they're both different then they'll pull
towards each other now I hope you find
it as awesome as I do that these
equations for the gravitational force an
electrostatic force ended up being
almost exactly the same this seems to
indicate that there's something
fundamental about physics underlying
both of these two equations and i
encourage you to discuss this idea more
on the forms alright so now that you
know the equations for both of the
forces were concerned about in this
problem you're ready to try and balance
them out alright so given these two
values of K and G
can you tell me what the mass of these
two particles have to be such that the
forces balance each other out perfectly
put your answer here and use scientific
notation so put the decimal part up here
and the exponent over here good luck</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
