finding a bug sounds pretty
straightforward and we've done this
before but this time we're mixing it up
a bit and not giving you access to the
source code we didn't really give you
too much guidance on how to do this but
believe it or not this is actually a
pretty common thing you're going to have
to do in the real world having access to
the source code or the implementation
itself is often more rare than it is
common plus sometimes even with the
source code it can be so unfamiliar or
poorly documented that it's might as
well be not having it at all with that
said let's look at the problem so here
we have the code to test the problems
and below we have the given test case
now we told you somewhere in here lies
the buck one way to narrow it down was
to look at each of these hypotheses and
then test them one by one I'm going to
show you a quick test case that gets
right to the bug here I've inserted the
code from homework 6 debugging
environments and when I run that code I
see the same bug that we saw in homework
6 this implies and you can further
verify on your own the problem is right
here where we're not passing in the
right function environment when we're
executing function so bug equals 7 is
the answer just in case you're curious
here's the source code for the
expression evaluation if we look at call
will see that the environment that we
call the function on is the same
environment from which it's called and
not from which the function was defined</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
