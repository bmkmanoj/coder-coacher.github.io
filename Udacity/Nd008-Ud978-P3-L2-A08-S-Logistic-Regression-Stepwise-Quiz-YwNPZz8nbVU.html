my model to determine those two answers
we've already built out how to connect
to the hotel loyalty data using a select
tool and the crate samples tool but let
me build out the logistic regression the
stepwise tool and then show you how I
interpreted the results the first thing
I'm going to do is bring out the
logistic regression yet again and we'll
call this whatever we really want to but
i'll call it quiz logistic i'm now going
to select my target field in the
redeemer field and then choose all my
different possible predictor variables
not including the customer key first
name last name and redeemer fields after
this instead of bring out a browse after
the logistic regression i'm going to
pump this rate into the stepwise tool
i'm going to name this model quiz
underscore stepwise then i'm going to
keep both the search direction and
adjusted fit measure by defaults and
lastly let me go out and browse these
results and run the workflow now looking
at these results we can answer to the
two different questions I asked you in
the quiz the first one is which
variables that we actually removed from
our logistic regression model and as you
can see the customer segments field
income years of loyalty and income you
were all removed from our logistic
regression model by your stepwise tool
and as you can see our r-squared value
is 0.6 096 so that's how I looked at the
different results from our stepwise
regression tool</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
