sequential program how can we exploit
the cluster we have multiple processors
how do we exploit the cluster is the
starting point of the sequential program
one possibility is to do what is called
automatic parallelization that is
instead of writing an explicitly
parallel program we write a sequential
program and let somebody else do the
heavy lifting in terms of identifying
opportunities for parallelism that
exists in the program and map it to the
underlying cluster and this is what is
called an implicitly parallel program
the opportunities for parallelism but
the program itself is not written as a
parallel program and now it is the
owners of the tool in this case an
automatic parallelizing compiler to look
at the sequential program and identify
opportunities for parallelism and
exploit that by using the resources that
are available in the cluster so
high-performance fortran is an example
of a programming language that does
automatic parallelization but it is user
assisted parallelization in the sense
that the user who is writing the
sequential program is using directives
for distribution of data and computation
and those directives are then used by
this parallelizing compiler to say oh
these are opportunities for mapping
these computations on to the resources
of a cluster so it puts it on different
nodes of the cluster and that way it
exploits the parallelism that is there
in the hardware starting from the
sequential program and doing the heavy
lifting in terms of converting the
sequential program to a parallel program
to extract performance for this
application this kind of automatic
parallelization or implicitly parallel
programming works really well for
certain classes of program called data
parallel programs in such programs for
the most part the data accesses are
fairly static and it is determinable at
compile time so in other words there is
limited potential for exploiting the
available peril
ilysm in the cluster if we resort to
implicitly parallel programming</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
