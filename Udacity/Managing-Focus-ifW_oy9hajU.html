shouldn't add tabindex to site content
as a general rule but there is one
exception to this and that's when you're
manipulating the page in response to a
user action a scenario might be that a
user goes and clicks on one of these
menu items and the page then does an
animated scroll down to that particular
section or if you are building a single
page web app clicking on one of the
navigation links changes the content of
the page without doing a full page
refresh in either of these situations
you'll want to pick an appropriate
header give it a tab index of negative 1
so it doesn't appear in the natural tab
order and call its focus method after
the user has taken their action this
process is known as managing focus and
it's an extremely important technique
that keeps the users interactive context
in sync with the visual representation
of the site let's go through that single
page app scenario i just discussed and
i'll highlight what happens when we
don't manage focus and then demonstrate
how the experience can be improved when
we do manage focus so here we are back
at our site i'm going to go click on
this what is Vegemite link and when I do
that I'm going to want to start clicking
around some of the anchors in the main
page content so using my keyboard I'll
navigate over there I'll press Enter and
now I'd like to click this link but in
order to get there I'm gonna have to tab
back through my navigation now there's
only a few navigation items here so it's
not the you know biggest deal in the
whole world we could imagine on a
complex site with a lot of navigation
going on in the header that could be a
lot of work to get through all of that
furthermore as a screen reader user I
might not even know that the page
content has loaded in and changed yet I
might just be sort of sitting around
waiting for something to happen after
I've clicked that link let's see if we
can improve upon this a little bit so
what I do is take this heading right
here I'm going to give it a tab index of
negative 1 if you recall that means the
element won't be in the tab order but I
can programmatically focus it using
javascript now I can listen for my
anchor clicks I can tell the page
content to update and lastly I can call
the focus method of that header once
I've done that the user will then be
moved down in here inside of our main
page content and it can then quickly tab
or shift tab to whatever they want so
let's run through that I'm going to go
over to the recipes
section hit enter you'll see the header
is focused and I'm very quickly jump
down into these additional anchor links
now you might notice that as we do this
the header itself gets a large focus
ring placed around it I'm going to talk
more about styling focus in a future
lesson but if you'd like you can click
the link down in the instructor notes to
jump ahead and learn how to work around
