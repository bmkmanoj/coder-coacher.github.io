a common question that is raised is
whether or not an online program can
actually be comparable to an in-person
program because there's no difference
between the online and on-campus
diplomas we go to great lengths to
ensure their equality most classes in
the program are developed by the same
instructors that teach the classes on
campus these are often professors that
are world-famous in their fields and
they're taking time to develop these
courses separate from their usual
teaching responsibilities many of our
courses use the exact same assessments
and graders as the on campus courses we
know that courses are comparable because
both groups of students are being
evaluated on the same assignments by the
same individuals we use state-of-the-art
technology to ensure the integrity of
the program we know that you're here
because a degree from Georgia Tech
really means something and we want to
keep it that way we use cutting-edge
tools to evaluate submissions for
plagiarism to detect cheating during
exams and to ensure the identities of
participants every semester we're able
to detect and remove people engaging in
unfair copying of code or written work
so you press assured that everyone
receiving at Georgia Tech master's
degree whether online or on campus has
truly earned it in every way we're
working hard to make sure a degree from
Georgia Tech is a valuable credential
regardless of whether it's earned online
or on campus</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
