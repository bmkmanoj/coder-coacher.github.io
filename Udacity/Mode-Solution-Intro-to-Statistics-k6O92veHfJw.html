elegant but it's the simplest that I
could find without going into more
complicated data structures the key
thing is that I'm gonna go through all
my data items there's a for loop over
here as I explained before this gives me
the length of the data sequence this
gives me a list of all the indices from
0 to 6 in this case and then gonna go
with these indices one after another in
this variable I and now comes the tricky
part
I picked the I've data item in a count
how often does this occur in the entire
list so therefore the first data item 1
the argument here will be 1 and the
count will give me 1 because there's
only exactly one occurrence of 1 but for
the third item as we know I will be to
now the in Athens Iran then this thing
over here will give me the number 5 and
when I hit count I get back 3 because
there's three occurrences of 5 now I
need to find the maximum count and
specifically the data item that
maximizes the count for that I've
implemented a very called mode count
that are set to 0 and if my current
count exceeds mode count and I've found
a new winner so as a new winner I'm
gonna set the new data item to the
winner of the mode and I update mode
count to reflect the fact that this new
winner has a higher count and later said
than my initial 0 I iterate this out
comes the mode and when I run it for
this data set I get 5 if you got this
right then you know a lot about
programming this was really a
non-trivial programming quest</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
