talking about the problem or need as
part of the product and I just want you
to remember it's kind of interesting to
differentiate between solving a problem
G somebody has an accounting problem or
a word processor or you know they can
now use Google Docs versus Microsoft
Word versus a need what's a need well a
need might be neat to be entertained a
need to communicate needs are something
that are universal across all seven
billion people on the planet your total
available market plus or minus a couple
billion maybe kids zero to five don't
have those needs but eventually you will
find market sizes for needs to be
multiples by orders of magnitude above
solving problems and so I'm not
suggesting that you don't solve problems
I'm not suggesting that you try to turn
every problem into a need but let me
suggest the one company in the 21st
century that did this better than
anybody else on the planet was Apple and
the iPhone they took a communications
device and made it a status symbol and
they transitioned from a product that
solved a problem integrated web browser
email and phone into something that
people now every year
obsolete their own products by wanting
to get the next one because it's now a
need rather than a product</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
