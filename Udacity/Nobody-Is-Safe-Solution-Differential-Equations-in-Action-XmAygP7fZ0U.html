problem of unit three we started by
adding in a constraint to the system
with this line right here about n this
shows as I explained earlier that the
total population n remains constant at
all times with people just switching
between the s and I groups now let's
move on to the core of the problem
switching the contents with a for loop
to use the trapezoidal rule instead of
the forward Euler method we begin with
the standard expressions for esta and I
dot but this time showing that people
can move from the infected population
back to the susceptible population
directly just for simplicity i'm going
to call our constants a and B right now
and I'll change them later to show
what's actually in the code now we can
get a single equation that encapsulate
the information in all three of these
equations if we just substitute n minus
I 4s in the equation for i dot this is
what this line right here shows if we do
a little bit of rearranging and
simplifying we get a quadratic equation
for i dot now this makes things a lot
simpler all together because now we have
one equation and one independent
variable instead of three equations and
two independent variables now it's time
to move on and use the trapezoidal rule
you'll notice here that i'm using a tea
in the subscripts instead of an n this
time that's just so that we don't get
confused between big ends and little
ends so we know that for the t plus one
time step I is going to equal this
expression just in the trapezoidal rule
however we just to create an equation
for i dot that depends only on I so we
can plug that expression in to get this
expanded equation right here since many
of the terms in this expression have
factors of H over 2 and a outside of
them I'm just going to pull out a factor
of H a over 2 with a little bit of
rearranging we come up with this long
expression and we can think of this
equation is made up of two parts one
part that involves I sub T plus one
another part that just involves eyes of
tea since we want to think of I T plus 1
as the only independent variable we can
lump everything else under other
variable names looking at the equation
we have one term with I sub T plus 1
squared a couple of terms with I t plus
one to the first power in several terms
that don't have I t plus 1 at all and
we're going to call everything that's in
front of I t plus 1 to the first power P
and we're going to call every
that doesn't involve it at all q and
this is going to give us the simplified
quadratic expression that shows very
clearly how this is a quadratic equation
using I so T plus 1 using the quadratic
formula and rearranging a little bit we
get this expression right here using P
and Q to express I sub T plus 1 now this
actually has two possible solutions one
with a plus sign here and one with a
minus sign here so how do we decide
which one to pick well we know that as H
the time step goes to 0 we want I sub T
plus 1 and I sub T to get closer and
closer together since the curve is going
to become smoother and smoother since P
has a term of 1 over H inside of it this
means that P is going to go to infinity
as this happens now if we put the minus
sign over here they're going to have
minus infinity which means that I sub T
plus 1 is definitely going to go to
negative infinity and this is definitely
not what we want so just to be safe we
will pick the plus sign here now I
return to the code where we've
translated our expressions for P and Q
into Python to do this we have to
remember that the coefficients a and B
that we're using Lear writing things by
hand actually each have different names
in the code a is equal to the
transmission coefficient and b is equal
to 1 over the infectious time using this
information we've just done a simple
translation of P and Q into Python this
makes writing out the expressions for I
step plus 1 and s step was one very easy
four eyes two plus one we just write in
the solution that we got from using the
quadratic formula using of course the
plus sign right here in the variables P
and Q since they're just written right
here anyway because we know that I plus
s is always equal to n our expression
for s is simply equal to n minus I at
that time step now let's run this first
with step size point five and see what
happens this looks very nice we have to
really smooth curves with the infectious
population is green and the susceptible
population is blue just like in the last
problem we see that since each curve in
the plot approaches a constant value at
long times we are approaching a steady
state situation now let's run the
program instead with step size 10 so
this is what we get from our model if
we're using H equals 10
instead of H equals 0 point 5 even
though night of our curve is
particularly smooth we can see that they
obey the same overall pattern as we saw
under graph using the smaller step size
the most important thing is that we
still are approaching a steady state
situation at the end of the graph now
think back to what happened when you ran
the supplied code like we asked you to
when you ran the supplied code with H
equals 2.5 you should have gotten a
graph it looks like this this definitely
looks a lot like what we saw we ran the
solution code using H equals 0 point 5
as well however let's peek at what
happened when you used H equals 10 using
the forward Euler method we can see that
there are a lot of differences between
this and the graph that we just saw and
also between this and the graph of the
solution code when we add H equals 10
the most important thing to notice
though is what's happening over here in
this region we can see that instead of
each curve approaching one set value as
time goes on they keep crossing paths
with each other in other words since I
and s here don't obey nearly the same
trend that they do with smaller step
sizes this shows the forward Euler
method doesn't allow for stability with
large step sizes nearly as well as
implicit methods like the trapezoidal
method do hope that was an interesting
investigation into the difference
between implicit methods and other kinds
of methods and get ready for the last
problem of unit 3</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
