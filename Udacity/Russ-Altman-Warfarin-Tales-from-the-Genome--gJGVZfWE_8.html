popular hits of things that people are
interested in are the warfarin patties
now why is that so warfarin is pretty
much the most advanced case of
pharmacogenetics that has been studied
well why do I say that warfarin has more
than one drug that impacts its response
and we actually know what a lot of those
more than one GM sorry morphin has more
than one gene that's important for
understanding its response and we
actually know what a lot of those genes
are and how to combine the information
from more than one gene that's that's a
frontier if there are many g drugs for
which we know there are several genes
but we don't know how to combine the
information yet we do for warfarin
that's the first thing the second thing
about warfarin is that we also know some
of the environmental variables that
affect warfarin response how much green
leafy vegetables you're eating what your
height and weight is what other drugs
you're on that all combines to have
warfarin be the single best drug that we
have for predicting response based on
the combination of genetics and
environmental factors the other thing
that I should have actually mentioned
right off the bat is there are something
between 30 and 50 million Americans
alone on this drug and probably
obviously twice that or more
internationally so we're talking about a
hundred million people on this drug
there are new drugs coming out that are
hoping to knock it off as the leader but
today warfarin is still an incredibly
important drug worldwide and so accurate
dosing especially for a dangerous drug
like warfarin as you may know warfarin
is a anticoagulant and it makes it
harder to clot your blood that's good if
you've had a heart attack it's good if
you've had a stroke it's good if you've
had a clot in your lung or in your legs
but if you have too much of it it can
kill you with internal spontaneous
hemorrhage so there's this very narrow
range we have to get it right and that's
where the genetics can help all right it
sounds like blood clotting is obviously
important when we cut ourselves and
we're bleeding but you know if it's
blocking our hearts that's not so good
well you mentioned that there are so
many people on warfarin the variation in
the human genome that exists
the farm gkb site for example does it
sort of separate is it able to document
the pharmacokinetic in the
pharmacodynamic pathway separately does
it combine them how do you how do you
present that informations good for you
for knowing about this and good for your
class in the case of warfarin there are
both pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic
pharmacokinetics I'd that changed the
rate at which it's metabolized and one
of the most important genes it's called
cyp2c9 there's another one called a cyp
for f2 but to see nine to take as an
example it's well known that if you're
going to metabolize warfarin more slowly
you're going to need less of it and and
if you take the normal dose when you're
a slow metabolizer you're going to wind
up with effectively an overdose and too
much bleeding there on the
pharmacodynamic side there's a gene
again with a terrible name it's called
vkorc1 or vitamin K oxido reductase
component one which is actually the
target it's that it's the protein which
the drug warfarin binds to to inhibit
clotting and there are some variations
both inside this gene but also in the
control regions of the gene that control
its expression that markedly change its
levels and there are some variations
that are very important for determining
warfarin dose in that so it's a great
story because there's this one pd gene
that seems dominant this one PK gene
that seems dominant together you can
come darn close to predicting what the
right dose will be for individual
patients even without needing to see
them clinically first that's right you
it does you do best if you have their
age because there are some age effects
and gender there's some sex effects of
the genetics and then ethnicity you
would hope that ethnicity would drop out
because you would hope that once we have
the genetic measurements who cares what
your ancestry is but I must say that our
ability to predict those for African
descent people is still not as good and
so in our lab we're working very hard
the hypothesis would be that there are
additional genetic variations seen in
that population that have not been
studied yet that with knowledge of those
will be able to get our level of
prediction for
african descent people to be as good as
where we are now for European and Asian
descent thank you so much for shouting
with it's my pleasure thanks for doing
that yeah of course</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
