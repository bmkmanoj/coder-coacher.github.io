reflection I want you to go out and find
an example where you got stuck crossing
either the Gulf of execution or the Gulf
of evaluation and you can share your
example via whatever format you'd like
so photos video text as long as your
example clearly communicates where you
got stuck and why so here's a tip while
you're going out in the world and
looking for difficult situations look
for a place where somebody has applied
maybe a handmade label that gives
additional instructions on how to do
something
this is often a user's call for help
this wasn't designed right I need extra
help so maybe there's a post-it note on
something that gives some additional
explanation it might also be an official
sign so here's a few examples one
well this door is an emergency exit but
it actually isn't clear that it's an
emergency exit so somebody had to hand
make a sign that said don't go out this
door or the alarm will sound well then
people might actually be confused
because if there was an emergency
they wouldn't know where they can go out
that door or not and look at this coffee
maker well for some reason and maybe
it's a cultural constraint here is that
red means on No
sorry I got that wrong red actually
means off boy that's confusing so they
added a handmade label here that said
the red light when it's on means the
coffee machine is off</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
