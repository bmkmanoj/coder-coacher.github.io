writing a program that checks Sudoku
grids to make sure that they are
balanced over grids and if you haven't
played sodoku before we'll go over
briefly or you can go check the
Wikipedia page which probably has a far
more in-depth explanation than we could
ever give here so stup Sudoku is a game
played by on a 9 by 9 grid which will be
representing as a list of lists that
contains 81 elements and each one of
these 81 elements has to be a number
between 0 &amp;amp; 9 including 0 &amp;amp; 9 and if
either of these doesn't hold then we'll
be returning none right away before we
do anything else and if we do pass those
sanity checks then we're going to return
true if all of these hold which are the
basic checks that go on in a Sudoku game
each number 1 through 9 occurs only once
in each row it also occurs only once in
each column and in each 3x3 sub grid on
the box on the board I mean and it also
occurs only once in each 3x3 sub grid in
the overall grid and that might be clear
with a bit of a picture so here you can
see all 9 3x3 sub grids and each of
these should only have the number 1
through 9 once for each sub grid now you
can have 0 in a valid sub grid that
means that it hasn't been encoded yet we
don't have any solution for instance
that has those numbers in it so your
program will have to account for that
now give you a few examples of what we
expect first we get an ill formed board
where you see that this row doesn't have
9 elements it only has 8 we should
return none immediately this is a valid
board with no zeros and it should have
returned true this is an invalid board
that should return false because it has
the elements 1 through 9 either in a
more than once in a row a column or
3x3 sub-grid so I'll leave you to check
that is indeed the case for this one
then we have two that aren't finished
one that's fairly easy Sudoku puzzle if
you're going to solve it by hand and one
that is actually quite difficult to
solve by hand at least for me and both
of these should return true you can
solve both of these and with valid
Sudoku answers you're going to write
this in the check pseudo goo function
and we give you these print statements
to check them now these are the only one
the only test cases we're going to be
testing against for this problem set
that's not really the point of this
assignment though what I'd like you to
do is go to the forums and post the code
that you used to solve this in the
forums and we'll have a link to a
specific forum post in the instructor
comments down below the video so please
check that and I'd also like you to look
at other people's code and see if you
can think of some buzzers that would
break these people's code either a
specific instance of someone's code or
if you have a general-purpose fuzzer
that would run well against general
Sudoku checkers then go ahead and post
that in the forums I'd really like you
to think about what kind of inputs and
what kind of testing you would have to
do in order to do this well so I hope
you have fun with this I hope there's a
lot of great discussion on the forum
about it and I look forward to seeing
all of your solutions okay great
have fun</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
