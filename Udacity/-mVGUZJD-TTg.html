developed is that it is highly
generalizable it does not depend on
working only in three dimensions in fact
just by changing the word plane in our
algorithm to the word line we can
immediately use the code to solve
systems of equations in two dimensions
on the other hand this algorithm will
allow us to work with higher dimensional
systems of equations to recall that a
two-dimensional plane in three
dimensions is defined by a single linear
equation in three variables if we move
to n dimensions a similar notion is
called a hyperplane which is defined by
a single linear equation with n
variables the geometry of higher
dimensional objects even though we can't
visualize them in three-dimensional
space is analogous to the geometry we've
studied so far as with lines and planes
a hyperplane in n dimensions is an N
minus 1 dimensional object and it can be
specified by a normal vector and a base
point also like lines and planes the
coefficients of the variables in the
equation give a normal vector for the
higher dimensional hyper plane and we
need at least n different hyper planes
and n dimensions in order to obtain a
unique intersection point most
importantly gaussian elimination works
just as well on systems of equations in
more than three variables as it does
with just two and three variables
similar to the line and plane classes we
created let's now create a hyperplane
class to make it I almost literally copy
and paste my code for the plane object
just replacing all instances of the word
plane with hyper plane the only other
change I need to make is in the
initializer function here since the
hyperplane could live in an arbitrary
dimension I'm adding an optional
parameter dimension to the list of
arguments if both the dimension and the
normal vector are missing in the
initializer call then I can't figure out
which dimension is being asked for so I
raise an exception otherwise I either
set the normal vector to be all zeros in
the given dimension or I set the
dimension to be the dimension of the
normal vector given and that's pretty
much it going back to the linear system
class after importing the hyperplane
class from my hyper plane
and without changing any of the code in
my linear system class I can now build
linear system out of hyper planes and as
long as the dimensions of each hyper
plane and a system are the same it will
work as expected here I have a system of
lines here I have a system of planes and
here I have a system of four dimensional
hyper planes in five dimensional space
and running the code I obtain
parameterizations of the solutions for
each of the systems or I'm told that the
system doesn't have a solution</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
