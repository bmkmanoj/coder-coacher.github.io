security here's an overview of the
architecture of Android which is based
on linux android is implemented in the
form of a software stack architecture
consisting of a linux kernel a runtime
environment and corresponding libraries
an application framework and a set of
applications at the lowest level is the
linux kernel it provides a level of
abstraction between device hardware and
upper layers of the android software
stack each application running on the
android device runs his own instance of
the dalvik virtual machine absa commonly
written in java and compelled to buy
code of the Java Virtual Machine which
is then translated to dalvik bytecode
the dalvik excludable format is very
compact and it is designed for systems
such as smartphones that are constrained
in terms of memory and processor speed
by using dalvik enjoy can achieve
performance and efficiency the Android
core libraries are java based ivories
for application development for example
for web browsing data access and
database queries graphics rendering and
so on the Android core libraries do not
actually perform much of the actual work
and are in fact essentially Java
wrappers around the set of C and C++
based libraries these C and C++
libraries are included to fulfill a wide
range of functions including 2d and 3d
graphics rendering secure socket layer
etc the application framework is a set
of services that collectively form the
environment for Android apps to run the
application framework allows apps to be
constructed using reusable
interchangeable and replaceable
components furthermore an app can
publish its capabilities along with any
corresponding data so that they can be
found and used by other apps at the top
of
android software stack are the apps
these include apps that come with the
device such as homes contacts and phone
and browsers and other third-party apps
that the user had downloaded after he
purchases the device</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
