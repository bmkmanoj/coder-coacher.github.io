security he is an overview of the
architecture of Android which is based
on Linux Android is implemented in the
form of a software stack architecture
consisting of a Linux kernel a runtime
environment and corresponding libraries
an application framework and a set of
applications at the lowest level is the
Linux kernel it provides a level of
abstraction between device hardware and
upper layers of the Android software
stack each application running on the
Android device runs his own instance of
the dalvik virtual machine after
commonly written in Java in compiled to
bytecode of the Java Virtual Machine
which is then translated to Dalek
bytecode the dalvik is cutable format is
very compact and it is designed for
systems such as smartphones they are
constrained in terms of memory and
processor speed by using dalvik Android
can achieve performance and efficiency
the Android core libraries are Java
based ivories for application
development for example for web browsing
data access and database queries
graphics rendering and so on the Android
code libraries do not actually perform
much of the actual work and are in fact
essentially Java wrappers around the set
of C and C++ based libraries these C and
C++ libraries are included to fulfill a
wide range of functions including 2d and
3d graphics rendering secure socket
layer etc the application framework is a
set of services that collectively from
the environment for Android apps to run
the application framework allows apps to
be constructed using reusable
interchangeable and replaceable
components furthermore an app can
publish its capabilities along with any
corresponding data so that they can be
found and reused by other apps
at the top of the Android software stack
are the apps these include apps that
come with a device such as homes
contacts and phone and browser and other
third-party apps that the user have
downloaded after he purchases the device</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
