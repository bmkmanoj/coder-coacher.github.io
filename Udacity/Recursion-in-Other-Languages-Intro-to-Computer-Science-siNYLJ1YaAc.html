thought recursive calls were more
efficient than iterative functions
professor Evans said that recursive
definition isn't very efficient in
Python so I want to ask give other
programming languages like C or Java
improve the recursive calls in order to
always be more efficient than the
iterative method thanks for the question
man well the problem with recursion in
terms of performance is that when you
execute a procedure that does a
recursive call you've got to keep track
of the state of that call that's called
a stack frame you're keeping track of
the function you called you're keeping
track of where to return when you're
done and you're making a new space to
store the parameters that you pass in to
that procedure so if you have a
recursive call each time you're doing
the recursive call you need a new stack
frame to keep track of that when you
finally get to the base case well then
you've got a result and you've got to
unwind all that so you're going back
through all those stack frames passing
back the results reclaiming that space
so that takes a lot of space if there's
a lot of recursive calls like some of
the examples you've seen in 101 you're
going to run out of space when you do
that on a high input for some languages
there's an optimization that the
interpreter or the compiler does to know
that if the only thing that you do with
the results of the recursive call is
pass it back to the next level well you
don't really need to keep track of all
those stacks you can keep your using the
one you had just replacing the
parameters and knowing that when you're
done that's the actual result or maybe
you do a more complex optimization where
there's something you need to do on a
result but you don't need to keep track
of all those stack frames so this is
what most languages that are designed to
use recursion frequently do languages
like Lisp and scheme are designed this
way to make it very efficient to do
recursive calls it's still more
expensive than iteration because you
still need to do the call you need to do
the mechanics of calling a procedure and
getting a result but with this tail
recursion optimization you don't need to
keep track of all those stack frames so
it's much more efficient than it is in
Python there have been a lot of
questions about why am i covering
recursive procedures if there's
Oh efficient in Python and the reason
for doing that is really it's a very
useful way of thinking even if you need
to eventually turn the procedure into an
iterative version of it by writing the
recursive version and understanding how
the recursive definition works and
understanding things that way you're
thinking in a new and powerful way
recursive procedures are often easier to
reason about then iterative ones and if
you use a language that does provide
tail recursion elimination well then the
recursive definition is often the one
that you want to use in Python that's
usually not the case that it's better to
write a procedure not to have a
recursive call because you're going to
run out of stack space if you ever call
it on a large input</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
