debugging and logging and how to make
the development process a little bit
smoother and any advice you had about
that okay yeah that's a good question
okay so testing and debugging let's
start with the bugging first because
this one I actually do know how to do
first thing you want to do is is in your
file you can say import logging and this
is the python standard logging library
and it's already configured so
throughout your code you can basically
say logging the bug and just give this a
string and it'll print that in the
console whenever this line is run if
you're in debug mode now there's another
command there's another series of lines
that I'm not going to write here but if
you look at the homework example I put
up basically at the top of every of all
of my source files I have this line
that's basically the bug and capitals
and basically what it does is it looks
at the environment to see if I'm running
an app engine debug mode or in
production and so in production this
would be false and in in development
this value would be true and this this
basically triggers all of these
statements so in production we don't log
all of these two bug statements but in
development we log you know everything
that gets called by dot the bug gets
printed to the console now you can also
say dot error logging error and this
will print in production and in
development and so this is really handy
if there's if there's a case where
something went wrong you know the
database didn't load right or you know
some user error happen that you want to
be aware of even if it's happening in
production you can call logging that
error and then can go into the admin
console which in App Engine you go to
you know a pin or App Engine calm and
you can view you see all your admin
stuff you can actually look at all of
your locks and it'll include everything
from error but it won't include the
stuff from debug so that's a really
helpful you know kind of way of seeing
what's going on in your program of
course there's always print you know is
really helpful as well now using things
like the actual Python the bugger is
really hard with web apps because you're
not running this module there's this
whole framework around
so there are more complicated setups but
I found you know over the years that
just having really good output to your
console can go a long way now for how to
test testing is really really hard on
web apps there's a whole Udacity course
on how to do testing and a lot of your
modules a lot of the stuff that i would
put in a utils file like the hashing and
the cookies and salting and all that
stuff you can just write functions to
test that you know there's a whole
course now for actually testing the
behavior of your web app that's a lot
harder you know what we used to do at
reddit is we would deploy you know our
code on one server and we'd have an
error lock that was constantly scrolling
in real time of all of our errors across
all the app servers and if that starts
scrolling faster we know there was a bug
we just pushed into production and we
take that machine out of rotation and
investigate and that's you know I would
say not the most professional way of
doing things however I have a good
authority that many of the largest
websites in the world actually do things
that way because testing websites is
fairly non-deterministic you just don't
know what the errors are going to be
it's very hard to know what the errors
are going to be another strategy we use
done read it a lot is we would take
before doing a big deployment we would
capture you know the last 10,000
requests or so and we would store those
and we'd replay them against our new app
servers or in development we just run
all of those requests against the
development app server and if that
produced an error then we'd go
investigate that works really well
because we figure if the error is
serious we're going to see it
immediately and if it's not something we
see immediately it's probably not
serious and that's that's basically how
we've done our testing you know and
every once a while something bad sneaks
through unfortunately we've never lost
that are really corrupted any data
because we we try to do the best we can
locally but it's still a real challenge
in every websites a little different so
something you need to think pretty hard
about you know what can go wrong and
what happens if this piece of data is
null or is full of malicious text as
long as you kind of think through that
way you can catch most areas while
you're developing so I hope that helps
it's an
exact science I admit but that's the way
we've we've gotten by on a pretty large
website</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
