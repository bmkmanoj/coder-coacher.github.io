responses and we hope you take it
seriously there are two options for what
happened in option one one or more of
those feedback messages said that now
isn't the right time for you to begin
this no degree maybe you don't have some
background knowledge but you can get it
and once you get it you will be ready
and remember even once you are ready to
start the program there still will be
challenges along the way exactly and
option two is that you are ready and if
you decide to make this commitment
there's a good chance that in a matter
of months your career will be
drastically different but even if you're
ready and you do make the commitment
this will still be challenging it's
perfectly possible that over the next
several months you'll have times where
things feel challenging where you feel
frustrated you feel overwhelmed or maybe
you can feel like you don't belong in
this program I wouldn't even say
perfectly possible I would say very
probable and those things are going to
happen when your code won't run and you
don't know why or you feel lost in
intimidating jargon that you don't
understand or when you're trying to
install software and it won't run or
someone in the forum is way ahead of you
when these things happen understand that
they happen to everybody right and some
of that struggle is unavoidable and
actually productive it's just what
learning feels like and in those moments
when you're struggling it's important to
remember too that you have a whole
community of your fellow students out
there to help you as well as your team
of Udacity coaches here and Google yes
Google amazing resource definitely
figure out how to answer your own
questions but not all of the struggle
will be the productive kind sometimes it
will be because we made a mistake and
we're constantly learning and improving
too so maybe our instructions weren't
clear or maybe we assume something we
shouldn't have when you're struggling be
sure to let us know so like Andy said we
can learn from your feedback because
that's that's how we learn how to
improve right the bottom line is there
will be times when this is hard but if
you persevere you will succeed whatever
you choose to learn next and however you
choose to learn it remember that for
every obstacle you encounter you'll be
able to do amazing new things as a
result of it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
