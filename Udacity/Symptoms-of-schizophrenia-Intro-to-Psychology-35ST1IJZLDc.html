delusions delusions are often bizarre in
grandiose and they are a part of a
patently false belief system that is
maintained in spite of its irrationality
for example a person may believe he is
Jesus Christ and moreover these appear
to be very real to the person so that
person would actually believe that he
was in fact Jesus Christ we also have
hallucinations and these are convincing
sensory experiences that occur in the
absence of an external stimulus auditory
hallucinations are the most common and
involved hearing voices inside their
head often telling them negative things
about themselves or even sometimes
telling the person to injure another
individual however some people with
schizophrenia have reported that there
are sometimes more positive voices in
their heads in terms of intentions we
can also have visual hallucinations this
involves seeing things that aren't
really there there can be tactile
hallucinations and this involves feeling
something that isn't there and finally
we can even have olfactory
hallucinations which is smelling
something that isn't there either
delusions and hallucinations are
considered positive symptoms because
they are not present in people in
general</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
