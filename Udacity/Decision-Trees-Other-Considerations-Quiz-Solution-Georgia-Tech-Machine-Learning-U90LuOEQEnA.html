alright does it make sense to repeat an
attribute along a path in a tree so it
seems like it could be know in that you
know if we're looking at attributes like
you know is a true then later we
wouldn't ask again is a true because we
would already have known the answer to
that right and by the way information
gain will pick that up for you
automatically ah it doesn't have to be a
special thing in the algorithm if if you
consider an attribute that you've
already split on you're not going to
gain any information so it's going to be
the worst thing to split on exactly all
right good it seems like maybe you're
trying to lead us on because this we're
in the continuous attributes portion of
our show okay well what's the answer
there's the answer not also false well
we wouldn't want to ask the same
question about the same attribute so we
wouldn't have aged between 20 and 30 and
then later ask again aged between 20 and
30 but maybe we would want to ask you
know given that we're less than 20 where
are we teenagers or not so we might have
a different range on age later in the
tree so that's exactly right Michael so
the answer is no it does not make sense
to repeat an attribute along a path of
the tree for discrete valued attributes
however for continuous valued attributes
it does make sense because what you're
actually doing is asking a different
question so one way to think about this
is that the question is age in the 20s
or not is actually a discrete valued
attribute that you've just created for
the purposes of the decision tree so
asking that question again does it make
sense but asking a different question
about age does in fact make sense so
once you know that you are not in the
20s you might ask well am i less than 20
years old maybe a teenager or am i
greater than 40 how old am i 40 point
greater than 44 in which case I'm old so
if it's if you ask the tree that you
drew isn't quite right though right yeah
no because if you go down the false
branch it means you are less than 20 no
I could be greater than 30 oh good line
yes I'm very clever or at least I
accidentally got it right one of the two
is the same thing okay so there you go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
