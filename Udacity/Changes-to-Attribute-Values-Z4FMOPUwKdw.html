specifying the properties of the results
of the computation of a function we
might also consider situations where the
effect of a particular operation is to
change the attribute values for some
class how might we do that well let's
consider the example of a bank account
and has an attribute which is the
current balance and has operations for
deposits and withdrawals we might wish
to guarantee that the balance the
current balance reflects any deposits
that are made and any withdrawals that
are taken out how might we express such
a constraint well here's an example if
we have a deposit operation in the
account class that takes a real argument
which is the amount being deposited and
as a sanity check we make sure that that
amount is greater than 0 that's the
precondition we might try to express the
post condition with something like
saying the balance equals balance plus
the amount however remember that ocl is
a declarative language and equal sign
here means equality it doesn't mean
assignment so what we're saying with
this as the way that it's written is the
balance equals the balance plus the
amount well that can't be the case right
that doesn't make sense fortunately ocl
has a mechanism for allowing us to
express these sorts of situations where
we're changing changing values and that
particular mechanism is consists of an @
sign followed by the the word pre and
what that denotes is the value before
the operation executed if we don't use
at pre than what we're seeing when we
express balance or deposit or anything
like that is the value afterwards so we
can express the postcondition this time
correctly by saying that balance equals
balance at pre plus amount that is we
take the previous fit the previous
balance add in the amount being
deposited and we get the new balance
looks like an assignment statement but
it's really inequality</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
