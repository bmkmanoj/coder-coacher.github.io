imagine you're building a user interface
for screenreader users only so you don't
need to create any visual you I at all
just provide enough information for the
screen reader to use how would you
express the form interface we used in
the previous exercise well what you'd be
creating is kind of an API describing
the page structure that sounds kind of
like the Dom API but we can get away
with less information and fewer nodes
because a lot of that information is
useful only for visual presentation so
if something like this this enables a
screen reader user to jump in between
high level sections and then get enough
information about each form elements
affordances to know how to fill them in
remember for a screen reader user the
screen reader provides the affordances
based on the role alone without caring
about the visual style this is more or
less what the browser actually does
present to the screen reader what
happens is that the browser takes the
Dom tree and modifies it to turn it into
a form which is useful to assistive
technology we refer to this modified
tree as the accessibility tree in my
mind the accessibility tree conceptually
looks a bit like an HTML page from the
90s you may have seen web pages that
look like this you can picture the
mock-up I'm sure a few carefully chosen
images a lot of links a text box and a
button visually scanning down the page
in this case gives you an experience
pretty similar to what a screen reader
user would get</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
