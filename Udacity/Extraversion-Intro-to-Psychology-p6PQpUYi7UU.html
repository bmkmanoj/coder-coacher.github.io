personality an extraversion involves
being comfortable with people being
sociable talkative outgoing and it also
involves enjoying risky thrill seeking
kinds of behavior like driving fast
downhill skiing and parachute on the
other end of the spectrum is
introversion and introversion involves
shyness preferring to be alone or in
small groups of people and also wanting
to avoid high-risk kinds of behaviors
now some people wonder whether shyness
is really a necessary part of
introversion and let's be clear the
research in theory does suggest that
introverted people really are shy at
least compared to extroverted people now
two important points shyness is not
shyness all the time
shy people in fact can be very outgoing
and comfortable around people that they
know and secondly shyness is also not
the same as social anxiety it's not to
be confused because social anxiety is a
much more debilitating disorder that
we'll talk about actually in later
lessons</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
