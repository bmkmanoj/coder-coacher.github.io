we can do with find and going back to
the original description of find we said
well find returns the first position
there might be other occurrences and we
might want to find those other
occurrences the way to find those other
occurrences is we can actually pass in
an extra parameter so instead of just
passing in one string we can pass in a
second parameter which is going to be a
number so when we pass in a number what
find will output is the number of the
position in the search string where the
target string appears the first
occurrence after that position so we'll
give the first occurrence where this
target string appears in the search
string but starting from whatever
position we pass in is number so if we
pass in zero well it would start from
the beginning that would mean the same
thing as the original find if we pass in
the position here it would start from
there and would still output the same
value we found before if we start from
here well then it wouldn't find this
occurrence because this occurrence
starts after that position it would find
this one so here's an example we'll use
this quote attributed to George Danton
during the French Revolution translated
loosely it means audacity more audacity
always audacity I should mention that
Danton was actually executed so whether
you want to follow this advice or not
depends on how you think things worked
out for him but if we do a find with
Danton passing in audace with no extra
parameter we'll get position 5 which is
the position where our death starts the
first occurrence of audace is found if
we pass in a number as well well if we
pass in zero we'll also get five that's
because starting from position 0 we find
odd asset position 5 if we pass in the
number 5 we'll still get 5 as the result
starting from position 5 we find odd
asset position 5 if we pass in a number
higher than 5 let's pass in 6 well now
find is looking for an occurrence
starting from position six which is here
instead of finding the first occurrence
of audace it will find the first one
that occurs after position six which is
the one here at position 25 let's just
print out the string from position 6 to
confirm that so printing from position 6
to the end we see that the quote is
you'd ass encore and so on I'll spare
you from my poor French pronunciation
and that's why it found odd ass at this
location which is position 25 the result
always counts from the beginning of the
original string position 25 of the
original string which is where it found
the second occurrence of audace so if we
pass in 25 we'll get 25 as the output
finding the position where this
occurrence occurs if we pass in 26 now
it will start searching at position 26
which is the U here we'll find at
position 47 the final occurrence of
audace though seeing the string from
position 47 to the n starting from here
we see that now we're starting from
position 48 which is this you will get
as our output negative 1 and that's
because although the string occurs many
times in the string Danton
it doesn't occur at all starting from
position 48 and so the output a find
when the target string is not found in
the search string is negative 1 and
that's true if we start from position 48
we don't find the target string at all
in the search string</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
