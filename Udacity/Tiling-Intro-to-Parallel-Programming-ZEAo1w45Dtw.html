setting k equal to 32 and here's the
actual code I begin by figuring out the
locations of the tile corners okay this
is going to tell me where I need to
start writing in the output and start
reading from the input so just a little
bookkeeping and giving things variable
names that mean something to me but as
you can see the the place where I start
reading the I value is a function of
which block were in times the width of
the tile because each tile is
responsible for one block and that's the
case and the J value is the same but in
Y instead of X and the output simply
inverts Y and X okay so now that I know
where I need to read and write my tile
I'm gonna want to know which element of
the tile to read and write from and just
as shorthand to make the code a little
more readable I'm gonna set X to thread
index dot x and y to thread index dot Y
so now the code itself is really simple
I declare my floating point array in
shared memory K by K array of tiles and
I read from global memory and write the
result into shared memory so here's my
read from global memory and it's
function of where I start in where the
tile starts + which thread I'm
responsible or which element this thread
is responsible for in the tile to avoid
an extra sink threads I'm gonna go ahead
and write this into shared memory in
transposed fashion so it's not tile X Y
it's tile Y X okay that that saves one
of these sync threads barriers now I've
got the transposed tile sitting in
shared memory it's already been
transposed and I want to write it out to
global memory and I want to write it out
in a coalesced fashion so adjacent
threads write adjacent locations in
memory
in other words adjacent threads are
varying by X the way I've set this out
so here's my right to global memory
after my read from shared memory you
could have done this in two sync threads
you could have read this into shared
memory perform the transpose and written
it out to global memory and you would
have needed a sync threads after reading
it into shared memory and again after
performing the transpose so if you did
that I encourage you to go back
and convert it to this single version
and see how much faster it goes let's go
ahead and run this on my laptop okay
there's two interesting things to note
here one is that the amount of time
taken by the parallel per element code
the kernel that we had before actually
went up it's almost twice as slow now as
it was before and if you think about it
this code didn't change at all except
that we changed the value of K we
changed the size of the thread block
that's being used in this code we're
going to come back to that that's going
to give us a hint as to a further
optimization in the meantime transpose
parallel per element tiled our new
version is a little bit faster not a lot
faster and that's kind of disturbing we
should have gone to perfectly coalesced
loads and stores which should have made
a difference let's go ahead and fire up
in V VP again and see what happened</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
