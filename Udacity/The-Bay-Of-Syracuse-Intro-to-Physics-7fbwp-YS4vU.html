Syracuse now Syracuse is on the water it
is on an island after all and it has a
bay that looks somewhat like this but
please don't go to Google Maps to
confirm because this is not a great
drawing on this Bay this Bay has a mouth
here and and on this northern point here
there is lighthouse which I've drawn
over here I want to determine a way to
figure out the width of the mouth of
this Bay using trigonometry let's see
what we can do we can measure the height
of the lighthouse or we could ask the
lighthouse keeper the height of this
lighthouse is 25 meters I can position
myself on the other Shore down here get
real low to the ground and use a device
like a sextant or a quadrant which is
just a device that lets you measure
angle and I can measure what this angle
is right here it turns out this angle is
1.30 degrees now I think you have the
ability to tell me given this
information this angle and this height
what is the width of the Bay of Syracuse
what is this distance you can enter your
answer here and do it in meters</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
