define our access control policy and
then we have to do enforcement based on
what is in that policy clearly that
policy defines who can access what and
things like that that kind of
information we're gonna abstract that in
a data structure that is called an
access control matrix or an ACM if it's
a matrix in this case an access control
matrix that is going to abstract all the
state that is relevant for making those
access control decisions
well matrices have rows and columns to
define a matrix you have to say what
rows it has what kind of columns it has
what does it store in each element or
each cell of the matrix so an access
control matrix rows are defined by the
users or subjects that we have in the
group so rows actually correspond to the
sources of requests or the subjects or
the users so this access control metrics
if Alice is a user in the system there
is going to be a row for Alice
well other thing that a matrix has to
define this two-dimensional matrix we
are talking about is we have to define
its columns rows correspond to users
actually columns gonna correspond to
resources that we have in the system so
each resource that needs to be protected
remember we need to know who is allowed
to access it or not so this matrix is
sort of telling you for a given user
that's a row and a given resource or
object what can be done so the columns
are going to correspond to all the
resources that need to be protected in
the system so an access control matrix
since I'm talking about rows and columns
and it's two dimensions any particular
entry or cell in this matrix can be
defined by what we have here u comma au
where the row that is corresponds to
user U and the column for object o you
start with a user continue until you get
to the object that we're talking about
so that element of the matrix or cell of
the matrix is actually going to define
what kind of access rights user u has
for object o so if this was a file and
the access rights can be read write
execute whatever
subset of those access rights then we
sang the entry in the matrix if you look
at the row for user you and object o is
going to say if you can read this object
o R is present in that entry that means
the user can read object o matrix access
control matrix is based on users we have
in the system resources we have in the
system and the state actually it
captures is who has what kind of access
for the resources of the system that's
what each entry of the matrix is going
to answer a question for a given user
and a given object or resource</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
