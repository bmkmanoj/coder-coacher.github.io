software development and relate to
things like agile development and
continuous integration that have been
around for a while agile software
development is based on iterative
development where requirements and
solutions evolve via a collaboration
between self-organizing cross-functional
teams the term was coined in 2001 when
the agile manifesto was formulated so
it's been around for a bit longer than
DevOps but in many organizations using
agile development not everybody has been
invited to the party now there's a good
chance do you already use some form of
agile development in your organization
but it covers just a couple of steps in
the whole process there are other steps
that need to be covered agile
development generally covers the steps
from planning to coding to building and
testing and then iterating on the design
again it also emphasizes collaboration
between cross-functional teams testing
here includes unit testing of code as
well as integration testing and user
acceptance testing but agile doesn't
necessarily speak to release process and
deployment and operation can look very
similar in an agile organization to in a
traditional software organization and
that's not necessarily the best solution
when we start to improve this by
automating build in unit test processes
this is covered by continuous
integration the automation process helps
to the iterative development and make
sure that changes or new features do not
break other functionality automating it
all the way to the release is covered by
continuous delivery continuous delivery
pipeline also makes it easy to control
user testing and release the software
run all the tests pass now to make sure
it's possible to deploy all these
releases into production to thousands or
maybe millions of users there has to be
an automated scalable way to run
operations and to make sure that
everything runs smoothly and to improve
the whole process over time it's
necessary to measure it all but for that
measurement to be actionable there has
to be good communication and a culture
of sharing and collaborating between all
the teams involved adding automation to
the system is good but it's only when
you combine it with the culture of
communication and collaboration between
teams that you really have the DevOps
approach to the software lifecycle</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
