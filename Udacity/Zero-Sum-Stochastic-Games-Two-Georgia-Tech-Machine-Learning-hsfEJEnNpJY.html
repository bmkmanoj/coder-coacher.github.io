actually get some wonderful properties
coming out so here's some things that we
know about this this setup for zero-sum
stochastic games value iteration works
so we can actually solve this system of
equations by using the evaluated value
iteration trick which is to say the you
know we initialize these two values to
whatever and then we just iterate this
as an assignment all right we just say
you know equals so value duration works
this minimax queue algorithm converges
under the same kinds of conditions that
q-learning converges so we get this nice
you know q-learning analog in this multi
agent setting the Q star that's defined
by these equations is unique so we
iterated and we find it and it's just
there's just that one answer the
policies for the two players can be
computed independently that is to say if
two different players are running
minimax Q on their own and not really
coordinating which other except for by
playing the game that the policies that
they get out will actually converge to
minimax optimal policies so it really
does solve the the zero-sum game which
is maybe not so surprising because you
know they are trying to kill each other
after all so the idea that they'd have
to collaborate to do that efficiently
would be weird I never thought about it
like that but you know that would be
where the this update that I've written
here can be computed efficiently which
is to say in polynomial time because
this minimax can be computed using
linear programming of course and finally
if we actually iterate this Q equation
and and it's converging to Q star
knowing Q star is enough to figure out
how to behave optimally so we can
convert these Q values into an actual
behavior again by using the the solution
in the linear program so it's just like
MVP is a value iteration look you learn
exactly it's like we've gone to a second
agent and it really hasn't impacted
things negatively at all this is this is
all the pretty much all the things that
we want come out there there are some
things that don't come out for example
in the case of an MVP we can solve these
system of linear equations in polynomial
time not just by value duration but we
can actually set it up as a single in
your program and solve it and be done in
linear time or sorry not linear time
pono
time this is not known to be true in the
zero-sum stochastic game case it's not
known whether it can be solved in
polynomial time hmm so that it is a
little harder as a problem but it's you
know not harder not deeply harder and
not harder in a way that matters in a
machine learning setting cool so this is
really great
so let's um let's try to take the same
approach and see if we can deal with
general sum games okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
