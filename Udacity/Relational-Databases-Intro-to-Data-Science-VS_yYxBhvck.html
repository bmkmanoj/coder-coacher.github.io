relational databases are useful because
it is straightforward to extract data
with complex queries a database scales
well and relational databases ensure
data is consistently formatted what do
each of these mean well first off it's
easy to extract data from the database
with a complex one-line query we can
easily say choose all records for people
where their age is greater than 50 and
their weight is less than 50 and the
city is equal to Mumbai we can do this
with flat files as well but it's a lot
more work databases also scale well it
is not uncommon to have databases with
hundreds of thousands or millions of
entries since all information is ideally
stored in one location it's easy to
update delete and add new data to the
database in a scalable way think of the
odd hard data for example India has a
population of 1.2 billion people that's
a really big data set it's important to
have a solution that scales well finally
relational databases have a concept of
something called a schema which
basically says that each column in a
table is always of the same type you
can't have some people's age be a string
while the age of others is an INT
relational databases are built to have
as little redundancy as possible that
way if we want to update a value we all
need to do it in one place and we can
ensure that our data remains consistent
throughout the entire database also
relational databases are well
established and have been used for some
time even if they were hot and new
that's not a great reason to use a
technology and now that we know why
relational databases might be useful
let's discuss how to use them in more
detail</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
