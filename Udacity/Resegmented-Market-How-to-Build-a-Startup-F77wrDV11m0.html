hypothesis about who the customers are
that is you think you understand what
your fit is either in low cost or their
specific niche needs and so you might
have a better fit for them and
competitors there's many of you're wrong
but very few if you're right and your
risk is that you get the market and
product redefinition just wrong you
didn't do enough customer discovery and
you say no no this is how we're gonna
enter this existing market we're gonna
go after these set of users specifically
and oops you were wrong
a great example of this is what
Southwest did Southwest took on the
airline industry by bringing up the
traditional hub-and-spoke model and
providing just very limited services but
for an extremely low price</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
