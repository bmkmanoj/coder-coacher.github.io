version of vertex cover here so as an
input we're giving a graph tree with n
vertices and an integer K and the output
is yes if G has a vertex cover of size
at most K and no otherwise so the first
time you see this kind of use of the
if-better function it might still seem a
bit strange to you so I'm going to
explain to you what it does and how
we're using it here we're using this if
better function to guess for us which
vertices to put into the vertex cover
and which vertices we can leave out then
we check if the assignment is valid
although actually we wouldn't have to do
that but I'll get into that in a minute
and if the size of the assignment that
we have found is at most K we say yes
the graph has a vertex cover of size at
most K and no otherwise so as you can
see we're putting a lot of trust into
this part here of the function because
we're basically trusting the if-better
to tell us correctly whether we should
put a vertex into the vertex cover or
whether we shouldn't do that and that is
why I basically said that the computer
that has this function available is
extremely powerful because if you can
trust the if-better to do exactly what
we want for us which is guess the best
possible assignment then of course this
significantly changes the running time
of the algorithm here so let's do a
little quiz what is the running time of
this algorithm here for a graph with n
vertices if we can trust the if-better
function to perform as specified and
guess the best possible assignment of
zeros and ones to the vertices</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
