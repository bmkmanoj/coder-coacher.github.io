experiment in space since we know that
the laws of physics on earth have the
same as those in the heavens any
experiment we can contrive that occurs
in space what should teach us about
something that could also occur on the
earth now for this thought experiment I
want you to imagine drifting out alone
in the cold depths of space actually for
this experiment I want us to be so deep
in space that we can't even see the
stars or the Sun or the earth we are
truly floating in the middle of nowhere
now as far as we can tell we are
completely motionless now let's say you
turn on your flashlight because every
good scientist floating in the depths of
space remembers to bring your flashlight
you turn on your flashlight and often
the distance you see another astronaut
floating in the depths of space you're
not alone in fact this other astronaut
is slowly drifting towards you now I
wonder what this astronaut was thinking
before you turn the light on I wonder if
she thought she was motionless or if she
thought she was moving it's clear that
relative to each other you're moving
towards each other but it's not clear to
me who's moving maybe you know so I want
you to think about this question which
of these two astronauts is moving is
astronaut one the one who's truly moving
is astronaut two of the one who's
actually moving maybe they're both
moving maybe neither of them is moving
maybe they're both motionless or is it
impossible to say I want you to really
think about this question and don't
worry if you get it wrong because this
is not a completely intuitive concept</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
