rectangles and you may wonder whether
they're other shapes that you can use
and indeed you can and I'm going to show
you now more about the graphics library
that you get with this course it's a
simple library I've created it
especially for this course it's very
similar to the standard Java library but
it's a bit easier to use you can find
the full documentation on the web but
let's just walk through the basics so
you get a feel for what you can do here
is an example of a silly drawing that
you can create when you look at the
drawing you can see rectangles lines
circles and text you already know about
rectangles so let's move on to the other
elements let's say you want to draw a
line from this point to this one you
need the coordinates of the start at the
end and then you simply construct the
line by giving the coordinates to the
line constructor you store the object in
a variable and when you're ready to draw
it you call the draw method just like
you would for rectangles now let's say
you want to draw a circle or an ellipse
a circle is just an ellipse that's
symmetrical find the rectangle that fits
around the ellipse determine its
top-left corner its width and its height
and then construct the ellipse really in
the same way as you would have
constructed the surrounding rectangle
finally if you want to show some text
specify the top-left corner point and
construct a text object simply give the
coordinates and the message that you
want to display that in a nutshell is
our graphics library sarah has prepared
a couple of simple practice problems for
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
