criminal you specifically a bank robber
and from the bank you stole three things
a statue a mask and an urn and I should
probably draw pictures to help you
visualize the scenario so now I've added
pictures believe me you have no idea how
long that took to draw and to make any
scenario more realistic we're going to
add of course monetary and physical
attributes to each of these items earn
you want to steal weighs 15 kilograms
and cost thirty thousand dollars then
the scary mask weighs nine kilograms and
is worth sixteen thousand dollars and
lastly we have the urn the urn weighs
eight kilograms and costs $15,000 so now
i present to you a question you didn't
go to the gym enough and you can only
carry 20 kilograms so how would you
solve this well one thing you might do
is in fear in a hurry and you're about
to be chased down by the police is take
the one that weighs the least and try to
get as many things as possible hoping
that you'll make enough money from just
the sheer number another opportunity
mighty to take the one that is worth the
most kind of ignoring what it weighs
another choice would be to calculate the
ratio between the weight and how much
it's worth that way you choose items as
long as you can carry them based on the
cost per kilogram basically the amount
of money you're making / wait it turns
out all three of those solutions just
don't work for this problem the last one
will work if you can take say half an
urn but for this you don't really want
to take half the urn it's it's worth
nothing unless it's all together and
same for the mass and sacchi so you want
to choose specifically which items to
take so taking the statute alone doesn't
work and it turns out the correct answer
is to take the mask and the urn so this
is a surprisingly common problem in
computer science and
I suppose if you're in a life of crime
it comes up often too in computer
science and economics this comes up when
dealing with kind of resource allocation
and making choices about which items to
choose based on how much a cost function
and how much they're worth you so this
is tricky to do quickly and so we're not
going to ask you to do it I mean you
could enumerate all the possibilities
but that doesn't really scale once you
get to say I don't know 15 20 items so
we're going to ask you to do is to write
two functions that would help us check
whether or not a given solution is
correct the first function we're going
to write is called heist valid and this
is going to return true or false on
whether or not the items you are
stealing is a valid thing to take away
we're going to ask if everything you're
trying to steal is less than the total
weight that you can carry and then we're
going to think about heist total which
given a list of things you're going to
steal returns how much all those items
are worth so high salad for the mask in
the urn because that's correct answer 9
+ 8 is less than 20 so we're going to
return true and the heist total we're
going to add 16 and 15 and return that
total pretty straightforward but we're
going to add it make it a little bit
more tricky since we know how skilled
you are and require you to give a
one-line solution and this doesn't
really come off up often when you're in
the real world programming but we're for
enforcing it here so that we encourage
you to use list comprehensions and kind
of think outside the box so what are our
inputs when I take in three things a
dictionary that essentially catalogs all
the things that were able to steal each
key in our dictionary is the name of the
item that we can steal and the value is
a tuple where the first entry in the
tuple is the weight of the item and
kilograms and the second entry is the
monetary value of the tuple in dollars
although the units here don't really
matter as long as we're consistent we
also have a limit to what we can carry
and lastly we have
list of strings corresponding to the
keys here of what we've taken so let's
do the first function since it's one
line we have to return something it's
probably going to start with a return
keyword so what we're going to do is one
line is add up the weight for each item
that we've taken and see if it's less
than the limit and because pythons so
awesome this is pretty easy so we're
going to take the sum of a list
comprehension that generates a list of
the weight of each item that we've taken
this is going to be the name of the item
and that's how we're going to get the
tuple out of the dictionary we just care
about the first item and that dictionary
and forex and taken so we're going to go
through each string and take and list
look up the value in the dictionary
corresponding to that item and take the
first element in the tuple which is the
weight and we want to return that in our
list so I want to take the sum of that
and we're simply going to check if it's
less than equal to the limits that's our
one line solution array the next problem
is going to have a very similar answer
in this case we're going to go through
each item and taken get the tuple out of
the available dictionary for that item
and simply sum up the cost here's the
key difference so this list
comprehension returns a list of all the
values of each item and we're going to
take the someone returned it those are
our one line solutions to each of those
functions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
