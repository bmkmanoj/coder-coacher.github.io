common tricks for school or exam or test
questions is to work from the bottom up
and see if there's extra information you
can glean X plus something has to be
equal to Z and not super handy yet
something is exactly equal to hello well
wait right up here we assigned y equals
hello so as long as I don't overwrite
why with to this should totally work y
is equal to hello because we just did
the assignment a few lines up all right
now let's take a look at the rest of
these I need to add something to X to
get Z that suggests that X is smaller
than Z because we don't have any
negative numbers to play with in this
example so I'm gonna have to add
something like one or two or whatnot to
X to get z well if I really think that x
is less than Z then this line is
probably true but in order for this to
print out true and not give some sort of
error I'm going to have to assign to the
value X and the value Z before I get
here so one of these will have to be X
and one of them will have to be Z since
I want X to be smaller let's try this
out x is 1 z is too all right so then 1
is less than 2 that's going to be true y
is equal to hello that's going to be
true and now we have print X plus
something is equal to Z well X is 1 and
z is too so we'd really like to just
write one in here but remember the rules
of this puzzle we can only write X Y or
Z so we'll write another X since X is 1
1 plus one equals two</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
