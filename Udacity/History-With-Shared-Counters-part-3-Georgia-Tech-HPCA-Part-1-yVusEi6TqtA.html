we have something like a branch that is
just always taken in that case the entry
for that branch will just be all ones in
the history that branch has a fixed PC
it always has the same history when we
xtour them we will be using only one two
bit counter
so pretty much although we have a long
history if the branch is just a
repetition of the same thing we are
ending up using only one of the two bit
counters so the additional cost relative
to just having an array of two bit
counters is that now we are keeping an
11-bit history for this branch so still
the cost is not just two bits it's
really let's say 11 or 16 bits plus 2
but it's much less than a long history
plus 2 to the end times a two bit
counter if we have a branch that is
never taken we can do the same reasoning
and end up using a single counter if we
have a branch that has something like
empty and tea it really has only two
possible histories 0 1 0 1 0 1 etc or 1
0 1 0 1 0 etc so it ends up using two
counters so if we have a lot of
discounters as you can see most branches
are going to be like these we will be
using very very few entries by these
branches which leaves us plenty of
counters for branches where we have a
very long pattern where we will be using
something like you know 16 histories and
thus use something like 16 counters as
you can see in this organization pretty
much the branches that need more
counters get them the branches that need
relatively few counters get them the
only really additional cost relative to
just having the counters is the
histories the downside is that again
some branches with particular histories
might overlap in which counter they use
with other branches and other histories
pretty much my branch exit with its
history might map to the same counter as
some other branch and its own history
when they react sort but this happens
very rarely if the BHT is large
now it can be large because each entry
is just two bits</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
