answers in our grid let's remember what
the general formula for slope is we can
find two points along any of these lines
and then compare them using this formula
to find the slope the first line v is a
really interesting case if we pick any
two points along it let's say negative 7
3 and negative 3 3 you'll notice that
they the same y-coordinate they have the
same vertical position that means that
our numerator of our slope formula is
going to be 0 since we'll just have 3
minus 30 divided by any number except 0
is just 0 so the slope of V is just 0 W
is another really interesting case it's
this vertical line right here although
the points along w have a wide variety
of Y values they all have exactly the
same x value x equals negative 5 for any
point we could place along this line so
let's just pick 2 again maybe this point
negative 5 6 and this point negative 5
negative 1 then we have negative 1 minus
6 over negative 5 plus 5 but this
quantity on the bottom is going to give
us 0 and we know that we can't divide by
0 that is just not allowed at least not
for right now so what we say is that
this slope is undefined line X is
pointing up to the right so it's slope
is positive and if we step over one to
the right we have to step up more than
one to rejoin our line so its slope is
not a fraction it's greater than 1 the
line y also has a positive slope but if
we pick a point and move over one to the
right we have to move less than one unit
up to rejoin the graph so this slope is
a fraction line Z points down to the
right so as we saw before its slope is
negative</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
