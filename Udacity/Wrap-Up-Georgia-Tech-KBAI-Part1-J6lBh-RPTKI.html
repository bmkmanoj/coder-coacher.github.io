today we started off today by talking
about one of the most important concepts
in all of knowledge-based AI which are
knowledge representations as we go
forward in this class will see that
knowledge representations are really at
the heart of almost everything will do
we didn't talked about semantic networks
which are a particular kind of knowledge
representation and we use those to talk
about the different criteria for a good
knowledge representation what do good
knowledge representations enable us to
do and what do they help us avoid we
then talked about kind of an abstract
class of problem solving methods called
representing reason representing reason
really lies under all of knowledge-based
AI and it's a way of representing
knowledge and then reasoning over it we
then talked a little bit about
augmenting that with weights which
allows us to come to more nuanced and
specific conclusions in the next couple
weeks we're going to use these semantic
networks to talk about a few different
problem-solving methods next time we'll
talk about generate and test and then
we'll move on to a couple slightly
different ones called means-ends
analysis and problem reduction</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
