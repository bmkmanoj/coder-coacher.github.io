partition technique the goal is to
identify categories or categories are
characteristics of each input element so
let me illustrate what that means using
an example and to do that I'm gonna use
again the example of the split program
as we are already familiar with it and
we kind of already played with it
when we were talking about the generic
black box approach so let me bring back
the program and let me remind you that
what the program does is to take two
inputs a string and the size and it
breaks down the string into chunks whose
length is size if we look at the split
program there are two input elements STR
and size so we're gonna identify
categories for these two so starting
from STR what are they interesting
characteristics of a string in this step
you're gonna use your domain knowledge
your understanding of what the string is
and for example we might identify the
length of the string and the content of
the string as the two main
characteristics that we want to focus on
if we now move our focus to size the
only characteristic I can really think
of for an integer is its value so that's
what I'm gonna mark here so at the end
of this step what we have is that we
have two categories so two interesting
characteristics for the string input STR
which are at the length and the content
and one category for the integer input
size which is its value and notice that
there's not only one solution so there's
not only one possibility so the specific
characteristics that you will identify
are somehow subjective but the important
point is that you identify
characteristics that are meaningful and
the sort of cover the main aspects of
the inputs which is the case for the
categories that we identify in this
example</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
