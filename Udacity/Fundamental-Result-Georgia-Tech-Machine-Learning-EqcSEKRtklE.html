you you so desperately wanted you ready
yep I'm gonna read it to you because you
can't read in a two player zero-sum
deterministic game of perfect
information minimax equals maximum all
right you told us what minimax was but
you didn't tell us what maxi min was
well maximun is like minimax except the
other way around so a is trying to you
know one side is trying to minimize the
maximum the other side is trying to
maximize the minimum
it's exactly what we described before it
just depends upon the whether you're
looking at it from a point of view or
B's point of view oh I see like do you
choose a column first or do you choose a
row first exactly so whether you go a
first followed by B or B first followed
by a you're in going to end up in the
same with the same result and that more
importantly or at least as importantly
there always exists an optimal pure
strategy for each player in other words
you can solve those games and you know
what the answer is once you write down
the matrix you just do minimax or you do
maximum and you end up with the proper
answer and now you know what the optimal
players would do now there's a subtlety
here which I got it a little bit in the
previous slide when I talked about
rational agents and what we're sort of
assuming and everything that we discuss
here is that people are always trying to
maximize their rewards okay so we define
the the reinforcement learning problem
that way the my goal is to find a policy
that maximizes my long term expected
reward you know so I'm trying to get the
best reward that I can and what you're
assuming here is that everyone else is
doing the same thing and they're
assuming that everyone else is doing the
same thing okay
does that make sense it does though I'm
a little bit stuck on this word optimal
for at the moment right well that's what
I'm trying to get it actually that
optimal here really means I'm maximizing
the reward that I can get and I'm
assuming everyone else is doing the same
thing and I'm furthermore I'm assuming
that they're assuming that everyone else
is doing the same thing so so I guess
I'm wondering whether whether this
theorem is vacuous in the sense that are
we defining optimal to be minimax what
we're defining optimal to be I think so
that's that's a good question I think I
would I would unroll the vacuous Ness
one level
saying this optimal here basically has
to be optimal with respect to what and
the respect to what here is the
underlying assumption that everyone is
trying to maximize their rewards and
that everyone knows this so in a world
where you have perfect information it's
zero sum then the strategy of minimax
and maximin give you the same answer and
that furthermore there is always some
place where the column and the row cross
the best column in the best row cross
and that is always going to be the
solution to that particular game now if
we weren't in a two player zero-sum
determinates a game of perfect
information that might not be the case
but in a case where we're in this sort
of simplest version where everyone's
being rational that is optimal that is
trying to maximize their their own
reward and is assuming everyone else is
maximizing their own reward this is the
right thing to do now I've got a little
weasel world here as well which we're
going to get to in a moment which is
this notion not just of a strategy but
of a pure strategy and it's going to
there's a reason why we have notions of
pure strategies because in the end as we
get more complicated we're gonna have to
deal with impure strategies okay but are
you with me so far I think so yeah yeah
they're basically all that stuff we did
an AI with game trees and search is kind
of the what you would expect people to
do if they knew everything so so I feel
like I could prove this theorem in the
case of trees because you just prop it
you just kind of compute values from the
leaves up to the root yeah and it and it
doesn't matter there's no notion of who
goes first or who goes second so there's
there's going to be one answer to that
process it's not obvious to me how to
show it if you once you've turn the tree
into a matrix that that matrix I guess
because it captures the same information
it ought to be the case that this is
still true but like I'd have to sit down
and kind of think it through know and
it's also to help you think it through I
guess what I would suggest is if you
have the matrix you can create a tree
that's consistent with it because every
row and every column represents a
strategy you don't know what that
strategy is but you can since it's a
finite matrix you can construct a tree
that is consistent with that matrix in
fact possibly an infinite number of them
I'm not sure but you can certainly
consider
at least one that is consistent with it
and then once you have the tree you just
do what you say good all right good
so we've got this fundamental result and
now what we're going to do is we're
going to try to be a bit more
interesting but but it was important to
go through this because now we've got
some basic vocabulary and some basic
building blocks okay yep all right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
