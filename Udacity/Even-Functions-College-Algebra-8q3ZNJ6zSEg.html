dividing all of these even functions in
half is the y-axis so they have symmetry
across the y-axis just by looking we can
tell that they don't have symmetry
across the x-axis in fact none of these
even functions even have any points that
lie below the x-axis so that means that
none of the points on them that lie
above it will have corresponding points
that they're reflected across from now
these last two choices might look a
little bit complicated but taking our
time and thinking through them we can
figure out which one's true if either
one saying that F of negative x is equal
to f of X is basically saying that two
points lie on a graph this is the same
as saying that if we have the point X
comma Y or X comma f of X then we'll
also have the point negative x comma y
this is saying that when you plug in the
negative version of some x value you get
the same y value since the value of the
function is the same at those two
x-coordinates we already saw in the last
quiz that this is in fact true of even
functions so this also applies the last
insert is not since having it be true
would mean that this third one couldn't
be true</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
