two qualities to the central nervous
system that influence introversion and
extraversion and these two qualities are
cortical arousal levels and sensory
threshold levels for example by cortical
arousal we mean how much the brain is
active at rest and some people while it
rests not being stimulated their brain
is really quite active and coupled with
that often is a low sensory threshold
meaning for these people it doesn't take
much stimulation to arouse them and we
call these people who have this pattern
introverts and introverts are often
regulating their behavior in order to
optimize their arousal level so they
withdraw from people they don't know
they tend to avoid real sensory
experiences like parachuting and
rollercoaster rides and jumping off
cliffs into water so on the other hand
we see the opposite pattern in
extroverts and in extroverts we have low
cortical arousal and high sensory
threshold meaning that at rest the brain
activity of extroverts is relatively low
in activity and coupled with that is a
high sensory threshold meaning it takes
more stimulation to arouse extroverts so
they regulate their behavior and arousal
levels by seeking out stimulation they
really want to be around people around
noisy environments do thrill-seeking and
risky kinds of things like parachuting
and rollercoaster riding and jumping off
cliffs so you may or may not have
noticed that in fact we filmed these two
different scenes talking about
introversion and extraversion in
different environments so when we were
talking about in introverts we were in a
white background room and now we're in a
room with more colors and there's more
going on this was not a coincidence
because as it turns out introverts tend
to feel more comfortable in in rooms and
environments where there's less going on
and extroverts tend to feel more
comfortable in rooms and environments
where there's more going on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
