real benefits of this particular
formulation of hashing are that our
lookups again are constant time and
that's terrific for parallelism for a
machine like the GPU because we keep all
of our threads busy
there's no thread divergence at all and
the construction algorithm is actually
pretty simple and pretty fast it's
actually a very efficient hash table
construction when it's done in shared
memory with a small set of items to hash
but it turns out that it actually works
fairly well with large data sets when
the hash table needs to be constructed
in main memory a really important thing
to keep in mind there is that the
operation of write my item into the hash
table and kick the other item out needs
to be an atomic operation in our
implementation we used atomic exchange
to make sure that two competing threads
don't have any possibility of stomping
on top of each other and a final note
there's more than one way we might solve
this general problem of check of an
element is in a set instead of using
hash tables we could choose a fairly
brute force way to do this we could
choose to sort all the elements in the
set as a construction step and then for
the lookup step we could do binary
search into the set to see if that
particular element is present so for
instance we might have five keys here in
a set to construct this particular data
structure we sort these in order of the
key and to do lookup we just do binary
search within this set so for instance
if we're looking up value k-6 with one
thread we'd go see k5 oh my keys bigger
than that I'd then pop this way and so
on until I get to k-6 I might have
another thread that's looking up k3 it
would start in the middle at k5 and then
do binary search until it finds k3 now
sorting is quite fast on GPUs and even
though hash tables are faster for this
particular computation that's so much
faster that you should never consider a
sword to be a good idea often on the GPU
sometimes a brute force approach like
sort and binary search might be your
best option</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
