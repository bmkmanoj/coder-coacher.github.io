design or analogical design we'll talk
about a specific problem let us suppose
that you design a robot that can walk on
water nature already offers several
examples of organisms that can walk on
water this is a picture of the basilisk
lizard which can walk very well on water
and catch its prey recall that we said
earlier that for a neurological mapping
and transfer to occur well requires a
deep understanding of the source case in
the target problem that is true here as
well in case of analogical design we
require a deep understanding of the
local motion of the basilisk lizard in
order to be able to design a robot it
can walk in water inspired by the design
of the basilisk lizard here is a model
of the basilisk lizard this model is
sometimes called structure behavior
function model this particular picture
doesn't show the structure just shows a
function in the behavior the function is
shown at the top here it is shown by its
initial state and its goal state and
this function is achieved by the
behavior shown here the behavior is
represented as a series of states and
transitions between those states will
not talk about the representations in
more detail here readings given in the
cross nodes give these representations
are a lot more detail if you're so
interested</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
