hard to build you probably have heard of
examples of complex systems getting into
deadlock states or otherwise freezing up
because of the combinatorial blow up in
complexity that occurs from all the
internal things that are going on so you
have to spend some time in getting these
things right and some kind of behavioral
modeling technique right state charts
okay can be very helpful to you in
getting that kind of assurance besides
state charts uomo provides other
diagrams that can be used for
understanding behavior okay we've
already seen these in our review of UML
activity diagram sequence diagrams
collaborations use cases communication
timing interaction / few diagrams okay
outside of UML there's a couple of other
behavioral modeling approaches which
I'll just mention to you we won't go
into it one of those is temporal logic
if you've heard of model checking and
model checking tools these are ways of
modeling system and asking can I ever
get into this certain state that I don't
want to get into okay am I am I ensured
that I can't get into it okay a model
checking tools can help you get answers
to that problem another notation for
expressing concurrency is process
algebra these allow you to specify what
things can go on concurrently and the
reeds and right behavior between the
concurrently executing activities we
will be looking further into state
charts we will doing an exercise that
ask you to learn the features this is
such an essential part of getting models
right that one up make sure that you've
kind of acquired that skill</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
