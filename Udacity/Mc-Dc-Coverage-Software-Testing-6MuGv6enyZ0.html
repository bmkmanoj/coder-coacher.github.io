statement if a or B and C so let's make
sure to nail down the precedents so we
don't have to remember that so if a is
true or else both B and C are true then
we're going to execute some code and so
now let's look what it takes to get full
mc/dc coverage of this bit of code so
the first thing we can see is that we're
going to need to test each of the
variables and with both two they're true
and false values because conditions that
is to say the conditions are a b and c
here need to take on all possible values
so you can see that each of the
conditions is going to need to be assign
both the true value and the false value
during the tests that we run now the
other part of mc/dc coverage that is
does every condition independently
affect the outcome of a decision is
going to be a little harder to deal with
so let's take a look so let's first
consider the input where a is true B is
false and C is true we don't even need
to look at the B and C part of the
expression because we know that if a is
true then the entire condition succeeds
this maps to a true value so what we
want to verify here is that we can come
up with a test case where every
condition independently affects the
outcome of a decision and since our
top-level operator here is an or let's
see how we can make the whole thing come
out false
well the BNC Clause already came out to
false because if B is false then the
whole thing comes out to false so if we
make a false then the entire decision
will come out to be false and if we've
changed only a and we haven't changed B
and C then we've shown that a
independently affects the outcome so
let's write another test case okay so
our second test case with a being input
is false B input is false and C is true
leads the overall decision to come out
as false so we've shown now that a
independently defects the outcome so
let's try to do the same thing for B and
C so if we want to continue trying to
leave everything the same and only
change the value of one variable in
order to establish this independence
condition let's this time try flipping
the value of B so we're going to have a
being false B being true and C being
true so if you look at the overall value
of the decision what now happens is that
B and C evaluates to true so it doesn't
matter that a is evaluates to false
overall decision evaluates to true this
time by flipping the value of only B
we've satisfied this condition for the
input B that is to say we've shown that
be independently affects the outcome
because when we change B the overall
value of the decision went from fall
- true so now let's see if we can do the
same thing for C so we're going to leave
a and B the same and we're going to pass
in C as false so now let's look what
happens B and C evaluates to false and
then also a is false so the entire value
of the boolean decision comes out to be
false so by only changing C and by
seeing that the overall decision change
value we've now shown that C
independently affects the outcome of the
decision and so what I believe we have
here is a minimal or if not minimal at
least fairly small set of test cases
that together gets 100% mc/dc coverage
for this particular conditional
statement in Python and you can see here
that this isn't a particularly
complicated conditional we could have
written one much more complicated and if
we had we probably would have had a
fairly hard time reasoning this stuff
out by hand and we what we need it would
have needed to do in that case is
probably draw out a full truth table and
so let's look at the idea behind mc/dc
coverage why would this be a good thing
at all what it's done is taken a
statement that was really very easy to
cover using either branch coverage or
statement coverage that is to say it's
pretty easy to take this and make it
either come out to be true or false
overall and we force testing of the
individual components of the boolean
logic and basically the idea is is the
one we have complicated boolean
expressions their truth tables become
rather large and what that means is
there's a lot of complexity hiding in
those truth tables when there's
complexity there are probably things we
don't understand and that means they're
probably bugs and it turns out that the
domain of interest for mc/dc coverage
that is to say embedded control systems
that happen to be embedded in avionics
systems end up having generally lots of
complicated conditionals it's definitely
desirable when people's lives depend on
the correctness of these complicated
conditional expressions to force people
to test them rather thoroughly the other
idea behind mc/dc coverage is that as
part of establishing that every
condition independently affects the
outcome of a decision we're going to
figure out when we have conditionals
that don't independently affect the
outcome of a decision and if you think
about it why would you have a
conditional involved in a conditional
expression which doesn't affect the
outcome what that basically means is
there's a programming mistake and it may
be a harmless mistake that is to say the
extra conditional being part of a
decision may not affect the correctness
of the overall system but what it means
is somebody didn't understand what was
going on and probably there's something
that we need to look at more closely and
probably even change and another thing
you can see looking at mc/dc coverage is
that getting it on a very large piece of
software it's going to take an enormous
amount of work and
is why it's a specialized coverage
metric for the avionics industry where
the critical parts of the codes end up
being fairly small so that's mc/dc
coverage and we're not going to take a
programming quiz on that since first of
all as you saw it gets to be a pain
pretty quickly and second we lack good
tool support for mc/dc coverage and
Python</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
