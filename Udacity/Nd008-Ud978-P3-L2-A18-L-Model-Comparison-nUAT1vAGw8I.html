models let's compare them side-by-side
using the model comparison tool yet
again so how we do this is we first
bring in a union tool and connect the
model objects from both their stepwise
and our decision tree models together
then what we do is we bring in our model
comparison tool where the Union model
objects go into the M or models side and
the validation data set goes into the D
or data side and just like in all of our
other models we're going to name what is
a positive class we want to have in that
target variable which is going to be vs
responses after this I'm going to bring
in a browser tool after this our output
and run the workflow what I'm expecting
as the results is to see exactly the
same thing in the model comparison tool
from our individual models but now side
by side and the whole reason I'm doing
that is is just easier to compare the
two different models against each other
side by side rather than looking at two
different windows so let's go examine
those outputs now so the first thing
like we did before is where a look at
that accuracy report and as you can see
the logistic plus stepwise model has a
two percent greater accuracy than the
decision tree model but let's look at
some of the other items that are found
within this report the confusion matrix
is the same as what we saw before so
we're going to skip over this part let's
go over to the games chart found in the
diagnostic plots so what the games chart
is showing me is the true response rate
on the y-axis as compared to the rate of
positive predictions so what I simply
look for is which of the two models the
quiz stepwise represent an orange are
the decision tree Redeemer represented
in blue reaches the top the quickest so
this is split into different deciles but
the only thing you really need to note
here is which model reaches the top the
quickest and which model is overall
highest the most and what I'm able to
see is that the stepwise model from the
regression is a little bit higher than
the decision tree model in this
experiment but as you can see there's
some different diagnostic plots found
within here such as a lift chart a
precision and recall curve at ROC curve
etc I'm not going to go in-depth on any
of these different types of diagnostic
plots but there are some notes to how to
interpret them and what they actually
might mean found in the reading notes
section what I typically take is just
the gains chart from this diagnostic
plots section but looking at all of this
the diagnostic plot the confusion matrix
the fidan error measures overall
accuracy it looks like we have two very
good models on our hands and evidence
shows that the logistic + stepwise model
performs slightly better in almost every
category and test therefore it is the
one that I would choose to predict who
is likely to redeem deals with future
