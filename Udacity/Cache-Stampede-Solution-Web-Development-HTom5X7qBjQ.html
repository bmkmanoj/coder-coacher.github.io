last one well let's go through the other
ones could we avoid a cache that pier by
replicating the database yeah in theory
but but it's it's it's not a very good
solution because as we said there's that
there's a cost to maintaining multiple
machines to running database queries
it's probably not the right approach but
it could work if you had enough
databases to handle all of the reading
you're doing only allow one request web
request at a time now this could kind of
sort of work but it means you know when
a request comes you basically queue up
all of the simultaneous requests that
you're receiving so that only one person
isn't only one person is hitting the
database at a time this could also work
in theory but then you've got to queue
up these users somewhere and it slows
down your site and it's generally
probably gonna be fairly painful only
allow one database request out of time
this is similar to what I just mentioned
we'd have to basically have all these
requests you know basically block or
wait on on one request that's actually
updating the cache or doing the query on
that sort of thing
you could either blot do it in your web
application which which would be tricky
or you can have some sort of lock in
your database either way
it's it's it's not going to work out as
well as you would like and finally you
know we just don't clear the cache
instead overwrite the cache with new
data so there's never this in-between
time between when we write to the
database and when we read from it again
where the cache is empty
make sure the cache is always always
full or warm you know basically we refer
to a cache hit as you know it's hit oh
it's hit a hot cache or a warm cache
that means the data is already in there
and this is a very simple approach and
this is what we'll go with let's go
ahead and implement this in ASCII Chan
okay so here we are in our ASCII Chan
code this is our line where we cleared
the cache we don't want to do this
anymore instead we want the cache to
just go ahead and update when we submit
a new new piece of art we're in our post
function for creating art so the way I'm
going to do it here is I'm going to make
a function I'm going to make this
function top arts take a parameter
called update and what this parameter is
going to signify is that if update is
false it's going to behave normally
but if update is true we're going to
update the cache we're never going to
read from the cache of update is true so
I'm gonna use that parameter here if not
update so basically if update is false
and the
key is in the cash return the cash
otherwise around the query so basically
if we set up date to true will always
run the query and then what we can do is
we can go down we don't need to change
our the reading this basically says
update false we don't to update the cash
every time we don't want to force that
update we want to go down here instead
of calling cash clear we want to say top
arts true this is going to rerun the
query and update the cash so that means
the user who does the submitting
triggers the rerunning of the front page
query and any users who are reading at
the same time who are loading the front
page at the same time won't ever hit the
database that means a page view will
never hit the database that's a very
good quality to have let's go ahead and
make sure things still work so I reload
the page everything still works I look
at the terminal we see that there was a
DB query that we just ran reload the
page again we see that there's no
database query now let's go ahead and
submit a new piece of art okay I'm I
submit a new piece of art this is of the
Linux penguin tux
now when I submit this what's happening
is we're inserting the new piece of art
into the database and updating the cache
now we can see that the the redirect the
page reload worked and in our little tux
was in fact submitted and we go to our
terminal we look at what happened we can
see the start of a query we've got this
this little error message from when we
looked up the IP from that feature we
had last week we can see that in our
console we're printing DB query in the
post request this these log lines aren't
written until after the request is
finished so we're writing tux to the
database then we're reading the database
to get the most recent the 10 most
recent items and then we're redirecting
the user that's the 302 and then on our
next front page request to get slash
there was no database right so that
means we're still doing the same number
of database reads as we were doing
before if the other solution except the
database read is triggered on submission
and not on page load which has a really
nice property and that there's no
database read for the the front page
load ever unless the cache is completely
empty</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
