and its larger context as part of the
software process but I'd like to talk
about now is one of the more advanced
and frankly difficult parts of building
a really good random test case generator
so as I was saying a little while ago
the best way to start random testing is
started early in the software process
and start simple and what's going to
come out of a simple random test case
generator is often a collection of
testing results that are not
particularly great it is to say we get
shallow coverage we violate many
constraints on valid inputs and overall
it doesn't work all that well and
probably doesn't find all that many bugs
unless we're testing a particularly weak
system like for example the UNIX command
line utilities from around 1990 so the
thing to do with these results look hard
at the test cases think hard about how
they relate to the overall shape of the
input domain for the system so for
example it may be that we're generating
a superset of the input domain that is
to say we're generating invalid inputs
but it's also likely that in many cases
we're generating a subset of the domain
that is to say we're generating test
cases that fail to explore some parts of
the behavior space of the software under
test and that's going to lead to mist
bugs you should definitely look at the
effect that the random test cases have
on code coverage often this is extremely
revealing because as we've seen it's
really easy to write a random test case
generator it gets very shallow coverage
of the software under test the next step
use what you've learned to adjust the
rules that are in effect for generating
random test cases and to tweak the
probabilities if that sounds very vague
at this point then that's good because
it is very vague and what I'm going to
do in a little bit is going to some
specific examples of course we can also
add functionality to our random tester
and as I was saying earlier it's often
good to do this in a very slow and
incremental fashion so we avoid
overloading people with bugs that they
don't have time to fixed and this is an
iterative process that doesn't stop as
long as we're using the random tester we
should sort of kind of always keep
looking at it and trying to evaluate how
we can better adjust the random tester
to find interesting things out about the
software testing and I don't mean to say
here that this has to take a lot of time
something you do is just anytime you
have time every couple of weeks or
however or whenever just take a look at
the test cases take a look at the
coverage think about things a little bit
see if anything has changed in the
software under test that might make you
want to tweak the random tester and then
basically you just put it back into
production</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
