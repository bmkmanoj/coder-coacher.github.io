van procedure to input a parameter
vector of three parameters and for
reasons that we obviously Durai have a
print flag that are default to false I
have the same initial parameters as
before speed an error acrostic error
into the crosstrack error I said my
drift parameter and to make it a little
bit more obvious how what the effect of
parameter selection has on my error
IELTS said the total number iterations
to n times two and when I count the
total cross deck error down here I only
counted from step n on so I give the
algorithm a chance to converge to zero
for n steps where I don't count the
cross the error but I'd like to know how
the cross error
valves quadratically from step 101 on to
200 if the print flag is set I set the
output here in degrees and on radians
and I return my average error the float
value so I want you to write the routine
twiddle and the routine should find the
optimum s and return them to me so I
want you to implement twiddle with a
tolerance and threshold of 0.001 when I
run twiddle it shows the parameters over
time and the crosstrack error and this
cross type error very quickly goes to
zero in fact after a few iterations 107
in my implementation you get a
crosstrack error of three point six one
one to the minus 17th and here's a
typical control run you see my X my Y my
orientation my drift is constant that's
much constant references and in the
beginning the arrow is 195 on average
but after a short amount of time you'll
find that my Y error goes down to ten to
the minus six and stays there which
means our controller is really really
good and tracking our desired location
in our final control error between time
step 100 and 200 is three point six one
one so I wanted to implement twiddle we
might change something on the robot
setup but when you run it it will be
such that if you run a full PID
controller and find the upper parameters
that the final control error will be
really really small and therefore we
will be checking</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
