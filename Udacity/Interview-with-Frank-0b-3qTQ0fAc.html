use update children instead of lots of
set value instructions I'm guessing it
has something to do with data
consistency Frank city was just talking
with somebody else about consistency
issues want to see if I can find him yes
but I've got a doctor's appointment to
check out the medical side effects of
truth seeing amulets hmm the developers
free though yeah you should come over
want to take the company sailboat hello
and welcome i'm here with puff an
engineer on the firebase team and we're
here to talk about how to keep data
consistent firebase yeah that's gonna be
fun so puff I get how you doin ishal
design but how do you ensure that your
data can remain scalable afterwards yeah
that's a good question is always always
tricky right when we do the initial data
design a lots of software engineers our
database modelers by education so we try
to minimize the duplication of data we
go through all our database
normalization forums and and and then we
notice things don't don't scale up very
well and we need to start d normalizing
a bit so in firebase that that pretty
much comes in we have in in the form of
duplicating data so instead of having
one place where you store it a bit of
data you actually store it in every
place where you might need it so if you
have a chat application for example you
have a list of messages in a list of
users and every message belongs to one
user so it's very very natural to want
to just store the ID of the user and
look to user up but that means that
every time you need to display a message
you need to look up the user that the
message belongs to and it might be
easier to actually store the minimal
information you need to display for you
i like the user name next to every chat
message because then if you want to show
a list of check messages you just load
the messages and you don't need to do
look up yet so that's a very common
thing we see in this this is a data
duplication it's not very natural but
it's how you can keep your data scalable
but would you explain what atomic
updates are versus the opposite serve
yeah method yeah sure so the scenario we
just had where you have a chat room and
you have to use or separately but you
keep the name of every user with the
message that they post and let's say
that the user wants to change their name
right so the first thing you need to do
is that you update the user name in
there user profile but then you need to
loop through all check messages and
update the names there so the simple way
of doing this is actually write your
first update or set value on the user
profile and then you find all the
messages that they have and you loop
through them and update them one by one
that works great the problem with it is
that if somewhere in the middle the user
closes the Android app then you have
yeah there will be no more updates being
sent and you have half of the messages
of data than the other half won't be and
that's what atomic updates solve so with
atomic updates we built the entire both
this changing of the name and defending
their data out into every chat message
we put that in a single command to the
firebase database so that command can be
can be pretty big but it's it's either
going to completely succeed or it's not
going to happen at all so and this is
very beneficial if you're updating a
duplicated data so what are the major
ways that people keep data denormalized
in the world of firebase it's mostly
about duplicating day town so I often
tell people to to model screens in their
in their firebase so the information
that you need in the screen try to get
that into into one location or as few
locations as possible in the in the
database and so that's what we had
before with the chat application right
where you store the user name with each
message even though you also have their
name in the profile and you will see
this quite often so we see people if
you're having a list of bank
transactions for example you might want
to duplicate the credit card information
for every bank transaction so this is
one where we see it quite often too and
essentially there are all variations on
the same theme where you duplicate the
data into into multiple places so that
you only have to read fewer free
locations so pop are there any times
when you can't use atomic updates um
yeah there are so atomic updates right
the the update either makes it to the
firebase database or it doesn't so
there's no inconsistent state that you
can have we have one other way of doing
that that's when you use a transaction
and atomic updates and transactions they
are sort of similar although they are
completely different ap is and why you'd
want to use in transaction is if you
also want to get the previous value in
there an atomic update can write to
multiple locations but you don't know
the current value on any of the
locations if you need to know the
current value for example if you are
going to increase a counter or or keep
the balance of an accounts then you need
to still use the transaction you can't
use it to make updates so I just want to
make sure on this one puff and just make
sure our developer really understands
this one are there any other limits to
atomic updates that we should know about
not that's not atomic updates per se one
of the things I think in the end of
course we focused a lot on using atomic
updates from the android client and they
work great there but as you are updating
more data your your update command the
network traffic will get bigger so
there's a certain limit where it's it's
not a good idea to do this from a client
anymore if you're building a social a
social media app then if a user on your
app has a million followers then
probably you don't want to write all the
duplicate data from an Android device
because it just becomes too much too
much data that you're sending so in that
case you most likely want to do still
use the atomic updates but you want to
use them from a server it's still the
same mechanism you still use the same
API but you're moving it off of the
client device to a environment where you
have probably better network
connectivity and more memory available
that make sense no pop thanks very much
for your time really appreciate your
help sure you're welcome I think it's
gonna really help our developer out cool
that's why we're here alright thanks a
lot sure alright Cheers let's hit the
pool okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
