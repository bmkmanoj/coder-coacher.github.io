with the context of authentication that
establishes the source and the idea that
this authorization check or access
control check has to happen if the
resources have to be protected really
for us to be able to answer this
question we had whether in a request
should be granted or denied we have to
know who is allowed to access what
resources in a given system so if you
think about this there are really two
parts to this problem or the way we're
going to address this problem in part
one someone has to specify who has
access to what so this is called an
access control policy so there may be
many ways to sort of decide who gets to
access what there has to be a policy we
have in place that is going to define
this for us so answer this question
about who can access what is you tell
the system how the resources should be
shared or who should be given access to
what resource once you do that then it's
the part two is about enforcement the
system has to monitor each request for
these resources and based on the policy
that tells us who can access what it
should make sure that any accesses that
are allowed are consistent with the
policy that we have so enforcement
basically says there is no way for you
to go and access a resource when that
access is not allowed by the policy so
define the policy that's in part one and
then enforce the policy that's part 2
now you can see the importance of
complete mediation clearly complete
mediation said no one should be able to
bypass and get to the resource without
going through the trusted computing base
if you don't have complete mediation we
can't perform this check access control
check that we are talking about that is
possible only when the trusted computing
base is involved in a request and that's
why complete mediation it's so important</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
