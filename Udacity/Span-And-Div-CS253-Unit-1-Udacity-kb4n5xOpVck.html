these are called span and div span and
div are both normal elements they can
both have content and the only
difference between these two is span is
in line and div is block will play
around with these in the editor a little
bit but these are basically these these
elements don't do anything other than
just contain their content and there's a
way to attach styles to them to adjust
different behaviors of how they display
that looks something like this so you
can see I've added two attributes or an
attribute to each of these called class
and this is a CSS class and this is not
something we're going to spend a whole
lot of time on in this course I'll
provide most of the CSS but it's a
separate language for adding styles to
your documents or changing the changing
how different text looks and we'll be
using spans and divs a lot for you know
controlling how text is laid out but the
important thing to remember is that
spans are in line and divs or block
let's play around with these on the
browser a little bit real quick so you
can see what I'm talking about okay so
we've got our texts and our first line
is wrapped in span and it behaves as as
we would expect an inline element to
behave now if I were to change the span
to a div it behaves more like how the
paragraph tag before behaved this div is
actually this creates a box around this
piece of text and you can see my we
actually did something interesting I
added a little period after the div and
the period appears down on the second
line here what I'd like you to do is
check all the elements that are in line
some of these elements you haven't seen
before so I would like you to try them
out in your own browser and figure it
out for yourself</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
