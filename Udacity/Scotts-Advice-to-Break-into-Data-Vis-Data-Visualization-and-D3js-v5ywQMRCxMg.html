I want you to hear from Scott Murray
again Scott has some excellent advice
for breaking into the field if you could
go back and sort of give yourself advice
from when you first started in the field
when you first started making data
visualizations what advice would that be
my advice would be to just find topics
I'm really excited about and go pursue
them which I sort of did but secondly to
get that stuff published and out on the
web and start sharing it like sooner um
I know with sort of my personal
experience there's this feeling that
well I I can't put something out into
the world until it's like polished and
finished and perfect and really exciting
or amazing I know students get that a
lot to its can be really intimidating
especially if you're studying works by
people who are doing you know at least
on paper having all kinds of a success
and like doing these amazing projects
can be really intimidating to be like oh
here's this little chart I made or hears
this you know thing that so feel so
insignificant or might have problems but
I think really that's how you get
established in this probably in a lot of
fields but especially in this field
where it's all about kind of sharing and
this visual communication and then
having people respond to that graphic
because the graphics are not just kind
of end points so the visualizations
aren't just end points but they're
really sort of starting points for the
rest of the conversation so one thing
this is especially true i guess for
design students as you know it's like
you have to have a web-based portfolio
you have to have something on the web
where you can publish things and get it
out there and like engage people and get
a response so i would say you know start
making stuff as quick as you can and
start putting it out there as quick as
you can and certainly like engaging with
other practitioners and you know
critiquing in a helpful way so try and
turn it up the fraught provide helpful
advice and not just it's kind of too
easy to cut down the things that aren't
very good like there's been some
discussion kind of
munity about this recently on what's the
value of critique and what kind of
critique is helpful somebody uses you
know quote unquote bad colors it's very
easy to be like oh oh those are you know
horrible colors that makes it too hard
to read or something instead of saying
those are horrible colors say you know
maybe this is somebody new who's coming
in and they're trying to learn how to do
a good job encourage them with hey why
don't can I suggest these better colors
or can I suggest this other visual
representation so I think part of it is
you're getting your stuff out there but
it's also being friendly and supportive
and you know hopefully kind and
empathizing with the people who are new
we're just coming in</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
