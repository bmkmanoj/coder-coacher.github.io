remote object class that's available in
the Java distributed object model as
before the developer writes a bank
account object providing the methods for
deposit withdrawn balance and publishes
the methods that are in their object
using the remote interface so that this
banker code interface now becomes
available for any client that wants to
access that object and the reason this
interface becomes available to the
client is because you're extending this
remote interface class that's available
in the distributed object model of Java
however note how the bank account
implementation is actually derived it is
derived from the Java built-in classes
for remote object and remote server so
you extend the remote object and the
remote server in order to get this bank
account implementation object now when
you have derived your bank account
implementation object from the built-in
distributed object model of Java namely
the remote object and the remote server
classes now when you instantiate your
bank account implementation object it
becomes instantly visible to the network
clients you don't have to do any of the
heavy lifting so once the public methods
for the bank account implementation are
written by inheriting these milton
classes of Java all the way starting
from the remote interface remote object
and the remote server when the bank
account implementation object is
instantiated the server becomes
instantly visible magically visible to
remote clients through the Java Runtime
system that's the power of the
distributed object model of Java so the
second choice of reusing remote object
class in order to derive this
implementation results in the heavy
lifting being done by the Java magic so
all of the heavy lifting needed to make
this bank account implementation object
visible to network clients is being done
by the Java Runtime now that I've given
you the difference between the two
choices
one using remote interface and the other
deriving your object from the remote
object on the remote server time for a
quiz</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
