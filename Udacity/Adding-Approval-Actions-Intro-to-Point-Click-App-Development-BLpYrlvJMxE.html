process and if I scroll down so I've got
these submission Ischl submission
actions approval steps final approval
actions final rejection actions all
these different things what's what's
going on here
so actions and approvals are the same
thing as they aren't workflows you know
creating an email or sending an email
creating a task updating a field but the
great thing about approval process is
you can add in actions throughout all
the steps of the process so initial
submission actions are the actions that
are fired immediately after someone
submits a record for approval the
approval steps are the pieces of the
flow that you know happen as it's going
down the line of approvers because you
could have one approver just one manager
or you could send it down a list of
managers if you wanted a bunch of people
to approve it then there's the final
approval actions which is after either
the last person approves it rejects it
or maybe somewhere along the way someone
was like recall this approval like I
want to take it back okay and so you can
set up actions for all those parts of
the flow very cool okay that makes sense</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
