import the extension to the play sounds
view controller we're on the final step
to getting pitch perfect to play back
the audio let me walk you through what
we need to set up if you think back to
earlier in this lesson we wired up all
six sound effect buttons to call the
play sound for button function what we
need now is a way to distinguish between
each of these buttons and then call the
appropriate function in our extension to
play that sound effect there are several
ways to distinguish one UI button from
another but the easiest is using the tag
property of the button this is just an
integer value we can assign the UI
button and then later query in the play
sound for button function with a button
selected in the attributes inspector
open you can scroll down to the view
section and see the tag here on the
bottom right the default tag value is 0
therefore all of our UI buttons have 0
as your tag value time to change that
the snail button is the first button so
we can have a tag of 0 but we should
change it for the other five buttons
open the main nuts storyboard and select
the play sounds view controller seen as
I've done here select the rabbit button
scroll down to the tag and set it to one
now select the chipmunk button and then
the attributes inspector set the tag to
24 the Darth Vader button set the tag 23
for the echo button set the tag to four
finally for the reverb button set the
tag to five now we have different tag
values for each playback button from 0
to 5 the next step is to change the
place sound for button function so that
does a different audio playback
depending on what button was pressed
let's go to that function and the play
sounds view controller that's with file
to make more space we can use command
option 0 to close the right side
remember the enumeration you added
earlier here for values from 0 to 5 we
can use them in a switch statement to
call the play sound function differently
for each of the buttons add the code for
the switch statement so that it appears
as you can see here if the slow or fast
button is pressed we'll play the sound
at a different rate if the chipmunk or
Darth Vader voices are selected will
alter the pitch
if echo or reverb sound effects are
selected will pass those settings onward
to the play sound function while playing
audio is great it would be nice for you
stop playback when we want to we do have
a stop button and it's already wired up
to call the stop button press function
in our place sounds view controller all
we need to do is to add a call to the
stop audio function that is in the class
extension and they will do the work of
calling out to av audio engine to stop
the playback if you follow along to this
point we should be able to test the
pitch perfect app you should be able to
record yourself and hear the playback
with a variety of sound effects let's
try it Swift is great in the very short
amount of time you got pitch perfect
built from the ground up a fun iOS app
that can record and playback audio with
sound effects if you're curious about
the calls to av audio engine I'm going
to go over that next for now pat
yourself on the back you are already an
iOS developer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
