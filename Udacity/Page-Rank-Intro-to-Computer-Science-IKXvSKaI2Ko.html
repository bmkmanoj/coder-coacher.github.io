is the same idea as how we measured
popularity of people but instead of
thinking about friendships as the way to
measure popularity what we're measuring
is links on the web when one page has a
link to another page will that indicate
it's more likely that this other page is
popular just like when someone is a
friend
it indicates the person they're friends
with is more likely to be popular so the
goal in ranking web pages is to get a
measure of how popular pages based on
the other pages that link to it but we
have the same issue with popularity that
not all links are the same that a link
from a page that's really important
counts for a lot more than a link from a
page that is not important so if the New
York Times has a link to your page that
counts for a lot more than if your mom
sets up a web page and puts a link to
your page in it unless your mom is Lady
gaga
in which case her link probably counts
for more so another way of thinking
about this is what we're trying to model
is a random web surfer so our random web
surfer has some set of pages that they
know about and those pages have links to
other pages some pages might have a lot
of links some pages might just have one
link some pages might have no links so
one way to think about this is that
we're trying to model a random web
surfer the web surfers starts knowing
about some pages and she picks one page
at random let's say she picks this page
and then when she's on that page she
picks a random link and follow that link
oops this was a bad starting page it
actually has no out links so then she
picks another random page let's say she
picks this one she follows the link from
that page and now she got to the page
with no links again let's say she picked
a better starting point let's say she
randomly picked this one now she's got
two links to fall she randomly picks one
of those she follows it she gets to a
new page she randomly picks a link from
that page in this case it only had one
and in this case it seems we have a bit
of a problem because all of the starting
pages eventually lead into this one
which has no outgoing links so we'll
think about how to solve that problem
later but we can think of what our
random web surfer is doing is picking
random pages following links and what we
want to measure is the popularity of a
page and that's the probability that she
reaches that given page starting from
these random pages so if you did this
over and over again and you counted the
number of times you reach each page that
will give you a measure of that pages
popularity so this is very similar to
the popularity function we're going to
define a function that will call the
rank of a page and like the way we
define the popularity function it's
going to have two inputs it's going to
have a time step and it's going to have
the page which will use a URL for and
the output of rank will be some number
except for will define for time step
zero this is our base case we're going
to find all the Rings have value one
will actually change that shortly but
we'll start out think about all the
ranks having value 1 like we did with
the popularity scores and then we'll
define the value of the rank at time
step T for any given URL just like we
define the popularity score it's going
to be the sum of all the pages that are
friends with this page and what it means
for a web page to be friends with
another page is that it has a link to it
so this is going to be for all the pages
that exist that have some link to that
URL or its friends and so we're going to
go through each of those pages we'll
call them in links instead of friends
we're going to go through those and
we're going to sum up the ranks that we
got for those pages at time t minus 1 so
this is our first model of popularity on
of web pages this is exactly the same as
the model we had of popularity for
people it's not going to work that well
yet and one of the reasons it's not
going to work that well is some pages
might have lots of links and if the page
has lots of links the value of each one
of its links should be diminished it
shouldn't have the same value as a page
that only has one link that links to
this URL maybe that should be the same
case for friend popularity if someone
has lots of friends each friend is less
valued whereas someone who only is a
small number of friends has lots of time
for each friend so this is the way we're
going to model web popularity that we
don't want to just give
same score to each link we're going to
change this by dividing by the number of
out links so if a page has many outgoing
links the value to the pages that links
to is less for each page so a page
that's just a long list of lots of links
won't have that much influence on the
rankings if a page only has a few
outgoing links well then they're worth
more so what we're going to do is divide
this by the number of out links from P
so each of the P pages right these will
be the value of P as we go through the
in links of URL we're going to sum up
the rank that we got on the previous
time step and divide that by the number
of out links</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
