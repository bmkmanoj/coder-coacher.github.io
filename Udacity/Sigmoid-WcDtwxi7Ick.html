at a function called the sigmoid sigmoid
meaning s like write sig Sigma ish
sigmoid so we're going to find this this
the sigmoid using the letter Sigma
defined it's going to be applied to the
activation just like we were doing
before but instead of thresholded at 0
what it's instead going to do is compute
this function of a 1 over 1 plus e to
the e to the minus a and what do we know
about this function well it is ought to
be clear that as the activation gets
less and less and less we'd want it to
go to 0 and in fact it does right so as
a goes to negative infinity the negative
a goes to infinity e to the infinity is
something really really big so it's 1
over 1 plus something really big which
is like 1 over something huge which is
almost zero so the sigmoid function goes
toward this function that we defined
here goes to 0 as the activation goes to
negative infinity that's great that's
just like the threshold and as the
activation gets really really large
we're talking about e to the minus
something really large which is like e
to the almost or like e to the negative
infinity which is like almost zero so 1
over 1 plus 0 is essentially 1 so on the
1 limit it goes towards zero and the
other limit it goes towards 1 and in
fact we can just draw this so you can
see what it really looks like you know
minus 5 and below it's essentially at
zero and then it makes this kind of
gradual you can see why it's sigmoid
rights s-shaped curve then it comes back
up to the top and it's basically at 1 by
the time we get to 5 so instead of just
an abrupt transition at 0 we have this
gradual transition between negative 5 &amp;amp;
5 and this is great because it's
differentiable so what you think charles
is this set to answer your question
those by the alright good so if we have
units like this now we can take
derivatives which means we can use this
gradient descent idea all over the place
so not only is this function
differentiable but the derivative itself
has a very beautiful form in particular
it turns out that if you take the
derivative of this Sigma function it can
be written as the function itself times
1 minus the function itself so this is
just this is just really elegant and
simple so if you have
Sigma function in your code there's
nothing special that you need for the
derivative you can just compute it this
way so we would it's it's not a bad
exercise to go through and do this and
practice your calculus we just we just
did this together but it's not that fun
to watch so I would suggest doing it on
your own if you have any trouble we'll
provide additional information for you
to help you work that out but when you
do it on your own make certain no one's
watching well they can watch they just
probably won't enjoy it very much so so
can we say anything about why this form
kind of makes sense so so what's neat
about this is as we as our activation
gets very very negative then our Sigma
value gets closer and closer to zero and
if you look at what our derivative is
there it's something like zero times
something like one minus zero whereas
the derivative as you get to very very
large A's
that's like Sigma is going to 1 and you
get 1 times 1 minus 2 1 minus 1 so
essentially 1 times 0 so you can see the
derivatives flattened out for very large
and very negative A's and when a is like
zero so what happens when a is like zero
well what does happen when a is like
zero charles what happens if we plug 0
into this Sigma function you want to
have is that obvious oh I see because e
to the minus a that's zero so e to the
zero is 1 1 over 1 plus 1 so 1/2 and
then our derivative at that point is 1/2
times 1/2 or 1/4 that's kind of neat mmm
so so this is really this it's it's in a
very nice form for being able to work
with it but it's probably we're saying
that surely you could use other
functions that are differentiable and
there might be good reasons to do that
this one just happens to be a very nice
way of dealing with the threshold and
then are also nice so again the main
properties here are that it as
activation gets very negative it goes to
zero as activation gets very positive it
goes to 1 and there's this smooth
transition in between and there's you
know other ways of making that shape</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
