use these primitives in building a
subsystem the first part of the code is
going to be the initialization portion
where the developer is mapping the
address space of his process to external
segments chosen regions of the address
space to external data segments and also
specifying what the log segment is going
to be for this particular code base that
he or she is writing and in the body of
the code they're going to be regions
where they want to manipulate persistent
data structures and for that portion of
the code they're going to say begin
transaction end transaction and within
that the first thing they would do is
set the range to indicate what is the
block of contiguous addresses that they
plan to modify in this critical section
and of course this block of addresses
should be contained in the range that
has been mapped to an external data
segments and once they have done that
then the rest of the code is normal code
that they write in terms of manipulating
data structures so they may be writing
to a data structure m1 which is really a
metadata that needs to be persisted and
if that is the case it is important that
the user ensure that this data structure
m1 is contained in the range that they
specified at the beginning and similarly
m2 if it is another persistent data
structure that they're modifying it
better be contained in the range again
that they set out in the beginning and
finally when they are done with all the
changes and they want to commit they can
call em transaction and at that point
all the changes that they made to these
data structures are going to be written
as a redo log into the log segment so
the first thing that l r vm would do
inside this transaction code is when you
execute the set range call it says AHA
this is the portion of the address range
that the developer is going to modify
within this critical section and it is
possible that this transaction which is
beginning now may
commit or abort if in fact the board's
then I have to make sure that all the
changes that are made to persistent data
structures are thrown away at the point
of a board and therefore the first thing
that L rvm does is create what is called
an undo record which is really a copy of
the virtual address space starting at
this base address for this number of
bytes that's the portion of the address
space that the developer intends to
modify within this critical section so
lr vm makes an undo record which is the
original version of that portion of the
address space so this undo record is an
in-memory copy of the virtual address
space starting here for some number of
bytes specified by this number of bytes
and this is a temporary record and in
fact lr vm would create this undo record
only if it is needed by this transaction
semantics in the begin transaction there
is a mode specifier that the user can
specify to the rvm whether this
particular transaction is going to ever
abort so in other words if the developer
is absolutely certain that his
transaction is never going to abort then
he can specify a no restore mode for
this transaction which tells our VM that
look this transaction is never going to
abort and therefore no need for you to
create an undo record that's the intent
of that so again we want to make sure
that these primitives are performant
this is one of the ways by which the
application developer can make sure that
lr vm does not do unnecessary work and
in this case if this transaction is
never going to abort then there is no
reason to create an under record so
that's the idea behind the low restore
mode in the begin transaction in any
event if the transaction eventually
commits at that point lr vm will throw
away the sun to record this undo record
is meaningful only if the transaction
aborts because in that case what lr vm
would do is restore the original version
of the
portion of the virtual address space by
copying the undo record back into that
space so during the body of this
critical section when the application is
modifying this in memory version of
persistent data structure no action by
lr VN all these changes are happening
directly to the virtual address space of
that particular process exactly where
this in memory copy of persistent data
structures are living</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
