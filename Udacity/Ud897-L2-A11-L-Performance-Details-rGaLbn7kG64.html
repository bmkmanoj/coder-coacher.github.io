nature of the web and network
architecture in this example over fifty
percent of the time from pressing enter
in the address bar to the page being
displayed is spent waiting for the
answer this waiting period is called
time to first byte or TTFN be if this
website need to grab additional
resources we would have to wait for the
response of our first request before we
could send out a second request that in
turn means that we have another period
of time waiting that is not being used
effectively this problem is called head
of line blocking let's see an example of
what head of line blocking is and how it
is bad for the user experience with HTTP
a connection is like a queue while the
first request is being handled all other
requests have to wait until it is their
turn a lot of time is being wasted here
alright one medium coffee enjoy hey can
I order a drink now yeah well yeah okay
great I like a venti half whole milk one
quarter one percent one quarter nonfat
extra hot split quad shot one half shots
decaf two and a half shots regular no
foam latte with whip two packets of
Splenda one sugar in the raw a touch of
vanilla syrup and three short sprinkles
of cinnamon and I'm kind of in a hurry
Thanks okay good while the richest drink
is being prepared the other customers
are left waiting even though their
request would be much faster to make the
head of line is blocking the rest of the
customers to counteract with limitation
a little bit browsers open up to six
parallel connections or in our coverage
of comparison they hire another barista
so while the first connection is waiting
for its first bite a second request can
already be sent on the second connection
and so on of course hiring a new barista
takes off time and training in the
browser opening all these connections is
also quite costly because of the gcp
handshakes necessary the six parallel
connections browsers can make is still
only a band-aid for the head of line
blocking if you have a lot of resources
on your page you will spend most of your
time waiting or staring at the cashier
head of line blocking is a huge
bottleneck to website performance browse
is being able to open up six
parallel connections help but it's not
great later we'll see how HTTP two fixes
issues with head of line blocking</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
