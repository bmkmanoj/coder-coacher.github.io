more on Kate's family pedigree of
lactose intolerance and hopefully you
realize now we're looking at a pedigree
for a recessive trait this is what a
recessive pedigree looks like and let's
see if we can write down a couple of
things that we definitely know from the
pedigree remember we might switch back
and forth between using these two
different types of symbols the thymine
cytosine DNA letter alleles versus the
plus minus symbols indicating lactase
persistence on the top and lactase non
persistence on the bottom now in our
pedigree we know that everybody who's
affected is shaded in and they must be
recessive homozygous recessive every
individual that shaded in on this
pedigree must be minus minus or CC based
on what we've learned so far we know
this must be true now let's take a look
at Kate's parents here kate is affected
we know she's minus- each parent had to
give her one of their own alleles this
means one of her minuses had to come
from mom and one of her minuses had to
come from dad but the question is what's
the other allele and we already know the
answer mom and dad are unaffected if mom
and dad are unaffected that means their
other allele has to be a plus because if
it was a minus then both mom and dad
would also be affected and you'd see
them shaded in as well but they're not
we know they're not affected this
information about the trait has been
able to inform us about what their
possible genotype is this is what makes
pedigree so amazing we know immediately
what Kate's genotype must be we know
what her parents genotypes must be but
now let's look at her brother we know
her brother's not affected so he could
be either plus plus or plus minus and
actually the problem here is all we know
is that he has one plus he could be plus
plus right he could have gotten a plus
from each parent or he could have gotten
a plus from one parent and a minus from
another parent we don't know so that's
actually still an unknown variable for
us right now it's something we can't
determine from the pedigree this is one
of our limits now there's another really
amazing pattern that this pedigree
reveals to us we learned earlier that
the tray
itself of lactose intolerance skips
generations Kate's maternal grandfather
is affected by lactose intolerance her
mother is not but then Kate is the trait
skipped a generation but now look at the
genotypes we know her grandfather must
be minus minus her mother must be minus
plus and she is also minus minus that
minus allele traveled from her
grandfather to her mother to her so
although her mother doesn't show the
trait one of the alleles that
contributes to the trait that Kate has
was passed from her grandfather to her
mother to her so for recessive trait
like lactose intolerance using the
information from the pedigree that we've
been discussing which of the following
items are true this can be a very tricky
problem I do not want you to be
intimidated but I do want you to take
your time and think about it these are
checkboxes which means there are lots of
possible combinations here I want you to
see if you can figure out which of these
items are true and check any and all
boxes that you think apply now if you
get frustrated don't worry go to the
discussion forum see if you can get some
other hints about how to figure this out
and if you really think it will be
helpful go ahead and skip ahead to the
solution video but please please try and
think about this one and answer it on
your own first</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
