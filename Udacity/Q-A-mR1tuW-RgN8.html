listed in the sidebar all the time
should the list of locations depend on
the user input or should my model have
my locations and that is that okay good
question so that so the list view should
have all the locations when nothing's
been searched for yet when you begin
searching for something that's when the
the list view begins filtering yeah so
the list of locations will depend on
what the users searching for so like in
my example when I search sushi it
filtered out all the restaurants that
didn't have sushi either in the name or
you can also maybe get creative and add
like categories for all your places and
you can filter through the categories as
well but yeah whatever you're searching
for that's the only thing that should
show up in the list view so your list
view right is getting information from
your model your search is basically
looking through your model to figure out
what to turn on and off and your map is
looking at your model to decide where to
put markers so the model is kind of
control I shouldn't say controlling the
models kind of what's deciding what gets
populated into everything and what
everything's sort of filtering through
it's more like Oh what are the data that
is required for my application so the
model decides your content of the
application so list is a chosen subset
of model and markers are a matching
subset of model there the list in the
markers should be the same subset of the
model so when I search for something my
markers are reflecting that search as
well as my list view so anything that
disappears of my list view is also
disappearing on my markers and to think
of it like if you had a google map and
ahead of markers you search for
restaurant and it gave you all the
markers all the restaurants
right and then you search for burger
restaurant and then like half of those
markers would go away and they're just
be the burger restaurants left and then
right on your list view you'd have a big
list of restaurants and then when you
you know major filter a little bit
stronger and put it like burger
restaurant that would filter down as
well yeah so to follow her question so
she asked and both are set by the search
yes actually your list and your markers
are set by your search function whatever
you search has to show up on your list
has to reflect on your markers as well
um the result of your search function
and sometimes the list might have one or
two things listed and other times 10 or
15 depending on the search exactly
that's right when you're not searching
for anything you can show all the places
that um have you know that you have
actually displayed in your map when
you're searching for something you might
filter that list into a subset of you
know whatever the key word or the
character that you're entering and this
should reflect in your markers as well
in addition to knock up can we use
jQuery UI widgets such as the
autocomplete widget uh yeah you can feel
free to use the jQuery UI widgets just
make sure that you kind of understand
what's going on with like what the out
of complete widget is actually doing
because it can get a little tricky when
there's some functionality built into it
that you don't really know about but I
don't see any problem with using using
those along with knockout but we do
require that you use knockout so try not
to rely too much on sort of pre-built
widgets and things like that yeah yeah
you can actually and it's actually
really really simple fortunately chrome
makes debugging and testing all aspects
of your site really easily if you
actually go into your developer tools
there's a little emulator icon and in
here you can emulate like a bunch of
different devices so this is a great
place to test things
like responsiveness and making sure it
displays well on different devices and
chrome is usually pretty good about
making sure these devices are up to date
but next to this sort of device tab is
also a network tab and in here there's
all sorts of options so I can sort of
test how my website is going to load on
tons of different sort of connection
speeds and one of them happens to be
offline so if I wanted to test you know
what it what happens if my website is
trying to be accessed offline well you
know I can refresh and see like oh god
nothing loads because I'm offline and
I'm trying to reach Google Maps or I can
test it on Wi-Fi and see everything
loads really quickly you can also do
other kinds of throttling like just
testing it on your your local connection
in good regular dial-up whatever so this
is a really cool suite of tools that
chrome has developed for us</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
