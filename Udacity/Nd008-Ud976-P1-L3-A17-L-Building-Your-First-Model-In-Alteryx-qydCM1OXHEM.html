download the linear example data excel
file Microsoft Excel and Google sheets
are not able to easily handle categories
with linear regression so we're going to
use a more sophisticated software
program called Alteryx for this example
and much of the future courses there's a
brief overview of Alteryx below the
video note there are techniques that you
can use to leverage spreadsheets to
handle categories with linear regression
but we won't review these techniques in
this course first let's open up all
tracks now drag an input data tool from
the toolbar onto the canvas click on the
drop down arrow in the configuration
panel and select file browse navigate to
where you save the linear example data
excel file and select it and then select
open since the data is coming from an
Excel document a window will pop up
asking you to choose the sheet that you
want to read in this case there is only
one sheet labeled data select data and
then click the ok button note if you
have the document open in Excel you'll
get an error in Alteryx saying that the
document is already in use by another
process you'll need to close the
document in Excel before you open it in
Alteryx
if you click on the input tool you'll
see the configuration that window on the
left side of the screen along with the
preview of the data now that we have the
data selected to be brought into Alteryx
we can grab a linear regression tool
from the predictive tools category and
drag it into the canvas next to the
input data tool in the configuration
panel we can set up a linear regression
working our way down the configuration
steps let's name our model I'm going to
name mine example reg now select the
drop-down that is labeled to select the
target variable this will list all the
variables that could be the target
variable for the linear regression in
alphabetical order remember that a
linear regression has to have a numeric
target variable so only number fields
will be displayed in this list select
the column called
average number of tickets because this
is the variable we're looking to predict
in the next box which is labeled select
the predictor variables there are a list
of variables that could be used as
predictor variables in the analysis with
a checkbox next to each of them to
include a variable as a predictor
variable and then
analysis simply select the checkbox next
to the variable select the variables
number of employees value of contract
and Industry there are two additional
checkboxes in the tool configuration
we're not going to check these options
for more information see the section
below the video for additional materials
now that the model is set up let's add a
browse tool to the our output of the
linear regression tool right click on
the linear regression tool and select
add browse after reports this will
produce a report that we can read and
assess how good the model is</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
