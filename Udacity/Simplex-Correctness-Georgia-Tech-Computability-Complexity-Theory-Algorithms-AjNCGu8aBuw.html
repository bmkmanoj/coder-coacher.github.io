algorithm is correct giving us a basic
feasible solution for bounded linear
programs and reporting that unbounded
ones are unbounded let's consider the
bounded case first first we recognize
that at each step we make some progress
usually improving the objective value we
have to be careful here in the case of
degenerate basic solutions going back to
the algorithm
remember that we picked the new column
to go into the basis because it had a
positive corresponding value in Rd and
hence increasing it increased the
objective value the trouble is that if
the current basic solution is degenerate
that is to say that V has a 0 entry it's
possible that we won't get to move in
this direction at all the nightmare
scenario is that we end up in some kind
of cycle there are two ways of coping
with this challenge
one is to perturb the constraints
slightly the other is to give preference
to lower indexed columns for both
entering and leaving the basis this is
known as Bland's rule in either case we
can be assured of making some progress
in each step but I'll put an asterisk
here because the notion is a little
tricky clearly we have a finite number
of steps because there are only n choose
M possible basis and because we make
progress we don't cycle among them now
we just need to make sure that we don't
stop too early there are two possible
ways the algorithm can terminate either
because U is non positive or because Rd
is let's consider the termination
because of you first this turns out to
be pretty trivial if u is non positive
then we get to keep going in the
direction of DQ here as much as we want
increase of the objective value of the
whole way so clearly the problem is
unbounded and of course that can't
happen because we've assumed that the
linear program is bounded let's consider
what happens when we terminate on the Rd
condition then we'll let X star be an
optimal feasible solution that's not
necessarily basic and we'll let X
be a basic suboptimal solution well
using the basis for this basic
suboptimal solution I can write xB star
in these terms here this just comes from
the Equality constraint and the
feasibility of X star
substituting this expression back into
the objective function gives me this
result here this expression here is the
same Rd that we obtained in the simplex
method and because X is suboptimal we
then have this strict inequality here
because X is basic and B as its basis
however X D is 0 so we can simply
annihilate this term also X D star is
non-negative so for the strict
inequality to hold at least one entry of
our D must be positive hence if there's
a better solution the simplex algorithm
won't terminate that wraps up the case
where the program is bounded how about
when it's unbounded we'll by the same
argument just given we won't hit the
case where our D is non positive and the
algorithm can't run forever because it
avoids cycling and thus can only visit
each of the n choose M basis once the
only remaining possibility is that you
will be non positive at some point and
we'll report that the problem is
unbounded which indeed it is</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
