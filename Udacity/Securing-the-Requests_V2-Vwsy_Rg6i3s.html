working fine but there's potentially a
big security problem if you've been
paying attention or requests for this
app are being sent using HTTP we can see
this if we go to the app constants file
we notice that our API scheme is HTTP
and this scheme is what's being used
here we go and the tmdb URL from
parameters it's using our API scheme
which is HTTP now while we've defined
the proper settings in the info dot
plist file to allow for this there's
still a big security risk especially if
we're making requests that send user
names and passwords as parameters of a
URL like we did when we logged in
through the API let me show you what I'm
talking about so let's go back to the
login view controller let's find that
log in with token method here we go
let's add a print statement that shows
the URL for the login request that we're
making in our login with token method
when I click the login button
okay here's her URL so I've clicked the
login button and we can see that the URL
is being printed where the username and
password are sent as plain text so if
somebody was watching the network
traffic going from my phone to a server
or even from my simulator to a server
they could see these values and this is
obviously very bad let me show you how
this might look for somebody who's
snooping on network traffic I'm gonna do
this using an application called Charles
you don't need to install Charles
yourself I'm just gonna use it for this
example
in Charles we can see all the web
traffic that's incoming and outgoing on
this particular machine so I want to see
the requests that are being sent to the
movie database and as you can see we've
made a request recently if I select this
request and then I go look at the
summary I can actually see what the
traffic looks like as it's leaving my
machine so I can take a closer look and
here's our validate with login method I
can actually see my username here and
then here's my password in plain
daylight for everyone to see so we
definitely need to fix this but
thankfully it can be done really quickly
since the movie database provides us a
way to send requests like these securely
if we go
to the documentation we can take a look
at this HTTPS SSL section and as we can
see it simply tells us instead of making
an HTTP call we just need to make an
HTTP call and then we're set what this
is effectively going to do is by making
the HTTP calls it's going to encrypt all
the data that's being sent from our app
so that nobody can snoop on us if you
want to hear more about HTTP now I put a
link in the instructor notes to our web
development discussions on the topic
okay so to fix the problem we just need
to make one small change in the
constants will fall let's change our
scheme from HTTP to HTTPS
now we'll build this project let's go
and login now I'll go ahead and switch
back over to Charles and you'll see that
we have the HTTP request that we
previously did and then these HTTP
requests and as you can see since we're
using HTTP we don't really know anything
in terms of snooping about what's
happening in that request
whereas we can still see things that are
being passed with this request the best
part about all this is we're pretty much
getting it all for free because the
movie database supports HTTPS so when in
doubt just use HTTPS</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
