consistency model which is called
release consistency I'm sure just from
the keyword release some of you may have
already formed a mental model of what
I'm going to say basically we're going
to look at the structure of the program
as follows that the parallel program
consists of several different parallel
threads p1 is one such and if it wants
to mess with some shared data structures
it is going to acquire a lock we'll call
it a1 and in the mind of the programmer
there is an association between this
lock and the data structure is governed
by it so so long as they hold the lock
they can modify this data structure and
r1 is the release of this lock so every
critical section you can think of as
composed of an acquire followed by data
accesses governed by the lock and then a
release if the same lock is used by some
other process of p2 and if the critical
section of p1 preceded the critical
section of p2 or in other words P ones
release operation p1 r1 the the released
operation on p1 happened before this
must be familiar to you from our
discussion of lamport's logical clock P
1 R 1 happens before P 2 R 2 that is the
acquire operation that is being done by
P 2 if this acquire operation for the
same lock happened after the release by
P 1 R 1 all that we have to ensure is
that all the coherence actions prior to
this release of the lock by p1 has to be
complete before we allow p2 to acquire
this lock before we allow p2 to acquire
the same lock L that's the idea of
release consistency so we take the
synchronization operations that are
provided by the system whether it is
hardware or software
and we label them as either an acquire
operation or a release operation so it's
very straightforward when you think
about mutual exclusion lock acquiring
the lock primitive is an acquire
operation and the unlock primitive is a
release operation so if there is a lock
primitive and there is a preceding
unlock primitive so we have to ensure
that all the coherence actions happen
before I do the unlock so that when this
guy gets the lock and accesses the data
the data that he is going to see are
going to be data that is consistent with
whatever modifications may have been
made over here that's the idea behind
release consistent memory operation
other synchronization operations can
also be mapped acquired and release if
you think about the barrier arriving at
a barrier is equivalent to an acquire
and leaving the barrier is equivalent to
a release so before leaving the barrier
we have to make sure that any changes
that we made to shared data structures
is reflected to all the other processes
through the cache coherence mechanism
then we can leave the barrier so leaving
the barrier is a release operation in
the case of barrier synchronization so
what that means is that if I do a shared
memory access within this critical
section and that shared memory access
would normally result in some coherence
actions on the interconnect reaching to
the other processes and so on and if it
is a SC memory model you will block
processor p1 until that particular
memory access is complete with respect
to all the processes in the shared
memory machine but if we use the least
consistent memory model we do not have
to block p1 in order for coherence
actions to be complete to let the
processor continue on with its
computation we only have to block the
processor at a release point to make
sure that any coherence actions that may
have been initiated up until this point
are all complete before we perform the
release operation that's the key
point that I want you to get out of the
release consistent memory model so the
release consistent memory model allows
exploitation of computation on p1 with
communication that may be happening
through the coherence mechanism for
completing the coherence actions
corresponding to the memory accesses
that we're making inside the critical
section</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
