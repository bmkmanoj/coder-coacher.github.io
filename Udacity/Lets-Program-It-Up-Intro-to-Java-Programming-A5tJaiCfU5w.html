first we know what we want to test so
i'll go into the plot tester and i'll
create a new plot of the size that we
did the example for and then i'll print
out the actual which should be the
number of fields if the radius is 400
and then i'll print out the expected
number that we calculated which was
eight now to actually do the calculation
first thing i do is calculate the number
of rows which should be an int and the
way that we did that was to calculate
the length minus the diameter divided by
the radius times the square root of
three but that wasn't counting the first
row so I've got to add the first row
back and since there are some doubles in
here I won't automatically get integer
division so to drop the fractional part
I'll need to actually cast this now I
haven't actually defined diameter but
that's just twice the radius after that
I calculated the number of odd rows
which was the total number of rows plus
1/2 and the number of even rows was just
n rows over to the number of columns in
each odd row was based on the width and
the diameter I want to make sure that I
actually get an int here so I noticed
that the width is an int and the
diameter is also an int so that's good
the columns in an even row was the width
but we couldn't use that first space at
the left so we have to subtract off one
radius before we divide to see how many
diameters fit across and then the total
number of fields is the odd rows times
the number of columns per odd row and
then the number of even rows times the
number of columns per even row and this
number of total fields is what we wanted
to return let's find all my typos Oh got
lucky that time let's see if the plot
tester agrees looks like it at least
worked for the example that we checked
that's a good sign that was a pretty
tricky problem if you struggled way to
stick with it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
