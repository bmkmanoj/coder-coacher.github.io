objects like numbers or strings with
associated operations and we've run into
things like numbers and strings before
but there are more exotic types and that
also support operations and as we can
see even from this little doodle diagram
sometimes their operations like + that
apply to all of these things I can add
two numbers using arithmetic I can
concatenate two strings or I can append
together two lists they mean almost the
same thing but not really arithmetic
addition is not really the same as
drinking catenation
similarly both strings and lists support
lengths here it's the number of
characters here it's the number of
elements each one of these things number
string list is a type and what we
basically want to do is make sure that
we're not mistakenly combining elements
from various types or unsafely calling
non-associated operations for example
five divided by two makes a lot of sense
but the string hello divided by the
string six we have no idea what this
means division isn't one of the
operators for Strings even though it is
one of the operators for numbers let me
give you another analogy of this that
sort of bears reference to the real
world the word execute can mean many
different things depending on what it's
being applied to a computer can execute
a program which means to run it or to
carry it out there are some governments
in the world that will execute their
citizens and this means to kill
typically in a judicial context these do
not mean the same thing but the word
looks otherwise similar and it falls in
the same sort of grammatical pattern
they're both verbs being applied to
objects we're going to need to tell the
difference</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
