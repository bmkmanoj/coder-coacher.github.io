from during this lesson are one from
Dwyane Perry and Alex woof that involves
elements forms and rationale rationale
being the set of decisions and the
reasons for making them that the
architects have agreed on obviously
architecture involves the fundamental
organization components and
relationships this comes from the I
Triple E definition another element from
ver Hoff is the determination of what
makes up the components here based upon
hiding away those things which are
hardest to change that's a little bit
different way of thinking about a system
but if you imagine what the system is
going to be like several years after its
initial release it's going to change and
those changes have the potential of
breaking the system in unexpected ways
so by hiding away those tough decisions
we can help reduce the overall
maintenance costs downstream and then
for the rest of this lesson we're going
to be guided by the garland and cha
paper which is listed on the class
resource page and they talk about
architecture in terms of its components
its connectors and its configurations
what do they mean by these three terms
well a component is a computational or a
data element plus its interfaces which
they call ports interfaces to the rest
of the system the interfaces express
what the component requires or needs
from the rest of the system and what it
provides recall from the UML component
diagrams this is exactly what the
interfaces represent a connector is a
essentially a communication protocol
among components although it may have
code associated with it for enforcing
that particular protocol it is its major
element of defining the connector is
that protocol
and then configurations is how you put
those pieces together you plug a
connector into a component you plug the
other end of the connector into another
component if it's a binary connector and
the ports then can talk to each other
using the connector that overall
topology for the pieces is called a
configuration</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
