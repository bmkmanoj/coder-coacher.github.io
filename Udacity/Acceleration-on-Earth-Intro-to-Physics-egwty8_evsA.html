we'll be able to answer a simple
question right
for example if Galileo drops a ball off
the Leaning Tower how far does it fall
in two seconds can we answer that well
we won no distance so I'm thinking we're
going to use our relationship with X and
somehow proportional the T squared but
unfortunately this is not enough
information
remember how we solved this we used
ratios ratios mean we need to compare
two things if I knew how far the ball
fell in one second during 10 seconds or
in 7 seconds yes I could solve this but
I haven't even told you that looks like
we might be in trouble what we want is
not a proportionality relationship we
want in equality we want x equals some
constant some number that never changes
times T squared and this constant is
called the constant of proportionality
so before I just tell you what the
constant is let's learn about an amazing
physical tool called dimensional
analysis where dimensional refers to the
dimensions or units of a number because
right now we know nothing about this
constant it could have units of length I
could have units of time it could have
units of x squared over length cubed we
just don't know let's use dimensional
analysis to figure out what the units of
this constant should be we do
dimensional analysis by converting
everything into units of length time and
mass or some combination of these let me
show you what I mean let's look at this
equation x equals something times x
squared and just keep track of the units
while X is a unit of length unit of
distance so on the left hand side all
right Mike and that equals some well
unknown here multiplied by something
with units of time squared
solving for my question mark I find that
the units of this unknown constant are
length over x squared and Y has units of
length over x squared
while length over x squared could be
something like well meters per second
squared and that's acceleration so this
constant of proportionality that relates
time and position has units of
acceleration pretty cool turns out that
this constant of proportionality is just
1/2 the acceleration of the object that
we're talking about for objects in free
fall on earth this acceleration happens
speak will 210 meters per second squared
which is why I've been using this as an
example acceleration so much in fact
this number is so important we give it
the abbreviate
little G but keep in mind we only use
this number when objects in free fall
when objects rolling this acceleration
will be well you tell me does an object
rolling accelerate faster or slower</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
