first example is that the maximum
slowdown is 32 there are only 32 threads
and warp so no matter no matter how many
cases there are no matter how many ways
you can branch you're not going to
branch more than thirty two ways in a
single warp because there's only 32
threads in that warp so again the
maximum here is going to be 32 32 X slow
down for just this segment of code right
for this switch statement in particular
what about this case we're going to
switch on a thread index of Y so the
thing you need to understand is that
CUDA assigns thread IDs to warps in such
a way that the ex ID varies fastest the
y ID very slower the CID very slowest
and this is much more clear if I use a
concrete example so in my quiz question
I have a 64 x 16 thread block so let's
just draw that out here's thread with X
id0 xid 1x ID 2 and so forth and these
are the y ID so this first row is why ed
won the second rail has why ed to all
the way down to why I d16 and when CUDA
assigns these two warps it will launch a
warp with 32 threads comprising X IDs 0
through 31 then another warp again with
32 threads containing thread IDs 32
through 63 and you have another warp
with why I d equal to 1 and X ID varying
from 0 to 31 and so forth so now we know
the answer to our question all of the
threads in a given warp in this case
belong to the same y ID they all have
the same y ID and that means that we'll
get no slow down at all because all of
the threads will be branching to the
same place what about this next case
where we've got a smaller thread block
that has 16 by 16 threads so in this
case we only have 16 X IDs that it can
assign to a warp before it has to change
to the next y ID and start assigning the
next set of X IDs so all of these
threads will be placed into a single
warp the first 16 and the first half of
the warp the next 16 in the next half of
the warp next all of these threads will
be placed into a warp and so on and so
now as you can see there are two
different y IDs for the threads in a
single warp so we'll end up having to
execute this code
ice for this warp once with one yd ones
with the second why ID will end up with
a total of a 2x slow down</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
