that we will discuss and that has seen
an increase in both research and in
practice is mindfulness training and
psychotherapy specifically
mindfulness-based cognitive therapy are
in BCT is an approach that combines
elements of both cognitive behavioral
therapy with mindfulness meditation to
help people with depression for instance
to learn to recognize and restructure
negative thought patterns this therapy
uses both mindfulness meditation and
cognitive therapy to restructure one's
thoughts so mindfulness meditation
developed skills for approaching
thoughts in a non-judgmental way and
enhances people's ability to realize
that they are neither bound nor defined
by their thoughts feelings and
sensations and to detect symptoms before
they become a problem so this approach
has been used successfully in preventing
the relapse and depression and in
addition there's some research to show
that mindfulness based meditation
therapy has been used successfully in
treating positive and negative symptoms
of schizophrenia the idea here is that
this therapy can be used by teaching
people with schizophrenia to learn to
live more easily with their symptoms and
to not be defined or controlled by them
one new approach focuses on changing the
relationship that people have with the
voices in their heads rather than trying
to make those voices go away some early
studies have shown that this technique
results in less distressed and improve
functioning after training and
mindfulness meditation so if you're
interested in trying meditation take a
look in the instructors notes box we've
provided you with a link to more
information about mindfulness meditation</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
