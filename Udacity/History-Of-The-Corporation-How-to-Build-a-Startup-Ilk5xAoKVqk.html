was first formed in 1602 with the
government chartered Dutch East India
Company this is kind of the first modern
corporation with shareholders and
organizations that kind of if you
squinted looked like something close to
modern companies today by the 1850s in
the United States with railroads
spanning the entire country corporations
needed more sophisticated organizations
and in fact the first org chart was
drawn in 1856 to just manage
corporations and by the beginning of the
20th century educators started realizing
that there was a need for a educated
management class to administer and
execute these corporations because at
least in the United States we were going
from local economies to regional
economies to a national economy yet we
did not have a trained management class
and so in a brilliant insight Harvard
set up the first Masters of Business
Administration course called the MBA and
the first graduating class in 1910 was
the first of a cadre of business
administrators that made the 20th
century the modern corporate century the
MBA curriculum is designed to provide
managers and administrators with the
tools they needed to run existing and
growing companies accounting strategy
operations leadership organizational
behavior human resources management and
this stack of tools was just incredibly
important for the growth of large
companies but what's really interesting
what got missed is that there were
really no tools provided in these
curriculums for starting new businesses
one of the things we did not understand
for a hundred years is that startups are
not smaller versions of large companies
let me say it again
startups are not smaller versions of
large companies and what falls out of
that is all the traditional tools taught
and learned in an MBA curriculum are
irrelevant in the first chaotic year
- of an early-stage venture eventually
you need that tool set but at first it
really gets in the way</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
