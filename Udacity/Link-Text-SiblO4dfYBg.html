list of links on a page using voiceover
and even search through them
this feature is obviously most useful if
firstly the screen reader can find the
links and secondly if the actual text of
the links is meaningful for the first
there are three common patterns that we
see which can cause the screen root to
miss links in the page one is using a
span with some link styling or an anchor
tag without an H or F attribute this is
popular for single page applications
when you have something which is
effectively an internal link which does
some JavaScript based navigation within
the app or Us phone you want something
which performs an action but looks like
a link for anything which behaves like a
link including within a single page
application you should absolutely use an
anchor tag with an href attribute no
exceptions you can read more about how
to make those links work nicely with
smooth single page app navigation in the
instructor notes but for now let's focus
on what it means for accessibility not
only will this make the link shop in the
links list but it will mean it
automatically works with the keyboard
and that you can do things like copy or
bookmark the link location the second
pattern is the opposite problem
something which is implemented using a
link but is really more like a button
you can often recognize this by the href
attribute being something nonsensical
for this case we'll just replace that
anchor tag with a button tag and style
it appropriately in the next class we'll
learn another technique for making
elements appear to have a different role
to assistive technology and the third
example is where we have an image used
as a link content for example sometimes
you might have a piece of text which
needs a very specific style like a logo
and which is implemented as an image to
the average sighted user this works fine
because they can still understand what
the link is for however for an assistive
technology user this makes the link
unusable we can fix that by using our
usual alt text technique to make sure
the link is exposed directly to the
assistive technology layer just make
sure the image has alt text so that
takes care of making sure the screen
reader can find the links but we also
need to make sure that once the link
makes it into the links list that is
also useful
we do that by making sure its text is
descriptive the webaim checklist has a
stronger and weaker version at this
point the stronger one item two point
four point nine states that the purpose
of each link should be able to be
determined from the link text alone the
Wikipedia example that Victor showed had
a lot of really useful link text
examples because of the way a wiki
format encourages creating links which
use the pages title as the text in
general link text should give any user
enough information to decide whether
they want to click it one common example
of uninformative link text we see a lot
these days is learn more
usually this leads to a longer article
about the subject of the preceding
sentence or paragraph so one way we can
make it more useful for everyone is to
rewrite the text to say something like
learn more about responsive layouts in
this case or even making responsive
layouts the paragraph heading the link
this also means if I'm visually skimming
the page for links I don't need to
backtrack through the rest of the
paragraph to see what the link might be
