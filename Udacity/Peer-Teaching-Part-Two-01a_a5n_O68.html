point every time the learner answers a
question correctly anakata sent that
means a lot of sense so you basically
get credit for being right the learner
gets learner gets credit for being right
ok I'm also going to give +1 to the
teacher and for the teacher I am also
going to give them credit plus one every
time the learner answers correctly good
so they're their incentives are aligned
yes their incentives are aligned the
learner gets credit for demonstrating
they've learned and the teacher gets
credit for demonstrating they at least
know something so what do you think is
going to happen here the learners happy
getting answers right and the teachers
happy when the learner gets answered
answers right so they should work
together to maximize I guess not
necessarily learning but you know ask
easy questions if you ask easy questions
then the learner wins and the teacher
wins that's exactly right I think so I
hopefully that makes sense so if let's
say this question or questions way down
here are so easy that anybody can get
them right then if I ask questions down
here the learner will get them right so
that's good for the learner but also
because the learner will get them right
that's good for the teacher right but
that doesn't seem to really make sense
for this problem in that we really want
to be asking questions roughly at the
level where the learner is well that
makes sense well let me ask you one
other quick before we get there let me
ask you one other possibility since this
doesn't give us what we want right
basically this says always stick to easy
questions right and we'll both do well
what happens if I say ok well the
problem here is I've incentivize the
learner in a way that kind of makes
sense right learner wants to get correct
answer good questions right but I've
incentivized a teacher to go easy on the
student so why don't I make it so that
the teacher loses a point every time the
student gets something right oh so now
this the teacher is not incentivized
just to give easy questions what's gonna
happen here well part of me feels like
that no like it just seems like the
right thing for the teacher to do then
from the teachers perspective is give
hard questions the learner should try to
answer them but the learners not going
to be able to write so what I should do
is just immediately go to all the really
really hard questions about dinosaurs
you can't answer them
you don't have the background and you
know the sort of fundamental math and
calculus to answer the questions about
dinosaurs and they're going to keep
getting them wrong but the teacher is
going to do just fine in fact not only
will the teacher lose a point every time
they learn to answer something correctly
let's say actually the teacher gets a
point every time the learner answers
incorrectly which is sort of the same
thing yeah but allows me to say the
teacher racks up points yes by making
you do things that are wrong okay so
this is just kind of broken right yeah
the kind of obvious thing to do here
where I'm going to give the student
credit for demonstrating things
demonstrating they've learned things
they have knowledge and give the teacher
credit for either demonstrating that the
student has knowledge or doesn't have
knowledge gives me bad answers and in
particular doesn't help me with the goal
of learning it doesn't help the student
and it doesn't help the teacher it just
gives them whatever credit they're
supposed to get when they can bother to
get it well so if okay if the teacher
getting +1 for the learner getting
something correctly ended up making
things too easy and a minus one made
things too hard then right in the middle
is a zero what about the teacher gets
zero for the learner answer incorrectly
well the teacher gets zero for the
learner answer incorrectly and doesn't
matter what the teacher does so maybe
the teacher can do the right thing now
but why it's just like the cocoa example
you're giving before what reason do I
have and we certainly don't want the
student to the teachers payment although
would that work in this case no because
now that the learner would want to get
to maximize the side payment then we're
back to the original problem that you
said which is if the teachers paid off
for correct for the learner giving
correct answers then then the questions
are just going to end up being too easy
to be meaningful that's right and
there's really no side payment for the
teacher to give the student but you said
something earlier that I really like you
said what do you say you said so before
we went down this path of the minus one
and getting hard questions you said
something about what the the teacher
ought to be doing the teacher ought to
be asking questions I don't know so that
the the learner is kind of getting half
of them right so I like that so let's
let's sort of take a step back and kind
of see what that would sort of me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
