qualities of good data visualization so
for me it definitely depends on the
purpose of the data visualization I tend
to draw a distinction between the
exploratory and the explanatory where
exploratory are really trying to get a
sense of what the data is what it can
tell you and it's the process of turning
over maybe a hundred different rocks to
try to find those one or two interesting
nuggets
then once you've found the interesting
now gets during the explanatory space of
wanting to then communicate those things
to somebody else so when it comes to
effective data visualization on the
exploratory side it's about allowing
your users to be able to connect things
in interesting ways and look at data
from different angles in an unbiased and
unli ting way on the explanatory side
which is where I spend most of the time
in my work teaching and writing I
typically cover five key lessons for
success so the first is having a really
robust understanding of the context who
your audience is and what they need to
know or do before you really even start
thinking about how you're going to show
the data then when it comes to showing
the data the second lesson is around
choosing an appropriate type of visual
so you want to think really about what
is it you want your audience to do with
the information and what sort of graph
or other visual types going to allow
them to do that in the most easy
straightforward fashion third lesson is
around clutter getting comfortable
identifying and eliminating those things
that aren't adding informative value to
our visuals and cutting those doing so
decreases cognitive load and also causes
our data to just stand out more and when
it comes to our data standing out more
the fourth lesson is around drawing your
audience's attention to where you want
them to pay so using color and size and
placement on page strategically as
indicators to your audience that say hey
this is most important and look here
first or this is next most important pay
attention here next and so on and so
forth and the final lesson is around
story for me the most successful
explanatory data visualizations make
themselves a pivotal point in a story or
a narrative
that's being told</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
