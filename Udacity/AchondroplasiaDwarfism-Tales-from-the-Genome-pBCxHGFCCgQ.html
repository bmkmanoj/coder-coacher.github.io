here and it actually brings back some
really great memories when I was 10 I
was on a television show outside of WGBH
in Boston which is where I grew up and I
was one of five panelists that had
disabilities and we filmed for two years
and it was a real coming-of-age
experience for me because we were asked
to sit on very hot sets talking about
how do you feel about being different
how do you feel about being teased and
not only was I saving in Psychological
costs I didn't have to see a shrink I
was actually being paid for talking
about my feelings and I really bonded
with the other four individuals and it
was really neat how old were you when
you sort of noticed yourself that you
were different from other people and
maybe when your parents also noticed
this that's a really good question
my parents were given the diagnosis when
I was 18 months old and they wonder to
this day whether or not that was a
delayed diagnosis that no one had the
heart to break it to them now this was
pre DNA testing this was all based on
x-rays and femur length femur is what
they really go for and measuring the
femur length and there we were sitting
in Boston one of the top medical
communities in the country and the
gentleman that gave my parents the
diagnosis was T berry Brazelton who was
sort of the dr. Spock not the sci-fi
doctor Spock but sort of the the
pediatric voice of America in the 70s
and so I love to tell people that I was
diagnosed by that man myself so they
knew when I was 18 months old I think
many little people like myself do not
come to their own realization until
they're in school because that's when
the cheesing really starts and the
accessibility if you will especially
back then you know we're talking about
the 70s there wasn't any Americans with
Disability Act so that's when I was
having to struggle to
access what my fellow students were
accessing so I I think the word has
finally gotten out what the correct
terminology is but just in case let me
educate you on that the when when little
people of America was first formed in
1957 the name was actually midgets of
America it was primarily a venue for
entertainer entertainers and they kind
of made light of their union for lack of
a better word
well then slowly educated serious people
started joining the group and one of the
first tasks at hand was to get rid of
the rid of the word midget now what's
wrong with the word midget for me and
many others it conjures up the image of
vaudeville when they were called midget
performers and they would go around much
like a traveling circus and they would
get on stage and you would see a little
person like myself with a cigar hanging
out of their mouth and a diaper on and
making total fools of themselves so when
I hear the word midget that's what I
conjure up in my mind as too many in our
organizations I think the word is
finally dying occasionally it will be
used in hockey leagues it's still used
up in Canada signifying the younger kids
I think and and I I think the little
people group up there has been really
working on that so the terminology that
I'm comfortable with the long-winded
answer is I'm comfortable with little
person and I'm comfortable with dwarf
because that's what I was raised with
now that's not to say that my children
and they're okay with that too but maybe
my grandchildren will have come up with
a new term</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
