need a machine model will use a
variation on the von Neumann
architecture here's a picture of von Oy
men from 1956 the von Neumann
architecture has a processor for the
moment assume the processor is
sequential this processor does basic
computing operations these are things
like addition subtraction branches and
so on now the processor connects to a
main memory you regard this memory as
being nearly infinite but really slow
hang on I'm coming I'm coming between
the processor in the slow memory there's
a fast memory however the memory is also
small let's denote the size of this
memory by capital z measured in words
you're probably already familiar with
two-level memory hierarchies consider
for example a real processor like an
intel Ivy Bridge multi-core processor
the fast memory might be say a last
level cache that sits between a slower
main memory not shown in the photo and
the processor or what about this example
this is an adaptive ax parallel aboard
which is collecting dust in my office
it's collecting dust mostly because I'm
sitting around drawing cartoons instead
of doing say real hacking do I even know
how to program anymore the parallel has
a slow non-volatile SD card which acts
as a disk it also has a smaller amount
of main memory pulling data out of main
memory is a lot faster than pulling it
off the SD card ok where was I all right
there are two rules about how
computations run in this model here's
the first rule the processor cannot do
any operations unless the operands sit
in fast memory I'll refer to this as the
local data rule here's the second rule
it's called the block transfer rule it
says that when data moves back and forth
across this channel between slow memory
and fast memory it does so in chunks of
size l words that is consider the
following scenario suppose you want to
load a word at address X from main
memory the block transfer rule says you
actually have to pay to move in
additional L minus 1 nearby words now
which words come with the word at X
depend on how your data is aligned in
slow memory in other words when you
design an algorithm in this model data
alignment might be another issue you
have to
still most real life memory systems do
block transfers so you need to think
about multi-level memories and block
transfers when designing
high-performance algorithms like it or
not as I've stated it this model implies
two major costs you need to think about
when designing algorithms first how many
operations does the algorithm require in
other words what's the computational
work that the processor needs to do just
like the concept of work in the works
span model for a parallel machine the
concept of work in this i/o model will
generally depend on the input size in
then there's the second cost how many
block transfers does the algorithm need
to do as you might expect the number of
transfers might depend on both the size
of the fast memory as well as the block
transfer size let's denote the number of
transfers by Q and refer to it as the
algorithms IO complexity to make this
more concrete let me walk you through a
very simple example suppose you want to
sum the elements of an array of size n
you know the processor needs to do at
least n minus 1 additions or
asymptotically that's big Omega of n
operations what about memory transfers
intuitively you know you need to make at
least one pass through the data that
suggests a natural lower bound on
transfers that's the ceiling of n
divided by L the ceiling accounts for
the fact that if n is not a multiple of
L then you need to pay for a partial
transfer somewhere now there's another
thing to notice about this expression it
does not depend on capital Z the size of
the fast memory that makes sense right
you only need to touch each element once
so whether the fast memory is very large
or very small it really doesn't matter
reduction does not reuse data and not
reusing data is bad</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
