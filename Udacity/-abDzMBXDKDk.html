that only shows English words but we
want me walk translations to appear as
well so here I am in the numbers
activity and so far we've been using a
layout that is provided by the android
framework and it's defined in the simple
underscore list underscore item
underscore one dot xml file so remember
that simple underscore list underscore
item underscore one is one of many types
of layouts that's been created by the
Android team and as part of the android
framework so to see a list of all the
layouts in the android framework check
out the r dot layout page in the android
developers guide so if we scroll down a
bit we'll see that item layout that
we're interested in so to learn more
about this layout I'm actually gonna do
a Google search on it so this is the
code developed by the Android team to
develop this specific layout and as you
can see here it only contains one
textview now we really need a list item
that has more than one textview so let's
build our own layout with two text views
then we need to assign view IDs to the
text views as well because we'll need to
refer to these views later in the java
code so at this point we're not too
worried about the details of what the
list item layout looks like we're just
trying to get the right data on the
screen to make sure the logic and our
code is working correctly then later on
we can make the list items visually look
nicer now remember that the adapter
knows how to populate this list item for
a single word in the list and that's why
we only need the layout for a single
item because that same pattern will be
used repeatedly so for this exercise I'd
like you to create a new layout file for
how a single list item should look and
here's an example of that note the 16 DP
pattern on both the top and left hand
side also notice that the Miwok word is
on top of the English word because we
want users to pay more attention to them
you walk word later in the visual polish
section of lesson 3 will make them Miwok
word even more prominent by bolding the
word next assign view IDs to the text
views so that we can refer to them later
in the Java code and after you're done
with this I like you to answer this
question which view group did you use as
the route view in this layout</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
