is from negative 5 2 negative 2 when we
solve compound inequalities we need to
solve each of the inequalities
independently and since they're
connected with an and we're going to
need to look at the intersection of
these two solutions so let's solve this
inequality first i'm going to subtract
2x from both sides which gives me
negative 1 is greater than 2x plus 3
subtract 3 from both sides negative 4 is
greater than 2x divide both sides by 2
and i get negative 2 is greater than x
it's important to know that negative 2
greater than x is the same as x is less
than negative 2 so we have the solution
to our first inequality let's solve our
second inequality this time i'm going to
subtract 3x from both sides when i
subtract 3x from both sides i get 2x
plus 3 is greater than or equal to
negative 7 subtract 3 from both sides
and i get 2x is greater than or equal to
negative 10 once again divide both sides
by 2 and i get that x is greater than or
equal to negative 5 now that i have
solved both inequalities i have to see
where these intervals overlap i'm going
to use a number line i'm going to draw
the solution to the two inequalities on
top of this number line x is less than
negative 2 uses a parentheses and the
solution is less than negative 2 and 4 x
greater than or equal to negative 5 i
have a square bracket at negative 5 and
my solution goes to the right since this
is an and inequality we have to look at
where these two intervals overlap as you
can see they overlap from negative 5 2
negative 2 so I can draw the actual
solution on the number line which means
from negative 5 2 negative 2 and
everything in between let's try another
compound inequality</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
