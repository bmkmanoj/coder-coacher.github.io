website containing a live stream of
insightful gibberish from multiple users
it's a pattern you'll have seen on
multiple social networking sites and
we're calling it whitter just in case
lawyers are watching I've added it to my
home screen so it looks like a native
app I might get from the Play Store
except it still has all the benefits of
the web we call it a progressive app or
we would if it weren't for one little
problem if I open it when I don't have
an internet connection I get this this
is a problem but not our biggest problem
this is I call it life I let's enjoy the
fruits of life I for a moment shall we
this is it just this
forever and ever you're in connection
limbo you could just put your phone in
your pocket and get on with something
else but you keep waiting because it
might suddenly load maybe within the
next five seconds no you should probably
give up now but you know in your heart
that one second after you give up that
would be the moment it would have worked
if only you'd waited so you wait and
wait this situation can be caused by
your phone barely holding on to a
connection but sometimes your phone
thinks is acing it in the connection
Department but nothing is getting
through the problem is further down the
line somewhere between you and the
server where the app and data lives
there's a lot in between your phone and
the server your phone sends the request
to the Wi-Fi Rooter or cell tower then
on to the ISP through intermediate
proxies and potentially across to the
other side of the world and eventually
the request reaches the destination
server but that's only half the journey
because the server response and that
response needs to go all the way back
across the world through proxies through
ISPs over the air and land safe and
sound on your phone but if something
along the way fails the whole thing
fails if something along the way runs
slowly then the whole thing runs slow
and therein lies life I may be you have
bad signal or maybe you have perfect
signal but the roots are all tower
you're connected to is overloaded for
example a crowded Stadium or a train
station has just been hit by major
delays everyone's on their phone trying
to find another way home and the cell
tower can't cope when people need it
most or maybe there's a faulty or busy
proxy maybe the destination server is
busy or has a bug loads of stuff can go
wrong and we can't protect any of this
ahead of time the only way to know if we
can get a response is to send a request
and see what happens and that can take a
grueling ly long time and the worst
thing we can leave the user with is
nothing
let's do better</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
