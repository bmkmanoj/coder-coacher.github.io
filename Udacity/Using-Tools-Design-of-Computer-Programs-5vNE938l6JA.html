maximize differential strategy versus
the maximizing probability of winning
strategy the question is how do these
two compare when are they different and
when are they the same if you're trying
to impress the scouts you're not going
to make be making some crazy moves so
probably most the time you'd expect the
two strategies to agree but some of the
time maybe one of them is going to be
more aggressive or taking more chances
than the other let's see if we can
analyze that so I start off by defining
a bunch of states and I'm just going to
look from one players point of view it
doesn't really matter to have both since
it's symmetric so for all these values
of me you and pending collect all those
states turns out there's thirty five
thousand of them then I define a
variable are to be a default dictionary
which counts up integers so it starts at
zero and then I go through all the
states and I increment the count for a
result for the tuple of the action
that's taken by max wins and the action
that's taken by Max diffs and I want to
want to count up it's going to be hold
hold roll roll etc I want to see how
many of each do we have and let's
convert our back to a standard dicked
and there we have it so most the time
twenty-nine thousand seven hundred out
of the 35,000 all strategies agree that
role is the right thing to do and then
another 1,200 times both strategies
agree that hold is the right thing to do
then in two cases they differ so
sometimes max wins says hold and max
diff says roll that happened 381 times
but 10 times more often it's max wins
that says roll and Max dips that says
hold and that actually surprised me so
it's the max wind strategy that's really
more aggressive it's rolling more often
and I thought was going to be the max
diff strategy I thought that was going
to be more aggressive right so that's
the one that's that's trying to impress
the scouts I thought it was going to be
rolling trying to rack up a really big
score but no so the data tells a
different story it's not trying to rack
up a really big store so what's going on
well first it might be nice just to
quantify how different they are since I
kind of asked that question so there's
35 30 1 state
all together and they differ on 39 75
plus 381 and that's twelve percent of
the states that they differ on so what's
the story where do those twelve percent
of the state's come from we still don't
know and and we don't even quite know
what questions to ask but it's here that
some of our design choices start to pay
off so remember we always start our
design with an inventory of concepts and
you know we had things like the dice and
the score and then we got into things
like the utility function and the
quality function so we built all these
up and yes we're building from the
ground up and yes at the top we have a
play pig function and we can still call
that function but at the bottom we have
all these useful tools so now when we're
not just about playing Pig now we're
trying to analyze a situation to
understand this story of why are these
two different I'll play pig by itself
the top level function we define that's
not going to help us but all these
little tools that we built down here
they will be helpful and we can start to
put them together and explore so we
built this this tower and the tower
built up to define the play pig function
and in some languages it's all about
building the tower when you're done
that's all you have but in Python it's
common and in many languages it's a good
design strategy to say let's just build
up components along the way so that we
guess we have the tower but we can also
go out in other directions if we're
interested not just in playing Pig but
we're interested in figuring out this
story then we can quickly assemble
pieces from down here and build
something that can address that so I've
got all the pieces available it makes it
easy to explore but I still need an idea
and here's my idea I expected maximize
differential to be aggressive to try to
rack up the big points and I found out
that it was actually maximizing
probability of winning that was more
aggressive that rolled more often why
could that be and I think I might know
the answer I think it might be that the
maximized differential is more willing
to lose rather than more excited about
winning by a lot what do I mean by that
well if you're maximizing the power bill
of winning you don't care if you lose by
one or if you lose by 40 it's all a loss
the maximized differential if he's
losing by a fair amount he might say
well you know say the say he's behind 39
to nothing in a game to 40 and say he's
accumulated 30 points if he's trying to
maximize the probability of winning he
would keep on rolling he says well I
don't have that good a chance of winning
but all that counts is winning if I stop
now the opponent is going to win on the
next move so I got to keep rolling
probably I'll pig out and only get one
point but it's worth it for that small
chance of winning that's what the
maximize win probability strategy would
do the maximized differential strategy
would say hey if I can get 30 points
rather than one that that cuts the the
differential way down so that's worth
doing I'll sacrifice winning in order to
maximize the differential now that's a
suggestion of a story but I don't know
yet is that the right story let's find
out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
