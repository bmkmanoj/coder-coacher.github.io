distance between any two sample means
that's pretty much finding the range of
all the sample means and this doesn't
give us a good measure of the
variability of sample means that's
because we could add a bunch of samples
to this data set whose means are within
this range and the variability then
wouldn't change if we use the range as
that measure we want to account for all
samples you also found before that the
average deviation adds 20 so this can't
work either if we find the distance each
sample mean is from each of the other
sample means the way might as well do a
bunch of t-tests we'll have to do the
same number of these calculations as T
tests anyway and T tests are a better
measure of whether or not two samples
are statistically different we've
reached our answer find the average
square deviation of each sample mean
from the total mean since we're only
concerned with the variability between
means for now we're not concerned with
the variability between each sample
we're only looking at the mean of each
sample and remember this is how you
calculated the standard deviation if we
had a data set and we find the mean we
found each square deviation from the
mean and then in the case of a sample
standard deviation we divided by n minus
1 that's exactly what we're going to do
and we find the variability between
means the average squared deviation of
each value in each sample from the total
mean also includes the error caused by
individual differences between subjects
in each sample and we don't want to
include this error in our measure of
between subjects variability this is the
total sum of squares and will reference
back to this later for now we're only
concerned with the squared deviations of
each sample mean from the total mean the
mean of all values from all samples this
total mean is called the grand mean in
statistical terms and we're going to
denote this by X bar sub G</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
