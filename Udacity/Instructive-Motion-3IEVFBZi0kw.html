human behavior for example our eyes are
naturally drawn to motion if something
is moving while everything around that
stays the same we're naturally drawn to
the thing that's moving this is a
powerful tool in UI design really useful
for directing your users attention to an
important or immediately relevant UI
element but that's just the beginning we
saw in lesson two that shadows can tell
you a lot about a surface well
how that surface moves can actually tell
you a whole lot about it as well more
specifically an object's motion can
provide important cues about how you
could interact with it
let's take a look take a look at this
example of tabs okay now take a look at
this one can you tell the difference
here they are side by side in both cases
pressing on the tab at the top changes
to that tab but in the second example a
little slide animation is used to switch
tabs this subtle animation helps
communicate that you can actually swipe
the tabs to switch between them
we call this instructive motion without
this kind of instructive motion it would
be less likely that users would discover
this behavior as the spatial
relationship between pages would be less
clear in this example as the music
player controls move into view notice
how the volume control slides into place
this animation provides a subtle cue
that the user can move the slider
horizontally along the track and
remember in lesson 2 how we talked about
the elevations of surfaces and how they
can imply what happens upon scrolling
well it changes in elevation could help
communicate changes in interaction when
two surfaces are adjacent like here at
the same elevation they might move
together but at some point one surface
might change its elevation to
communicate that it now moves
independently of the other one the way
that content enters the scene could also
imply a ways to interact with it in this
example the bottom sheet enters from the
bottom of the screen implying that it
can be dragged upward or dismissed by
dragging it back down
in all these examples of instructive
motion you can see that how something
moves can give you plenty of hints about
how you could interact with it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
