AI agent will have two parts to it our
knowledge base and then the rules of
inference will come to the rules of
inference a little bit later first let
us look at how can we construct a
knowledge-based in the language of logic
so what we are trying to do now is that
an air agent has some knowledge about
the world and is going to express it in
the scheme of logic in earlier schemes
of knowledge representation we discuss
how they were objects and relationships
between objects and any knowledge
representation scheme we need to capture
both objects and relationships between
those objects logic has a particular way
of doing it so consider an object like a
bird this object may have various
arguments and we will define something
called a predicate which is a function
that map's object arguments to either
true or false so let us consider an
example here we have Bluebird as the
object and feathers as the predicate on
this object let's consider this example
here Bluebird is the object and feathers
is a predicate on this object feathers
is now a function that can map either
into true or into false either Bluebird
has feathers or blue bird doesn't have
feathers in this particular case
feathers of blue birds would be true
because blue birds do have feathers and
just like we had blue bird as the object
in the previous example here we have
animal is the object the same predicate
now of course not all animals will have
feathers so this particular predicate
may be true or false depending on the
choice of the animal in this sentence
there are two predicates one object
animals too but there is the predicate
feathers and a predicate bird and we can
capture relationship between these two
predicates by saying that if feathers
animal is true then bird animal is also
true this example has two predicates
here there is one object the animal by
the predicates are feathers and bird and
the sentence is capturing a relationship
between the two predicates if the animal
has feathers then the animal is a bird
and logic we called sentences like this
as having an implication this is an
implicit of relationship so in logic
will read this as feathers animal
implies bird animal or if the
anyone has feathers then it implies that
the animal is a bird</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
