really interesting and a little bit
wacky so we just showed that if you had
a solution to sat you could use it to
solve 3 colorability and maybe that's
not so weird because 3 colorability is
about finding some kind of a satisfying
coloring and so we have a satisfying
formula it's all not so weird now what
we're going to do is the other direction
to show that 3 colorability is np-hard
we know it's an NP but is it np-hard if
it's np-hard it must be np-complete
because it's in NP but to show that it's
np-hard that means we have to take some
np-hard problem and solve it by way of 3
colorability so that means we have to be
able to take a satisfiability formula
somehow express it as a graph coloring
problem and if we can do that that means
a solution to the graph coloring problem
will solve satisfiability and therefore
anything in NP now we're going to take a
little bit of a shortcut just to just so
we can get to the punchline fast and
we're only going to deal not with a full
satisfiability problem which gives any
kind of boolean formula but specifically
3sat 3 tighter just the satisfiability
formulas they have the form like so
where the whole formula is a bunch of
ands of clauses so it's claws and claws
and claws and and so on until all the
clauses have been expressed each clause
itself is the or of three literals and a
literal itself is either a variable or
the negation of a variable not v so you
could have something that looks like X
or not Y or Z and W or X or not Z and
that is a that's a 3sat problem it's not
a very hard 3sat problem that it's a
three-set problem and of clauses each
Clause has three literals each literal
is either the name of a variable or not
the name of a variable now just so
happens that this problem is also
np-hard it's in and we complete just
like satisfiability but it's a lot
easier to work with
so if somebody walks up to us and says
well I have a general satisfiability
question you know it might be easier if
they just walked up to us and said I
have a 3sat question now this is not
easier in the computational complexity
sense it's just easier in the just
working with it and writing an algorithm
sense but the algorithm of the problem
itself is equally hard</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
