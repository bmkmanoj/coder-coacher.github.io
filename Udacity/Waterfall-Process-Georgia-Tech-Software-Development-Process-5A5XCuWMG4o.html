grandfather of all life cycle models and
is the waterfall model in the waterfall
model a project progresses to an orderly
sequence of steps from the initial
software concept down until the final
phase which is system testing and at the
end of each phase there will be a review
to determine whether the project is
ready to advance to the next phase the
pure waterfall model performs well for
software products in which there is a
stable product definition the domain is
well known and the technologies involved
are well understood in this kind of
domains the waterfall model helps you to
find errors in the early local stages of
the projects if you remember what we
discussed this is the place where we
want to find errors not on here because
finding them here will reduce the cost
of our overall software development the
main advantage of the waterfall model is
that it allows you to find errors early
however the main disadvantages of the
waterfall model
arise from the fact that it is not
flexible normally it is difficult to
fully specify requirements at the
beginning of a project and this lack of
flexibility is far from ideal when
dealing with project in which
requirements change the developers are
not domain experts or the technology
used are new and evolving that is it is
less than ideal for most real-world
projects</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
