function and inspect what D is in this
case now that we've transformed the date
and attendance column notice how I've
put a debugger statement and the
anonymous accessor function here so the
execution will stop and be stopped for
every row in our data let's go back to
the web page and see what that looks
like refreshing the page we see here our
first debugger got caught if we click
the play button we'll jump past this
break statement and happen to catch the
break statement in the extent since
execution stopped in this function the
scope is the same scope at this point in
the code notice here that there is a
single argument D to this function so we
should be able to access D in the
console since we have a debugger
statement there here we can see D
corresponds to an object that has the
following fields in it one of which is
the attendance and there was also a date
there notice that this happens to be the
first row in our data set game ID 1 and
as we continue past this debugger
statement it'll catch at every
subsequent row looking at the date here
and we can see that it returns a more
complicated date object in JavaScript to
check for specific data types is
somewhat cumbersome and we have to
basically use the instance of operator
to do a boolean check of what's on the
left side with what's on the right side
so in this case if d bracket date is
indeed a JavaScript date object this
will return true if not it will return
false
as we can see here it has returned true
now if we didn't have any assumption of
what the variable on the Left should be
we'll have to go through each of the
JavaScript primitive types continuously
running the instance of check and
looking at the attendance column here we
can see that it's 25000 rather than the
string 25000 and just a note in
JavaScript it being the flexible
language is we can actually use dot
notation
to access the field of an object or the
bracket notation the one limitation with
the dot notation is if your field
happens to have a space in it if so
you'll have to use the bracket notation
with the string argument but it's
usually good practice to have all the
keys of your object either be a single
word or instead of spaces to use
underscores in this case D the
attendance returns the same value as d
bracket string attendance close bracket
and you'll notice if we try to continue
the debugger repeatedly gets stopped
within the extent function each time D
actually is a different object in this
case I've continued a few times so we're
at game ID 6 continuing one more time D
is now game ID 7 and so forth so let's
remove this debugger from our coats and
so we don't want to go through all eight
hundred plus rows of our data and then
continue to actually create the access
objects from these extents in scales</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
