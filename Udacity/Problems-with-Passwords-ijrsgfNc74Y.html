universally very commonly there are
plenty of problems with passwords people
win predicting the demise of passwords
for a long time because of these
problems but they sort of refuse to go
away so what are some of these problems
for passwords to be strong and by strong
we mean harder to guess they need to be
long and they need to have this upper
lower digits special characters and
things like that we increasing the the
space of possible passwords
well that increases complexity for users
and usability suffers even if we have
good passwords there are problems with
sort of the trusted path discussion that
we had this is sort of related to that
phishing and social engineering attacks
really users don't authenticate who is
really that they are giving their
password to this idea of mutual
authentication you trying to convince
the system that it is really you it's
Alice do you assume that the system is
the true system do you ever ask the
system to authenticate itself to you in
particular instead of if using a remote
service your bank or someone like that
how do you know it's really your bank
it could be someone else it just looks
like your bank and those are the sort of
this phishing attacks that we have
unfortunately once the password is
stolen it can be used many times not a
one-time use sort of a thing and they
can gain access to your account again
and again and the way we address that is
by having policies that say you must
change your password every 90 days or
every six months or whatever it is of
course usability is going to suffer
because of that
and finally humans are humans and they
have a hard time remembering lots of
passwords these days is not just one
system that we have you have your bank
you have your mail you have various
merchants a tailors and and things like
that so you have lots of passwords to
remember you don't want to have the same
password everywhere because when one
gets compromised vulnerable to sort of
all your services that you access
somebody can get to them with that one
stolen password so if you're going to
have different passwords well that's
going to be hard for us to to remember
so many of those passwords if they're
really hard to get
and their long and complex well although
there are many problems there of course
some best practices when it comes to
passwords so when it comes to assists
administrators it's obviously the
password should never be stored in in
the clear so we only store hashed values
and we use salting random salt to avoid
the problems multiple users having the
same password and things like that we
have to limit access to the file where
these password just store the hash
values are stored so shadow files we
talked about and so on and we want to
use a function here that is not fast we
have to do it only once it in it when
the user logs in we don't need to run it
a million times so it doesn't have to be
fast it can be slow on the other hand is
someone doing a brute-force attack has
to run it again and again they have to
100 millions of times
so how using a slow function actually is
helpful and current implementations
actually do that they use slower one-way
hash functions what users can do is a
lot of password managers these days
you're talking about having a lot of
passwords one for each different service
you want to use and hard to remember all
them well the password managers actually
can generate you know complex high
entropy we didn't talk about the the
word entropy but entropy is sort of a
high entropy means it's harder to guess
so they can have these difficult to
guess passwords and they can keep track
of those you you basically have one
strong password to access the password
manager and they can keep track of your
other passwords</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
