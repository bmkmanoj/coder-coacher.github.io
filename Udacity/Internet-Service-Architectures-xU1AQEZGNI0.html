or variable requests right choosing a
configuration that involves multiple
processes configured and potentially
multiple nodes becomes necessary this is
because the multi-process configurations
are the easiest way to deal with scale
to deal with increases in the incoming
requests rates what we'll do in such
cases ace will scale out the service
deployment by launching the same service
on multiple machines and so these are
referred to as scale out architectures a
typical architecture could then be
organized as follows a front-end
dispatching or load balancing component
with a route the incoming requests to
the appropriate or available machine
that implements the internet service
this is in some sense similar to the
boss worker pattern that we discussed
when we talked about structuring
multi-threaded parallel programs one
possibility afterwards is that every
single one of the nodes is capable for
executing any possible step that's
required for the processing of the
requests and that they can handle any
possible requests that may comment from
the external users the other possibility
is that the nodes can be specialized to
execute only some specific step or some
specific steps in the request processing
or they can be specialized only for
certain types of requests this is again
analogous to what we talked about when
discussing the boss worker pattern that
the workers may be general purpose so
they may perform any processing or they
may be specialized for certain tasks we
can further classify these architectures
as those having a property of being
functionally homogeneous like when all
of the workers perform are capable of
performing any processing step or as
functionally heterogeneous like in the
case where certain nodes are specialized
in certain functions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
