will require the use of a wonderful tool
called mathquill mathquill is an
equation editor which means that it
allows us to type things that normal
keyboards don't usually allow like
exponents to type an exponent and math
will you use a carrot let me show you on
my keyboard this is a carrot so to get
this I would hold down shift and hit the
six but your keyboard might be different
still most keyboards will have a carrot
on them so to type X to the sixth what
you would need to type would be X carrot
six after you type the carrot you'll see
your cursor move up into the superscript
area and then you can proceed typing
your exponent to type something after
the exponent you would hit the right
arrow key so that's what it looks like
on my keyboard so after you hit the
right arrow key the cursor will then
return to the normal position out of the
superscript position and you can
continue typing so for example if you
wanted to type x squared Y what you
would hit would be X carrot to right
arrow key why now you try entering these
yourself and you're a couple of other
expressions for you to try and practice
as well try using math quill to type out
X cubed y squared plus 4z as well as 7a
squared B minus C to the fifth and enter
your answers in the boxes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
