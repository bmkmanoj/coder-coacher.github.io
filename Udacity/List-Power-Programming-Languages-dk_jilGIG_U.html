going to introduce suppose that you
wanted to square all of the numbers in
the list 1 2 3 4 5 here's one way to do
it the function map takes a function as
its first argument and then a list and
it applies that function to each element
of the list in turn creating a new list
so I'm gonna make a new list down here
that's the output of map and we're gonna
take one and square it so we get 1 times
1 is 1 now we're gonna take 2 and square
it 2 times 2 is 4 3 and square it it's 9
4 and square it is 16 5 and square it is
25 each one of these led directly to
part of my output this function map is a
big part of functional programming and
it's also a big part of how Google is
able to make very scalable search
engines and related services Map Reduce
is an easily parallelizable functional
programming paradigm lots of power here
I said that map takes a function as its
first argument one way to make a
function is to define it earlier and
refer to it by name but we can also make
a function right now right in this
expression when we need it and pass that
in this map is going to produce the same
result as the previous one 1 times 1 is
1 2 times 2 is 4 3 times 3 is 9 16 25
but I didn't need to have my square
defined in advance this use of lambda is
sometimes called an anonymous function
because it was an important function but
we never actually gave it a name but now
here comes the real convenience I'm
going to show you a third way to make
that list that's even more natural than
the previous two this approach is called
a list comprehension you ask for a list
but instead of actually putting elements
in it you write out a little formula
here and then say that you want that
formula applied for every element in
some other list or collection so this is
saying for every X in 1 2 3 4 5 so X is
going to be 1 and then it'll be 2 then
it'll be 3 then it'll be 4 then it'll be
5 for each one of those put X times X in
the output list these formulas can be
arbitrarily complicated any expression
you like so here X is going to be hello
and then my and then friends and we're
gonna make a list out of the length of
each of those so that's going to be five
and then two and then actually you tell
me what's going to show up here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
