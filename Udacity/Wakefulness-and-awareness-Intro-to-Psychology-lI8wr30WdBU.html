dimensions of consciousness we have
wakefulness and awareness so we can be
awake which is exactly what it implies
how awake are we or are we asleep and
then we can be aware or alert this means
to what extent are we aware of both our
external surroundings and our internal
world meaning how we feel emotionally
like are we afraid excited or are we
aware that we're in physical pain such
as having a headache or perhaps a pulled
muscle and this is also being aware of
our cognitions so what it is that we're
thinking here let's look at this on a
diagram we have awareness and
wakefulness we can have minimal
consciousness meaning we're not aware or
awake which would be here this would be
an example of a coma or we could be
fully aware and awake you'd be up here
so this would be something like
practicing the piano maybe how about in
the middle of the continuum so moderate
consciousness thing about this have you
ever been asked a question by a friend
something like what is the name of that
restaurant we went to Fort OMERS
birthday last month you know that you
know the answer to that question but you
just can't bring it to the level of
consciousness that allows you to respond
appropriately most of us have had
experiences such as this
whether it's an acquaintance's name that
we should know we just can't remember it
the name of a restaurant or even a movie
that we've seen all of these are
examples of something called the tip of
the tongue phenomenon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
