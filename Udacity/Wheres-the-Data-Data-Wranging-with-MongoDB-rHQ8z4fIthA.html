think about the mechanics of this
problem first thing I'd like to know is
how do I go about requesting the data I
want from this website again I'm
thinking about how I get to a point
where i can actually do this
programmatically so most web browsers
give you the ability to actually inspect
individual elements of a web page so in
this case let's just take a look at that
selector and if we do that we can see
all of the options right here in the
HTML for the page and based on our
understanding of HTML we know that it's
these values here that we would need to
submit as part of our post request all
right the options for airports look very
similar so instead of looking at that
let's take a look at the data that's
here now a couple of things I want to
point out here before we actually look
at the HTML again one is that for any
given Airport this is reporting both
domestic and international flights for
that airport now in my case I'm not
actually interested in that distinction
I simply want to know arrivals and
departures so where there's a value in
both columns for a given month I'm
simply going to add them together so
this is one place where I'm doing a
little bit of reshaping of the data it's
also the case that I've got these totals
here in this column and then at the end
of the rows for any given year I'm
simply going to ignore those again a
little bit of reshaping okay so let's
take a look at these elements now as you
might expect these are laid out in a
table and if I scroll to the top I can
actually see that there's a class
attribute for this particular table here
and this is going to help me when it
comes time to actually parse this HTML
in order to extract the data so we've
looked at both how to go about getting
the values we're going to need to submit
in a post request in order to get the
data we need and then we've looked at
once that data is presented to us or in
this case to our program that's going to
be accessing the site how do we go about
finding that data and pulling that data
out of the HTML or at least where is it
located in the HTML file</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
