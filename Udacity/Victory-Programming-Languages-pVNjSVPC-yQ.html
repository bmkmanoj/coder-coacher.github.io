there's much more to learn in computer
science and the world this about wraps
it up for this class you should
celebrate here you can see happy people
and clearly there next to let's call
that a cake at least one thing we can
conclude is that while you've learned
quite a bit about computer science my
sketching skills have not improved at
all hmm this course was not easy this
course was not easy and I fully
acknowledged that in fact some of the
material that it covers is similar to
material covered in 400 level classes at
universities like Cornell or Berkeley or
the University of Virginia there's a lot
of deep stuff going on in here you
should really congratulate yourself on
making through it alive a legitimate
question is what comes next well there's
likely to be a final for this course and
perhaps some wrap-up surveys but if
you'll indulge me for just a moment here
at the end of the class let me make some
recommendations for what you might do
with your copious spare time I
personally recommend that you study if
you have the time philosophy until
you've covered epistemology what is true
how do we know things tricky free will
do we have it so unclear logic the
philosophy of science and what it is
like to be a bat and there's my bat
using echolocation and apparently with
the wings of a condor similarly I think
there's a lot to be gained by studying
cognitive psychology at least until
you've covered perception which is
magical consciousness which is perhaps
even more magical bonus points if you
know what it is and can tell me and the
Flynn effect just when we thought we
understood intelligence studies speech
or rhetoric until you've covered
persuasion and presumably made Captain
Wentworth proud is all persuasions self
persuasion you tell me you should
definitely investigate anthropology
possibly cultural anthropology and
gender studies until you've covered se
mide and Freeman Margaret Mead and have
a better feel for which behaviors are
socially constructed and which may be
essential I think you may find that a
larger fraction are socially constructed
then you would have believed you should
follow along with statistics until you
can avoid being fooled either by others
or by yourself you should spend some
time with religion and ethics until
you've covered the relationship between
unhappiness and unrealized desires how
do we become happy study physics and
engineering until you can explain how
microphone a radio and a speaker or an
headset all work spend some time
studying government until you have an
opinion about legislating morality and
also the relative importance of freedom
in equality they are both virtues worth
striving for ideally we'd like them both
if you could only have one read history
until you are not condemned to repeat
the mistakes of the past until you and
Santana are friends and finally study
life until you are happy they say
ignorance is bliss but they are wrong
all but finitely often wait what was I
saying earlier about statistics I never
mind and let me just conclude by saying
that it has been an honest pleasure
leading you during your discovery of
this aspect of computer science it's
rare that I can do something like
teaching this class that will leave such
an impact on the world thank you for
giving me this opportunity</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
