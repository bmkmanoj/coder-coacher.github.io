their color the short answer to this
question is that melanin a pigment is
deposited in the iris of the eye to give
the apparent color soon after birth
melanocytes the same type of cells that
confer skin pigmentation begin to
synthesize and deposit melanin pigment
now if we look at the iris here we'd
have to zoom in to see the melanocytes
here and there's a special structure
within the melanocytes out called the
mallanna somme that synthesizes and
deposits this melanin pigment now
normally the kind of pigment that's
produced is very dark pigment and if
there's an abundance of this dark
melanin and the cell layer is thick most
incoming light is absorbed in the eye
color will appear brown on the other
hand if there's only a little pigment
and a thin layer of cells then little
light is absorbed and the eye will
appear blue all intermediate shades
reflect variations on this theme the
amount of melanin produced combined with
the thickness of the cell layers
affecting how much light is reflected or
absorbed while eye color is polygenic
and affected by several different genes
oca2 or oka - plays the largest role
melanocytes with a fully functioning
ouka to produce a lot of dark melanin
pigment which results in brown eyes but
melanocytes without a fully functioning
ouka to produce almost no pigment
resulting in blue eyes when the ouka two
genes function is reduced by other
mutations various eye colors from blue
to hazel can result based on this I want
you to rank the following oco-2
variations on a scale from brownest to
bluest you're gonna use the numbers 1 2
&amp;amp; 3 to rank these 3 options one being
the brownest and 3 being the bluest and
2 being in the middle we could have two
copies of a silent mutation of oka - two
copies of a nonsense mutation in oka -
and one copy of a mutation in the oka -
promoter that reduces transcription
