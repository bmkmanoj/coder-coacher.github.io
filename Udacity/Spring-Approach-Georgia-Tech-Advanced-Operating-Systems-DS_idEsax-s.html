operating system is to adopt strong
interfaces for each subsystem what that
means is the only thing that is exposed
outside a subsystem is what services are
provided by that subsystem but not how
in other words the whole part of it can
be changed at any time so long as the
external interface remains unchanged so
that is what is meant by strong
interfaces and this naturally leads to
object orientation and they also wanted
to make sure that the system is open and
flexible and this is important if you're
an operating system vendor and you want
to integrate third party software into
your operating system you want to make
sure that your interfaces are open and
flexible and at the same time you want
to maintain the integrity of your
subsystems and that's why strong
interfaces are extremely important and
being open and flexible also suggests
that you don't want everything to be
written in one language you don't want
to be tied to a particular language for
implementing all the system components
and this is the reason that in spring
they chose to use IDL which is the
interface definition language and this
is from the oMG group there are ideal
compilers that are available from
several third-party software vendors and
what that allows you to do is you can
define your interfaces using ideal and
third-party software vendors can use
that ideal definition of the interfaces
and use them in building their own
subsystems that can integrate with the
spring system and the other part of a
spring approach is extensibility and
extensibility naturally leads to
microkernel based approach and that's
what you see here this is the structure
of the spring system and what you see
below this red line is
Springs idea of a microkernel and in
fact there are two parts to it there is
a nucleus which in spring is the entity
that provides the abstractions of
threads and inter process communication
among the threads and the kernel itself
is made up of nucleus plus
the virtual memory manager so if you put
these two things together the nucleus
gives you threads an IPC and the VM
manager gives you memory management and
if you remember back to our good old
friend lead case principle of what a
microkernel should provide you see that
what is below the red line is exactly
lead case principle that is the
microkernel is providing the abstraction
of threads and IPC and an abstraction of
memory and everything else is outside
the kernel all the things that are above
the red line are outside the kernel and
in particular I mentioned that spring is
Sun Microsystems answer to building a
network operating system because this is
the time when transitioning was
happening to services that are being
provided on the network and so they
wanted to go from an operating system
that runs on a single node to a network
operating system using the same
interface namely the UNIX interface and
so this entity that you see here which
is called a network proxy will see that
more of it in later discussion in this
lesson this is the entity that allows
machines to be connected to one another
all the ovals that you're seeing that
are outside the kernel provide different
services that you might need in your
desktop environment for instance an X 11
server is a display manager and you may
need ability to do shell level
programming and you need filesystem and
you need a way by which you can
communicate on the network meaning that
you need a protocol stack</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
