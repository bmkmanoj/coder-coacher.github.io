goal of GM s the most important
parameter in the working of GM s system
is age management because we need to
identify what is the globally oldest
page whenever we want to do replacements
and let's see how that algorithm works
and how it is managed so in any
distributed system one of the goals is
to make sure that any management work is
not bringing down the productivity of
that node in other words you want to
make sure that management work is
distributed and not concentrated on any
one node and you know in the GM s system
since we are working with an active set
of nodes over time the node that is
active may become inactive and a node
that was inactive may become active and
so on and so you don't want the
management of age information to be
assigned to any given node but it is
something that has to shift over time
and that's sort of the fundamental
tenets of building any distributed
system is to make sure that we
distribute the management work so that
no single node in the distributed system
is overburdened with that that's a
general principle and we will see how
that principle is followed in this
particular system so we break the
management both along the space axis and
time axis into what is called epochs and
there are two parameters that govern an
epoch one is T which is a maximum
duration of an epoch that is an epoch is
in some sense a granularity of
management work done by a node and that
management work done by a node is either
time bound maximum key duration or space
bound maximum m replacements so if in
the working of the system if m page
replacements have happened then that
epoch is complete so we go to a new
epoch there will be a new manager for
age management or if the duration T is
complete then again
The Epoch is complete and so we pick a
new manager to manage the next epoch and
we'll see in a minute how we pick a new
manager and T maybe on the order of a
few seconds and M which is a number of
replacements may be on the order of
thousands of replacements so at the
start of each epoch what happens is
every node is going to send the age
information to the initiator that is
every node is going to say what is the
age of the pages that is resident at
this node all the local pages all the
global pages the universe of all the
pages that exists at this node what is
the age information associated with that
and remember that the smaller the age
the more relevant the pages so the
higher the age the older the page so in
picking a candidate we are always going
to pick an old page to the place so
that's the age information that each of
these node is sending to the initiator
so in one sense it's set of pages and
two cents it's set of pages and so on
everybody is sending to the manager know
that I'm calling the initiator the age
information what the initiator node is
going to do is two things it's gonna
find out what is the minimum age of all
the M pieces that are going to be
replaced
remember that smaller the age the better
so what it is going to say is out of all
the pages that exist in the entire
cluster what are the oldest m pages that
are going to be replaced in the upcoming
epoch and for those m old pages out of
those m old pages what is the minimum
age so any page with less than the
minimum age are pages that are active
and they're going to survive this
upcoming epoch whereas any page whose
age is older than that minimum age is
part of this set of M pages that are
going to be replaced in the upcoming
epoch and those are the replacement
candidates that's minimum each so it
computes that minimum age and it also
computes given the minimum age and given
the distribution of the age demographics
coming from n1 I know out of these pages
coming from n1 what fraction of the
pages that belong to n1 are going to be
replaced in the upcoming epoch and that
is the weight parameter for this
particular node
for instance if it turns out that n1 has
10% of the candidate pages that are
going to be replaced in the next epoch
then its weight is 0.1 if n 2 is going
to account for 30% of the replacements
30% of the M replacements in the
upcoming epoch then enters weight is
going to be W 2 and so on so what does
initiator does is it computes this mini
age and it also computes the weight for
each one of the nodes and that's what is
sent back to each node so each node is
going to receive the men age and also
the weight for all I meaning each load
is not only receiving its own weight
that is its own fraction of the M pages
that are going to be replaced but it is
also getting the fraction of the pages
that are going to be replaced from each
of its peer nodes in the entire cluster
and we'll see how this information is
going to be used by each one of these
nodes and of course we don't know the
future how all that the initiator is
doing is it is saying that there is
expected replacement w1 is expected
share of replacement that's going to
happen in n 1 W 2 is the expected share
of replacement that's going to happen in
n 2 and so on and when the next epoch
starts actually that can be different
depending on what happens in these nodes
but that's the best that we can do is
use the past to predict the future
that's what the initiator is doing it is
using the past the age information that
got from all the nodes in order to
predict the future in terms of where
these m replacements are going to happen
what is the minimum age of the pages
that are going to be replaced in the
next epoch so that's what is being done
by the initiator</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
