two but not the third whether the first
could happen depends on what we mean by
hijacking a session so an attacker in
the middle could certainly replace this
with some other message instead of
sending the r value selected by the
client sending some other value and that
would make the server pick some
different key and then the message was
the server sends would be encrypted with
that key that means the attacker could
pick in our prime value that the
attacker knows and decrypt the messages
from the server it wouldn't allow the
attacker to hijack the entire session
though because the client messages would
still be encrypted with K not knowin to
the attacker based on this R value and
the attacker doesn't have the way to
decrypt this just a way to change the
key the server pics but that's a pretty
serious problem if the server sending
messages that the attacker can intercept
and decrypt so this is a problem and
what we'd like to do is change it so the
key incorporates more values that
couldn't be interfered with by the
attacker we'll talk about how to do that
next first let me talk about the other
answer that's true that the attacker
could easily force the client and server
to use a different cipher so in step to
the server responds with the selected
cipher and hash this is an unencrypted
message an attacker who intercepts it
could change these ciphers to something
weaker if the client supports the weaker
cipher the client has no way to know
that the server supports a stronger
cipher and will settle for the weaker
one selected by the attacker we'll look
at how to fix both of these problems
next the challenges we need to fix them
where these steps in the protocol don't
have a shared secret yet we need to
agree on the cipher and the hash
function before we actually establish
this shared key</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
