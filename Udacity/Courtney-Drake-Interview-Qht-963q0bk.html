product manager here at Udacity so thank
you so much for talking to us today
absolutely so the first thing I wanted
to ask was that there's this perception
for online education that it's very
disconnected and impersonal and does
that necessarily have to be the case I
don't think it does um and I would say
that's something that we have really
focused on Udacity is the research and
our experience with students that social
learning is more effective than not
social learning and so that's something
that we have really actually invested in
quite a bit especially this year I think
the challenge with social learning is
that you still want to preserve some of
the core benefits of online learning
like self pacing and students ability to
kind of have their learning schedule be
flexible around their life schedule and
so those kind of but up a little bit
against the ability to kind of connect
students and and have them really build
deep connections with each other when
they're not necessarily a synchronous
environment and so I think those are
those are some of the challenges but I
udacity we focus on a couple different
ways of integrating interaction and
collaboration into our online learning
platform the first way is through forums
and through forums that we've really
focused on like how can we help students
help each other and help them answer
each other's questions and share with
each other and share with a broader
community of students um but we turned
out that hasn't really been enough for
students to feel like they are in a
community especially when it's a sane
and agree community that's 500 plus
students it's really hard to feel like
I'm connected to those other 499
students and so what we've moved more
towards recently in addition to forums
is small learning communities that we're
calling teams and so when students sign
up for a nanodegree this is kind of
rolling out progressively um they get
matched up with a group of 10 to 12
other students who they then have a chat
room with through the course their name
under great experience and what we're
hoping will can happen through that is
they build a personal connection with
those that other students and that's
kind of their first point of contact if
they have a question is run it by my
team members if we can answer it
ourselves awesome and if not then we're
posting to the forums or we're going to
coach support
from Udacity um and we're hoping that
what kind of help with three problems
around social learning one is
accountability is feeling like there are
other people who care about my progress
and if I drop off that doesn't just
affect me that affects other people um
the other is just a level of engagement
I don't feel like I'm alone in third
pieces if I'm helping other people and
I'm teaching other people actually learn
more that way and so having those
connections or we can kind of have a
back-and-forth chat and exchange and can
actually deepen what I'm learning if I'm
if I'm the one who's the helper yeah
that makes a lot of sense I think that
exactly we just described then we try
and create in our ol mess classes with
we do it on Piazza right now at least
and if we exactly try and create that is
a lot of interaction among students and
very frequent interactions such that I
feel like there is a community here
present right now and if I write
something I'm going to get a response
yeah pretty quick and pretty targeted to
what I'm talking about I'm one
interesting thing that happens in the
OMS community is that the largest social
community around it is actually a
student-run community it's run by on
several students who created the Google+
community I think that creates a lot of
interesting ownership because because
the student-run it's not this kind of
thing that being handed being asked you
know play by your rules um is there
anything we can do when designing online
technologies or educational technology
in general to kind of allow room for
these kind of student driven communities
to emerge yeah so when we've we've
experimented with how do we help
students create small communities and we
when we've just kind of let them have a
free-for-all we found that they don't
it's like some students start it and the
really driven students will start
smaller communities and its really
awesome when they do that and we see
some great interaction but the norm is
not I'm going to start a community I'm
going to join a community on my own and
so we've actually felt like we needed to
give students more structure took for
most communities this is why we we have
facilitated this way of having them join
a team from the very beginning we say
here's this tell us your availability we
will put you in a team and then let them
go from there so we felt like we
actually needed to create that structure
and I guess we'll see if how the
ownership plays out there and even when
we've experimented with that saying
we're going to actually put you in teams
together we found that and
one student really steps up into some
kind of leadership role they kind of
fall flat and so where we've said okay
how would how do we scale really solid
community interaction if we don't
necessarily know who those students are
who are going to step up until
leadership role and so that actually
seated the idea for a guides program is
what we're calling it where we're
enlisting students who are farther had
in nano degree programs who have
graduated to come back and be a guide
for our teams so they're coming to
weekly sessions with those teams and
they're engaging and chat with their
teams throughout the week to really help
them foster a sense of community and get
to a place where they're really jelly
and can put you know carry themselves
forward on their own so that's something
we've just started it's pretty cool
because it is actually students who are
coming back into that fray and it's
actually really nice kind of
motivational piece to say like look at
this other student who is in the same
place I was three months ago and look at
all if I know and maybe they even have a
job already that I want to get
eventually so it's it's a nice piece of
motivation it's also a way for us to
kind of have feet on the ground and
what's going on and um and make sure
that those communities are healthy and
strong it actually sounds very similar
to what we do in the LMS program because
that's wheezes scribe is very similar to
TAS way yeah its illicit next semester's
TAS from the semester students so I
think it works really nicely when we
have a big group of very very good
students who are passionate about
helping who aren't just you know you
know crossing an item of a to-do list
but really enjoy helping out their
fellow students yeah that's when one of
the most inspiring things about the OMS
program is that we see a lot more of
those students who want to help each
other and want to come back and work on
it and contribute to the class so yeah
it's been very inspiring I'm sure it'll
work nicely yeah so one thing I've
noticed also is that we have a
stereotype that all night education is
impersonal and disconnected and then
like you just said that there are ways
we can actually you know come compensate
for that but are there times when the
online environment actually makes it
even better than it could be in person
do you think I definitely think that
there are times for sure and one piece
of it is the geographical reach that we
get with online learning is that we've
students who are connecting from all
over the world and that's that's a
really powerful experience or someone
who's never
before and if you're all in the same
place you don't get that kind of
diversity of perspective that you do
with a global learning community so we
definitely have that peace um the other
piece is that if it's less synchronous
and people are kind of learning on their
own schedules it means that they're kind
of available whenever and so we've
actually really leverage mobile for this
with the team feature that we were just
released where we have mobile chat apps
on both iOS and Android so if I'm I've
had this happen with my own team which
I'm participating in where I will be out
of Jenna or something and I see that my
team shots something and I can just like
pop back in and answer a question so
they can you pick what is nature of the
internet really i can get help sus or
help students can connect more
frequently with each other than just if
we're having a class once a week or
something like that it keeps the top of
mind and keeps the kind of communication
flow happening more easily yeah I agree
completely i think one of my experiences
being an instructor in this program has
been that I can sign on the piazza that
we use for our forums right now and in
five minutes I can interact with 10
different students I can come back an
hour later and do it again and in person
you really can't have that I have
frequency of interaction so the internet
really that kind of that perception is
24 7 available you know really changes
what we can do and how often we can
interact so I sure all right well thank
you so much absolutely happy to help</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
