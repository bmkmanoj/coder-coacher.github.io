argument it is worth remembering that
the intent argument is just that it's an
argument not a theorem or a principle or
a law and there are many things that
have come to violate the end-to-end
principle network address translators
which we'll talk about in the next
lesson violate the intend argument VPN
tunnels which tunnel traffic between
intermediate points on the network
violate the end-to-end argument
sometimes TCP connections are split at
an intermediate node along an end-to-end
path particularly when the last hop of
the Anton path is wireless this is
sometimes done to improve the
performance of the connection because
loss on the last hop lossy Wireless hop
may not necessarily reflect congestion
and we don't necessarily want TCP to
react to losses that are not congestion
related even spam in some sense is a
violation of the end-to-end argument for
email the end user is generally
considered to be a human and by the
end-to-end argument the network should
deliver all mail to the user does this
mean that spam control mechanisms are in
violation of end-to-end and if so are
these violations appropriate what about
peer-to-peer systems where files are
exchanged between two nodes on the
Internet but are assembled in chunks
that are often traded among peers what
about caches and in network aggregation
so when considering the intend argument
it's worth asking whether or not the
argument is still valid today and in
what cases there are questions about
what's in verses out certainly and what
functions belong in the dumb minimal
network for example routing is currently
in the dumb minimal network do we really
believe that it belongs
what about multicast mobility quality of
service what about Nats and it's worth
considering whether the end-to-end
argument is constraining innovation of
the infrastructure by preventing us from
putting some of the more interesting or
helpful functions inside the network in
the third course we'll talk about
software-defined networking which in
some sense reverses many aspects
of this end-to-end argument</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
