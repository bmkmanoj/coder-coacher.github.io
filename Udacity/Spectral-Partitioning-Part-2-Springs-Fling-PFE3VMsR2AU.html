spectral partitioning is that you can
derive it using the graph laplacian as
it appears in a particular physical
system imagine that you have a bunch of
sticks of infinite length let's suppose
the sticks are fixed meaning they don't
move this dashed line is just a
reference we're gonna measure distances
relative to the reference now suppose
each stick has a weight attached to it
and let's suppose each weight has a mass
of little m we're talking about a
physical system so the mass would be
measured in say kilograms and for
simplicity let's assume all the weights
have the same mass now imagine that you
connect these weights by Springs so then
if you take all the weights and you
displace them by some amount relative to
one another
the strings will stretch and the weights
will move up and down so what I want us
to do is study the motion of these
weights let's zoom in on one of the
weights now relative to the reference
line weight I will be displaced by some
amount at any point in time let's call
this displacement X sub I of T now in
physics 101 you would have analyzed the
motion of these weights using Newton's
laws and Hookes laws for Springs yard
did someone say Springs here's a quick
reminder Newton's law says that the net
force acting on an object causes it to
accelerate in linear proportion to its
mass Hookes law says that the force from
a spring is proportional to how much
it's stretched Hookes law holds if this
degree of stretching or displacement is
relatively small now if that all sounds
like a bunch of nonsensical mumbo-jumbo
don't worry I'm not testing you on
physics just hang in there with me and I
promise something neat will happen so
let's go back to this ice weight its
motion is determined by the net force
acting on it by Hookes law that force
will depend on how much the strings are
being stretched and in fact each string
will be stretched by the difference
between the displacements of the masses
so the right-hand side is just the sum
of these forces now rewriting the
right-hand side you'll get the following
notice the values of the coefficients so
the net force acting on a given mass is
proportional to the displacements of its
neighbors in fact I can rewrite this
entire system for all the masses
as a system of differential equations
let's define a vector X arrow whose
components are all the spring
displacements then the entire system of
differential equations can be written in
the following form I've used matrix
notation here to express the entire
system very compactly so does this
matrix look familiar
why it's nothing more than a graph
laplacian in particular it's the graph
laplacian for a line graph I know what
you're thinking okay foo duck what on
God's green earth does this have to do
with partitioning therein lies the neat
surprise start by asking yourself what
would the motion of this system of
weights and springs look like the top
plot is the displacement of all the
weights every weight is a dot and the
springs are the solid lines connecting
the dots the bottom plot will show you
the velocity of all of the weights at
the beginning suppose we give a little
kick to the middle weight so that its
velocity is one unit of distance per
unit of time and the other weights are
at rest with velocity zero that's how
you read the initial picture of shown in
the bottom plot so from this starting
point let's see what happens
notice how the springs are bobbing up
and down with a kind of wavy motion in
fact this motion can always be described
as a sum of fundamental displacements
which are basically sines and cosine
curve x' at various fundamental
frequencies or modes if you have a
background of music you know about
harmonics and harmonics are modes for
say vibrating strings now for this
particular spring system it turns out
that the fundamental modes are given by
the eigenvectors of the graph laplacian
in fact when we finally arrived at our
ultimate algorithm for spectral
partitioning you'll be taking a closer
look at the eigenvectors but more on
that later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
