is they'll create a dev ops team so
suddenly you have a devops engineer or
multiple and they're like what do we do
well well I read in the in-flight
magazine then we need to do the DevOps
so I went out and I hired a dev ops team
they're going to solve our DevOps
problems and that team shows up and the
rest of the organization knows where the
pain is they know how it came to be in
many cases and they have ideas about
where they want to try to create value
and then suddenly someone shows up and
they're like preordained there it's the
near the Neo you're the one you're going
to be here that you're going to fix it
right and that narrative is a terrible
narrative so that's the anti-pattern now
the language is all of the people who
have been living with the problem are
somehow not suited to solve it and you
like for sure that's a bad that's a bad
message right it will create structures
that will not serve to get the value
that you want so if you find yourself in
that situation where you have completed
the class you have all these skills and
you find yourself in an organization
where they're like okay little DevOps
bunny go and make everything better the
first thing that you want to do is you
want to speak back to the organization
and say that's that's not a thing I can
do but here are things I can do I can
partner with your developers I can
partner with your operations teams there
are skills that we can train their our
capabilities we can bring into the
organization but the first thing I need
to know is kind of where does it hurt
and how can I help</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
