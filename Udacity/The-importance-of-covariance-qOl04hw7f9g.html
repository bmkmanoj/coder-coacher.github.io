covariance we're gonna take a look at a
couple different stocks here these are
pretend of course so here's one ABC it's
gone up 10%
here's another stock GHI it's also gone
up 10% but notice it tends to zig when
ABC zags so it's not going in lockstep
with ABC finally here's our last stock
that we'll take a look at de F note how
it goes almost in lockstep with ABC so
three stocks two that moved together
very similarly and one that moves
opposite them sometimes yet they've all
provided about 10% return what is the
best portfolio we can build by combining
these three different stocks so let's
consider their covariance or how they
move together for a moment so a b c and
d EF move very similarly and if we were
to measure their covariance and this is
the covariance of daily returns which if
you're just looking at one stock versus
another that's the same as the
correlation coefficient of their daily
returns so 0.9 means that they move very
closely to one another now if we were to
look at the covariance of daily returns
of ABC and GHI we would find that they
actually have a negative correlation in
other words when ABC goes up GHI tends
to go down so they actually have a
negative correlation or a negative
covariance whereas a b c and d EF have a
positive covariance again now what's the
best way to blend these together so
let's consider a couple of different
portfolios which are just waiting on
these different assets let's look first
at one that is 50% ABC and 50% d EF so
what's that one gonna look like well
they both move very similarly
so this portfolio is going to track the
two of them together so the performance
of this portfolio is going to look
something
like this so that's fine it ends up
returning 10% just like the two major
assets that it holds but there's no real
advantage in blending these two assets
because it just has the same volatility
as each one of them by themselves so
what if we try something a little bit
different what if we take 25% of ABC 25%
of de F so that's going to give us this
same motion that we saw here when we
combine those two but we put the rest of
it in GHI so now we're combining an
anti-correlated asset with these other
two so what's this portfolio going to
look like well it's going to be a nice
blend of them with very low volatility
because when one zigs the other zags so
this portfolio will also have a 10%
return but look how smooth it is and
that's because we're blending
anti-correlated assets together so we
get the same return but lower volatility
than any asset by itself so all these
assets by themselves had significant
volatility but when we put them together
we reduce volatility significantly
that's the magic of what Markowitz
provided and we'll look a little bit
more at that in just a moment</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
