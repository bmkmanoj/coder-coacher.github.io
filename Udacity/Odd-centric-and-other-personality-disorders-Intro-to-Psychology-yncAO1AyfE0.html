and inflexible patterns of cognition
emotion and behavior and they generally
develop in late childhood or adolescence
and continue into adulthood now there
are three distinct clusters of
personality disorders there's odd an
eccentric personality disorders there's
dramatic and emotional personality
disorders and anxious fearful
personality disorders now we're going to
examine the first two in more detail
let's first start by looking at the odd
and eccentric personality disorders
first we have schizoid personality
disorder we see that people with this
disorder do don't want to be close in
any of their relationships their
reclusive emotionally aloof and
humorless they also want to live
solitary lives therefore we see them
engage in solitary activities they have
no interest in sex
they don't have close friends and they
don't seem to react to praise or
criticism from others another odd
eccentric diagnosis is schizotypal
personality disorder here we see these
individuals being isolated in a social
but we also see that they have odd
thoughts perceptual distortions and
beliefs and we may see that these people
dressed act or appear in peculiar or
eccentric ways and finally let's look at
paranoid personality disorder people
with paranoid personality disorder are
extremely suspicious and mistrustful of
other people in ways that are
unwarranted and not adaptive they may
often test the loyalty of their friends
and lovers because they believe others
are trying to harm them people with
paranoid personality disorder may be
regularly suspicious of their spouses
faithfulness even if there's no evidence
that the spouse has been unfaithful but
remember these are extremes of
personality so questioning the
faithfulness of a significant other
doesn't necessarily mean you have a
personality disorder remember you would
have to be extremely paranoid to the
point of it interfering with your daily
life to consider this a personality
disorder</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
