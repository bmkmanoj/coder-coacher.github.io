summarize what we've seen and there are
lots of connections between the
different things we've seen that all use
cryptography to solve problems so that
first thing we looked at was anonymous
communication and we saw how to do that
using onion routing which was the chain
of public key encryption we looked at
how to do voting using mixes which also
involved a chain of public key
encryption with the addition of audited
permutations we looked at how to provide
anonymous digital cash in a centralized
way this involved using blind signatures
but blind signatures posed the risk that
if you don't know what you're signing
that's a big problem so we talked about
the cut and choose technique to verify
the messages before signing the one that
wasn't opened and finally we looked at
Bitcoin that provides a way to do
decentralized digital cash this also
used a chain of public keys but unlike
Onion Routing and voting where we were
using chains of encryptions in this case
we were using chains of signatures and
we also saw how Bitcoin uses hash pre
images as a proof of work and having
proofs of work is useful for many other
protocols so all of these protocols use
a combination of asymmetric cryptography
and symmetric cryptography typically
involving hashing and there's a
tremendous amount of things that you can
build with just these primitives in unit
7 we'll look at a few more interesting
applications of cryptography and wrap up
the course I hope to see you there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
