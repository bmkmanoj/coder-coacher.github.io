implementation of access control and for
resources and you know requests for
these resources and we said well in UNIX
based systems resources look like files
so let's actually see how those
resources are used and you know what
kind of calls we make for accessing them
and what happens during those calls so
first of all of course resource has to
be created okay so the process that
creates this resource is the owner that
owner can have whatever set of access
rights they want to have in unix-like
system you probably know the number of
ways in which you can create a file for
example so once a file exists and we
want to access it you do what is going
to open the file okay so this is sort of
like prepping the file if it doesn't
exist then the file gets created when
you do that file has a name and mode
here says you know do you want to read
this file or do you want to write it or
you know execute it what are you opening
it for how do you want to access it you
know once a file exists the first thing
we do is open it when you open it the
operating system returns you a file
descriptor which is a small number and
we'll see how what the use of that is
but you know as a result we will see
that to be able to access or get you
know the data that's in the file write
it into the file we're gonna need the
files a descriptor so the descriptor
comes when you open the file you prep it
or get it ready for access so a system
call you make saying this is the file I
want access this is how I access it
operating system prepares the file for
access returns you this descriptor file
descriptor that you then hold on to so
if you want to read this file in the
read call this is another system call
that you have you have to go to the
system you specify what file using a
descriptive this is what was returned
here it's a small number so this could
be five for example if you're reading
you have to specify where the read data
should be put how much data are you
reading that's the buffer and and its
size so data is going to come from the
file where is this data well file we
know unless file pointer that points at
the next place from where data is going
to come and it's advanced as you read so
whatever data follows the file current
file pointer we're going to pull that
data place that in the buffer and that's
what the read call is going to
similarly there's a right call except
that the data flows in the opposite
direction so the data is here and then
it's going to go into the file and how
much data that's what we specify in this
call so you know open is followed by one
or more reader rights and when you done
you close the file okay
and once you close the file again the
the input here is the descriptor that
says what file that you had open before
then this file we are basically telling
the system is that we're not going to
need to access it any anymore so the
system can you know if you had set up
some data structures it can essentially
free those up at that point resources a
file users have UID we also talked about
the group ID and to access a resource
this is what basically have to go
through file exists how to open it then
they have to say read or write it and
then you close it if you forget to close
it in the process terminates it's
implicitly closed but this is how a file
gets used</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
