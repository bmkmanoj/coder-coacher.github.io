generally painful all right what we have
to do is you have to sort of take all
this crinkled stuff and then open it up
and layer it what you would see is
something that looks like this and bear
with me here okay what's happened here
is this here's your eyeball right there
this back area is v1 they're showing
this is on the inside this is on the
outside here's your nose here this is
this these are your visual cortex areas
here and if i were to peel it out so
take this brain and flatten it out okay
you would get a map that looks something
like this so this big area here is v1
that's this area back in here it wraps
around and then there these other visual
areas anything starting with a V is a
visual area and then it goes all the way
up and here's that some so this is
wrapping around this whole body right
here's that somatosensory the feeling
here's your motor cortex a whole bunch
of these other areas okay this is what
you would see all right but of course
this is just a drawing now I want to
show you a picture that's kind of cool
and kind of gross at the same time all
right and here's what we're going to do
and again PETA folks turn this off all
right you take an animal living animal
you immobilize its I by giving injection
that prevents the eye muscles from
moving the eye okay you put up a
flashing pattern that's in like some
rings that alternates sort of bright and
dark spots you turn that on but remember
the I can't move to the eyes fixing the
same point you then inject essentially a
type of radioactive substance into the
bloodstream that binds with sort of the
oxygenated red blood cells and the more
cells work the more oxygen they consume
okay so you can measure so this was like
one of the first ways of measuring the
activity of the blood cell of of a of
the brain cells by you have them do this
work for a while while this radioactive
tracers connected to the red blood cells
oxygen and what hap
is the blood cells that are doing a lot
of work build up a lot of this
radioactive material but of course you
have to get a picture of that
radioactive material and it's a very
thin little bit of material in a very
thin part of the brain so what you have
to do is what they refer to as euthanize
the animal so the animal is killed you
then very carefully unpeel its brain and
you can take a radiograph you can
actually measure you know you can think
of it as simply as putting the brain
that brain tissue next to a photographic
plate and the radioactivity makes an
image okay it's a little more to it than
that when you do that you get this
remarkable picture this one comes from
1988 so even though this is sort of very
fundamental work it's not all that old
okay and here is that what the animal
was looking at okay it's macaque all
right so here you can see the visual
stimulus the animal is looking at and
here is the that picture of its brain
and what's so cool is that this
structure is preserved this is what's
referred to as retinotopic mapping is
preserved within the cortex okay so when
you move a little bit in the retina you
move a bit in the cortex now it's also
really cool is that it is not one to one
in terms of how much cortical area is
devoted to how much of the retina in
fact the way it's drawn out is sometimes
refer to a log polar etc and again this
is where we've unfolded your your visual
field and you see that like this little
area 1 2 3 4 is looking at a lot on the
visual cortex and then this area out
here okay is much much smaller so you
use more brain real estate for that tiny
little area in the middle of your visual
field then use real estate for the big
air areas out here which also I mean yes
it makes sense because that's where all
the processing needs to be but the fact
that you can actually find this in the
actual tissue is
you know in some sense remarkable</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
