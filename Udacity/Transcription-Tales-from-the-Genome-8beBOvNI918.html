promoter region a sequence of DNA tells
proteins exactly where transcription
should start in a particular region and
we call this region the transcription
start site and at this point individual
RNA nucleotides are going to be brought
in and matched with the DNA one by one
and this will continue until we reach
the end of the gene so in a molecular
level you really get a feel for the
chemistry that's going on here and so
for us to really see what's going on at
this point we need to zoom out a little
bit more so if we take a look at the DNA
gene as a whole from start to stop this
is where transcription started and this
is where transcription end this was the
full length of the DNA gene that we
wanted to transcribe and eventually turn
into protein the RNA copy is actually
called an mRNA copy mRNA means messenger
RNA it turns out that RNA serves many
purposes in a cell and so there are lots
of prefixes for RNA that distinguish
what it can do and the most important
one for us is this messenger status
because the messenger means that it was
a copy made from a DNA gene and that's
eventually going to be turned into
protein we call this our mRNA or our
messenger RNA copy now you might notice
a couple of differences from our DNA
gene and our mRNA copy I've drawn these
images to be representative of some
distinguishing characteristics of the
process so I want you to tell me how
does this mRNA copy differ compared to
the DNA gene that it came from I'm not
going to give you any answers to choose
from just a text box I'd like for you to
organize your thoughts and try to answer
this question don't worry about getting
this right or wrong just look at the
difference between the gene and the mRNA
and whatever difference you notice I
want you to write it down in the text
box here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
