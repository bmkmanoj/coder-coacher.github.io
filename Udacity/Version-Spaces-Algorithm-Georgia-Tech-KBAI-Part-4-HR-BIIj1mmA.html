powerful idea and learning convergence
is important because without convergence
a learning agent could zigzag forever in
a large learning space we want to ensure
that the learning agent converges to
some concept characterization and it
remains stable this method guarantees
convergence as long as it is a
sufficiently large number for examples
we needed five examples in this
particular illustration for the
convergence to occur this convergence
would have occurred irrespective of the
order of the examples as long as the
five examples were there note that we
did not use background knowledge like we
did in incremental concept learning note
also that we did not assume that the
teacher was providing the examples in
the right order this is the benefit of
version space learning it is another
feature to note an incremental concept
learning we wanted each example to
differ from the current concept
characterization in exactly one feature
so the learning agent could focus its
attention
however in version spaces you can notice
that each success for example differs
from the previous one and many features
just look at the first two examples they
differ in many features in the name of
the restaurant in the meal and the cost
it is algorithm for the version space
technique we'll go through it very
quickly because we've already
Illustrated it in detail if the new
example is positive generalize all
specific models included prune away the
general models that cannot include the
positive example if the example is
negative special is all the general
models to include it prune away the
specific models that cannot include the
negative example prune away any model
subsumed by the other models note that
in the specific implementation area
version space technique that we just
illustrated there is a single pathway
coming from the most specialized concert
model and therefore there is no need to
prune away specific models in general
there could be multiple generalizations
coming for the most specialized models
and this might be needed</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
