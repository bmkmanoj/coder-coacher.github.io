fine Michael how are you doing I'm doing
pretty well thanks I'm happy to get a
chance to tell you about something today
excellent and what is it you're gonna
tell me about we're gonna talk about
regression like progression no
regression so let me tell you about
regression so we are in this section of
the class talking about supervised
learning and supervised learning and
supervised learning we're gonna take
examples of inputs and outputs and based
on that we're going to be able to take a
new input and predict the corresponding
output for that input right so this this
covers all of the things that we're
talking about in the context of
supervised learning right right now what
makes regression a special sub topic
we're gonna be talking about mapping
continuous inputs to outputs as opposed
to what was the other thing that we were
mapping what other kinds of outputs did
we think about well we had discrete
outputs and continuous outputs right and
so this is going to be the focus on
continuous so regression seems like sort
of an odd word it doesn't really kind of
fit for this often I think about
regression as so this is this is me
being all sad and sort of reverting back
to a childhood State and that's you know
that's in the psychological sense that's
what regression refers to but it turns
out that that's not what it means in
this setting but the story by which
those things became linked I think is
kind of interesting so let me tell you
about that okay so this is a picture of
you Charles okay I'll accept that you
can tell it to you because he's really
tall and you're you're fairly tall man I
know you don't think of yourself that
way but you think of everyone else's
being short which is really the same
thing fair enough
all right so let's say that this is
Charles let's say that this is someone
of average height just someone at random
mm-hmm so now let's pretend Charles that
you have children I do have children all
right so let's say that's okay but we
can just pretend and we want to ask the
question what would you expect the
average height of your children to be
would you expect it to be sort of you
know that's sort of Charles height or
average height or maybe somewhere in
between so let's um let's actually ask
this as a quiz</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
