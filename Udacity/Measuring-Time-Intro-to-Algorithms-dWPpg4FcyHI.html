have a way of comparing algorithms in
terms of the time it takes to run them
without actually having to go and do all
the hard work of running them instead
what we're gonna try to do is analyze
what the running time is in kind of more
of an abstract model of computation to
do that is very difficult to get the
exact timing information without
actually running it is something that we
probably can't do but we can make a
series of simplifying assumptions these
simplifying assumptions will allow us to
do an analysis that is more tractable so
here's some of the assumptions that
we're gonna make so we count a simple
statement something like x equals x plus
1 as something that takes one unit of
time and we're gonna count up the number
of units of time an algorithm takes to
run the second simplifying assumption
we'll make is that the time it takes to
execute a pair of statements or three
statements or ten statements in sequence
is the sum of the times that it takes to
execute each of the individual
statements so this ignores a lot of
issues that go on in the architecture of
the computer things like pipelining and
caching that make this actually not true
in practice but we're gonna hope that
it's a good enough approximation of
reality so measuring the time that takes
to run something like an if statement
we're gonna imagine that there's the
time that it takes to execute the
condition evaluation and then the time
that it takes to actually execute the
statement so this would be essentially
two units of time so it follows from
these assumptions that the running time
for a loop is going to be equal to the
time it takes for the body of the loop
to run times the number of times its
repeated the number of iterations so a
block of statements like this where I
takes on a set of values 0 1 2 &amp;amp; 3 and
prints each one will say that this takes
4 units of time because this unit
statement is repeated four times so
let's see if you're getting the hang of
this so here's a little quiz how many
units of time will this little block of
Python code take to run can fill in your
numerical answer in the box</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
