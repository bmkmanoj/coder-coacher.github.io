bristle a little bit when they take an
algorithms class because of the heavy
emphasis on mathematics a lot of us got
involved in computer science because we
really like doing stuff and not
necessarily doing math but nevertheless
I think there's a very strong case to be
made for the importance of mathematics
in computer science and an algorithm
design in particular I'd argue that
there's three natural ways that theory
stuff or math can really help one is to
just get you thinking clearly about what
it is that you're trying to accomplish
it's very easy when you're in the depths
of writing code to lose track of what it
is that you want the code to actually do
so just thinking formally about what
you're doing is something that using
your mathematical background can help
with and another thing that it can be
very helpful with is analyzing the
efficiency of what you've produced so
you can actually know where there are
spots where you could be doing a better
job and have the code be running more
effectively and more efficiently without
producing incorrect code so just taking
a moment to think a little
mathematically can be a huge win and
save you tremendous amounts of time
sounds very important right now this
notion of efficiency is actually very
important to think about what is it that
you want your program to do efficiently
do you want it to be fast in terms of
time do you want it to be efficient in
terms of the amount of memory on the
computer that it uses so it does its
work with as little memory as possible
these days more and more people are
worrying about energy usage other ways
of organizing your computation so that
is efficient in terms of the amount of
power that it uses the tools that we
develop in this course are going to be
useful across the board here but we're
gonna mainly focus on issues of time so
to get you thinking about algorithms and
how they work and what makes them
correct and how to make them more
efficient let's go through an example
together so here's a little bit of
Python code that I wrote it's a routine
called naive because I'm not telling you
yet what it actually is doing and what
it takes in is input are two integer
valued variables that are non-negative
and then it does some assignments and
recalculations and a while loop and it
runs for a little bit and then it
returns Z so what I'd like you to do is
take a look at this it's not very long
probably not completely obvious to right
away what it is that it's doing and I
encourage you to run this in Python give
it some example inputs and outputs see
if you can come up with a pattern for
what it is that it's doing and then
convince yourself why once you have a
hypothesis
as to what it's doing see if you can
figure out how you can convince yourself
that this program actually is computing
what you think it's computing and then I
want you to fill out the following quiz
so you can take this code and you can
run it for any particular value of a and
B but I want you to think about what it
does in general as a function of a and B
when you run naive a B as a return
whichever of A or B is the larger one
does it calculate a minus B or for that
matter does it calculate B minus a is it
calculate the sum of a and B does it
calculate the product of a and B</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
