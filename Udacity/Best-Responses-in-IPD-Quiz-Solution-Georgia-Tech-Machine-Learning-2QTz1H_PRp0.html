these answers are let's find out so
let's see we already worked out the math
on this so we know that for gamma
greater than 16 cooperating is better
than defecting in general so if I'm
going against someone who's always going
to cooperate then I should always
cooperate incorrect what yes so so we
didn't actually work that out what we
worked out was what to do if you're
playing against tit for tat if you're
playing against someone who's always
cooperating and is completely no no no
no no you're right you should always
defect because you're always gonna win
yes always gonna win you're gonna get 0
on every time step right right yeah no
that makes sense that's beautiful all
right what about always defect well if
you're always gonna defect you might as
well defect in to eat cuz we're just in
the regular prisoner's dilemma world
good all right so now we now we have
this at this other strange beast here so
our opponent is playing tit for tat so
we could always defect right but we
would do we get a higher score if we can
convince to protect to cooperate with us
for gamma greater than the sixth that's
right so that you should always
cooperate that is true however mm-hmm
what if we play tit for tat against it
protects you'll end up in the same place
yeah so that's just as good mm-hm and
that's that's kind of interesting if you
think about mutual best responses yes so
that's a strategy that a pair of
strategies where each is a best response
to the other there's it we have another
name for that to remember no you thought
you told us what it was yeah but I
probably use different words it's it's a
Nash equilibrium this is that's what a
Nash equilibrium is a pair of strategies
where each is the best response to the
other eat me there's no way that either
would prefer to switch to something else
to get higher reward and that makes
perfect sense you're in an equilibrium
and it is a Nash equilibrium okay so we
can use this little table here to
actually identify Nash equilibrium so
what would a strategy be so if one
player plays always cooperate then the
best response to that is always defect
mm-hmm but the best response to always
defect is always defect so always
cooperate is not part of a Nash
equilibrium right what about always do
versus always defect no it is so that's
an ash right because they're both doing
the thing that is the best response to
the other right all right this box here
always cooperate against tit for tat
that's not okay because if a player does
always cooperate it's always better to
switch to always to fact yep but check
this out if you are playing tit for tat
and the other players playing tit for
tat there's no reason to switch because
it's actually a best response at the
optimal thing to do and that works from
both players perspectives and that makes
sense so like you said check this out
and you've been using check box that's
very good so we're in this situation
where we have two Nash equilibria indeed
and one of these Nash equilibria mer is
cooperative which is the thing that we
were sad about or least that I was
feeling really sad about in the in the
last lesson the idea that man there's
just it's clear that they should just
try to get along you explain that you
can modify the reward structure and then
they would get along better but here it
turns out well know another thing you
can do is just open it up to the
possibility of playing multiple rounds
as long as you don't know how many
rounds it becomes possible to to have a
strategy that is best off cooperating
and is in fact in nash equilibrium isn't
equivalent to changing the reward
structure it's definitely related to
changing the reward structure it's a
particular way of changing it very
pathetic yeah because it's not true
anymore that we can do this in the one
shot case you have to be in the in the
repeated games setting right so you
change your reward structure to be a sum
of rewards but it's actually an expected
some of rewards and you don't know where
it is you're going to stop so I guess
you are change you change you change the
game you change the the rewards but in a
sort of very subtle way yeah the whole
game is different really yeah man you
change the game sometimes you gotta
change the game don't hate the game no
you are supposed a Thea don't hate the
player hate the game</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
