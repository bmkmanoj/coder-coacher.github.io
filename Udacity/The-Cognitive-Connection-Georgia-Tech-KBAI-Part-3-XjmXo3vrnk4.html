reasoning and human cognition is both
very strong and not yet fully understood
let us suppose that I were to ask you to
go find the weather outside you would
not jump out of the window why not you
would use common sense reasoning to know
that jumping under the window to find
the weather is not a good idea but what
is it that tells you not to jump out of
the window you use some notion of goals
the notion of context to decide what not
to do and what to do we use similar
notion of context in order to do natural
language understanding we could use
context to disambiguate between various
meanings of take can we use context also
to decide on what would be a good source
of plan so far we have been talking
about making common sense inferences but
physical actions what about the social
world you and I also make common sense
inferences about the social world around
us one possibility is that you and I
have a theory of each other's mind this
is actually called the theory of mind
theory according to this theory you and
I as cognitive agents ascribe goals
beliefs desires to each other and it is
this theory of mind that allows us to
make inferences about each other
including commonsensical inferences</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
