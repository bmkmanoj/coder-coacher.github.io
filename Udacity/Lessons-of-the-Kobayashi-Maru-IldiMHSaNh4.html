experiment can you share something about
that with us well we called it the
lessons of the Kobayashi Maru which is a
Star Trek reference for the audience in
the Star Trek episode it was an
unwinnable exercise and young cadet
james t kirk was forced or chose to
cheat on an unwinnable scenario and he
reprogrammed the computer and was able
to succeed in that exercise so we wanted
to put students in a similar scenario
with the intent of deliberately forcing
them to take on adversary mindset and
mind you the people that we did this
were government employees that typically
work 9:00 to 5:00 and they don't have
this mindset but they embraced it what
we asked them to do was to take a test
we weren't gave them very little notice
and we told them night before - and that
they were expected to cheat on the test
and if they were caught cheating then
they failed they weren't supposed to
study that eating Lud's allowed the
cheating was expected expected and and
the test itself was the first 100 digits
of pi so they had to recite the first
100 to does the fire actually write them
down it actually worked out really well
give you a couple of examples of the
creativity one of them created business
cards
well actually had a stack and came up
the next day before the Testament was
very proudly giving us their business
card the rest of the stack it turned out
had the answer written written on them
so this individual could have walked
around in front of us and given one to
every single student and given them all
the answer he chose not to but he could
have because he subverted our trust
another example was someone that we
allowed students to have soda cans on
their desk and they printed out the
answer and put it on the side of the can
and when we would walk around they we
put their hand over the answers and then
check the answers when our back was
turned and my personal favorite was a
student who'd take one of the books from
the course scanned in the back cover
loaded it in Photoshop and ghosted in
the answer printed it
trimmed it down and used hairspray to
tack it lightly to the back cover of the
book so it was is indistinguishable
unless unless you closely looked at it
so they've created a whole entire false
book cover but that's exactly what we're
looking for wanted to people to think
like an adversary look at really comes
down to trust where do you place trust
find those trust assumptions and subvert
them so in this case the Proctor was the
the security system in some sense so you
were proctoring all this time and they
were taking the test yes so when during
the test my colleague and I were
proctoring it and what was very funny
and granted we weren't trying too hard
to catch them cheating but as we would
walk around the classroom in front of us
we'd see the the students staring up
into the sky considering the seventy
third digit of pi and behind us we'd
hear rustling and and then I'd slowly
turn behind me were students
contemplating the sixty seventh digit of
pi or the eighty second digit of path
and then behind me I'd start hearing
rustling but it was it was really really
a good deal fun they embraced it I mean
I could go on it was just the innovation
was off the scale and and I but I
thought was useful and fun exercise yeah
absolutely I I think sort of so security
we say is all about sort of sumption
than guarantees and the assumptions have
to be about the nature of the threat
