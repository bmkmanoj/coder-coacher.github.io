know about creating notifications and
apps for Android wear but one thing we
haven't discussed until now is how to
show the time to the user well watch
faces are such an important feature of
android wear that we have a whole lesson
dedicated to it what's an Android wear
watch face a watch face is what's shown
when the screen is on and no other apps
are running it's what you'll spend the
most time looking at and the first thing
that others will see when they glance at
your watch it's visible all the time so
you can discreetly glance at the watch
face without touching or activating the
device it goes without saying that a
watch face should show the time which
faces can also be a highly functional
way to share concise timely information
for example a watch face could show your
next upcoming calendar event or the
weather or the current price of a stock
which faces are also a personal
statement of style we'd like to say that
Android wear lets you wear what you want
and nowhere is that more true than a
watch face the design guidelines will
discuss for where our framework on which
to build your creations giving you room
and support for creative expression and
artistic freedom</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
