its three inventors Ron Rivest Adi
Shamir and Leonard Adelman and one thing
you'll notice in cryptography is many of
the most important ideas are named after
groups of people we have diffie-hellman
we have RSA we have Needham Schroeder's
we'll see lots of other examples and
this is different from what we tend to
see in mathematics where most of the big
ideas have just one name and
cryptography is a very collaborative
process the way Rivest Shamir and
Adleman work together rivest and
schirmir came up with lots of ideas
trying to come up with ways to provide
this public key property and Adelman
would find the flaws in them and they
kept trying this and eventually came up
with one idea that Adelman couldn't find
any flaws in and that's the one that we
know today as RSA and RSA was the first
successful public key encryption system
it's also one of the most widely used
crypto systems and continues to be the
most widely used public key system today
the way it works is actually quite
simple we have the public key as a pair
of two numbers e and n where n is the
product of two primes the secret key is
a pair of two numbers the N is the
modulus which is the same in both the
public and the private keys the
difference is in the public key we have
E and the secret key we have a secret
number D to perform encryption of some
message M we raise m to the e power mod
n to port to perform decryption using
the secret key we have some ciphertext
which we raise to the D power mod n so
that means encryption and decryption are
the same functions just with different
powers that we're using depending on
whether we're using the public key or
the secret key so RSA is a very
important crypto system but it's simple
enough that we can fit the whole thing
on one screen or even on a license plate
and unfortunately the state of Virginia
the license plate don't allow you to
have exponents in them if you live
somewhere where your DMV allows you to
have exponents in license plates that's
great you can get a much better version
of this than I have so actually
understanding why it works and the
argument that it's secure require
understanding some more things and in
particular how we choose the values of e
D and and in fact we have to be careful
how we choose the message as well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
