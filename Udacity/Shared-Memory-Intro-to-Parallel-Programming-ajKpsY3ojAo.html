for clarity remember that I'm just
hard-coding the idea that there's 128
threads and therefore we're going to
operate on 128 elements of the array all
right and I'm going to skip all of this
sort of out of bounds check and
assertions that you would normally use
to make sure that you're not trying to
access a piece of memory that's not
there so once again we have a function
you shared memory GPU this function is a
kernel and we're going to pass in a
local variable which is a pointer to a
bunch of floats and this local variable
is a pointer to global memory that's
been allocated in advance I wanted to
come up with some code that actually did
something using shared memory and that's
why this this function is a little more
complicated than the examples you've
seen so we're going to declare a few
local variables that are private to each
thread a couple of indices will declare
this variable index just to be shorthand
for thread index X that's just to save
some typing and we're going to declare a
floating point variable called average
and another one called some and we'll
initialize some to 0 point 0 here's the
big example now we're going to declare a
variable that lives in shared memory in
this case it's an array again I've hard
coded at array to contain 128 elements
it's an array of floats and I tagged it
as being a shared memory with this
underscore underscore shared underscore
underscore deckle spec and remember the
whole point of shared memory is that
this variable is visible to all the
threads in the thread block and it only
has the lifetime of the thread block so
it doesn't exist outside of this thread
block every thread block is going to
have its own copy and sewn single copy
of this array that all of the threads in
that thread block can see I called it SH
underscore array the first thing we're
going to do is put some data in this
array I remember I've passed in this
array that's in global memory called
array and I'm basically going to
initialize the shared memory array to
contain exactly what's in a global
memory array and notice how i do it i'm
copying data from this array in global
memory to this array in shared memory
and I'm doing it with a single operation
how does this work every thread if you
look at this code every thread is
figuring out what its own index is ok
which thread it is and it's copying the
element at array sub index
into the element at shared array
sub-index
okay so since all of the threads in the
thread block will be doing exactly this
operation and since they will all have
different values for index when this
single line has completed in all the
threads then we'll have copied all of
the information in this global memory
array into our shared memory array okay
and the trick is that that operation is
going to is going to take some time
multiple threads are running they're not
running all at the same time so it won't
happen instantaneously we have to make
sure that all of these writes to shared
memory have completed before we go on
and do anything with that array and
shared memory and that's what the sync
threads operation is about you've seen
this before okay so we call our barrier
to ensure that all the rights to shared
memory have completed and now after that
barrier we're guaranteed that this
shared memory array is fully populated
so okay so every element has has been
initialized now and just to be doing
something I said well let's find the
average of all the elements previous to
this threads index so what we're going
to do is we're going to with this for
loop we're going to set I equal 0 and go
up and up to index which again is which
is the number of this thread and we're
going to accumulate all the variables in
the shared memory array up to this this
this index this threads index and then
after we're done we'll compute the
average which is simply equal to the sum
divided by the number of elements that
we tell we we add it up and then once
again now we need to do something with
that average and and what I decided to
do is to have every thread look at the
average that it just computed of all of
the threat excuse me of all the elements
in the array to its left if you will I
have the value in the array at this
threads index is greater than the
average that it just computed of all of
the elements in the array to the left of
this threads index then we're going to
set array for this threads index equal
to that average in other words we're
going to replace any threads who's who
are greater than the average of all the
threads to the left with that average
notice that I'm operating on array and
not shared shared array so I used this
shared memory array to do my averaging
and that's a good idea because remember
that
memory is is fast much faster to access
than global memory and so here every
thread is X is accessing a bunch of
elements in the array so it makes sense
to move this right first to shared
memories that it moves faster we'll talk
more about this later but now I'm
operating I'm making this change back in
the global memory array and that means
that that when is when this kernel
completes this change is going to be
seen by the host and it would also
potentially be seen by other thread
blocks other threads and other thread
blocks if there were any and then just
to sort of make a point here's a piece
of code afterwards that has no effect at
all because I'm going to set an element
of the shared memory array to 3.14 but
then the kernel completes nothing ever
gets done with that value that's sitting
in shared memory and since shared memory
has the lifetime of the thread block
this memory evaporates as soon as this
thread block completes so this code has
no effect and in fact will probably be
removed by the compiler calling a kernel
that uses shared memory is no different
than calling a kernel that uses global
memory right since all you can do is
pass in a local variable that points to
global memory if you've so allocated it
then you know what that what that kernel
does with its shared memory is
completely up to it and not visible to
the host code at all so this code
showing how to use shared memory is
identical to the to the code that we saw
up here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
