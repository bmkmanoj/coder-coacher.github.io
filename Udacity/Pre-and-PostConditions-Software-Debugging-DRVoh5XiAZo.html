assertions in tests in particular in
unit tests here assertions are being
used to check the results of a single
run namely the test run what we're going
to look into is assertions that are
integrated into the program code itself
where they check all runs at once a
classic example for the use of
assertions is a square root program in
the beginning when invoking square root
we want to make sure that X the
parameter is non-negative I'll skip the
actual computation of square roots here
because this is subject of another class
but before we return the actual square
root we want to make sure that the
square root actually is a square root
how do we do that well we square the
square root and check whether it's
identical to the original argument X
these two kinds of assertions form a
pair and both of them have very specific
objective an assertion that's being
called at the beginning of a function
and which checks the properties of the
arguments is called a precondition an
assertion which checks the result of a
computation before it's actually being
returned is called a post condition if
you have such explicit checks in your
code this greatly increases your chances
of quickly finding the bug because these
checks would be invoked every single
time that the function is executed and
if they don't fail you know that the
computation is actually correct which is
a good thing if you remember our
cause-effect chain as a succession of
program state where a defect introduces
an infection which then propagates to
become the failure imagine what happens
if you actually do have assertions in
your code that check large parts of your
of your state now imagine what happens
if you do have assertions in your code
that check large parts of your state or
whether they're valid or not suppose you
have an assertion that checks all of
this area every time a function is
invoked then you wouldn't see the
failure only at the last moment but you
would see the failure as soon as the
infection spreads towards if you have
another assertion that covers this part
of the state then you would see the
failure at the very moment it is
introduced which of course
also means that you can immediately
identify the defect that causes the
infection the earlier you see an
infection for instance because an
assertion fails the shorter the
cause-effect chain you need to
investigate also if you do have parts of
the state that are covered by assertion
and these assertions don't fail then you
know that the state in here is actually
not infected and so in your search you
can narrow down your search towards
those parts of the state which are not
covered by passing assertions and all of
this happens automatically with every
single run every single test run and if
you want so even every single production</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
