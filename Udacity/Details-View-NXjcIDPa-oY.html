lean back details fragment when the user
selects one of our movies we'd like to
bring it front and center and we'll use
the details fragment to do just this the
details fragment has three sections the
first is an overview row which contains
text fields like a title and author and
a description below that is an actions
row in our sample app we've used the
stat actions to watch a trailer and to
buy and rent movies these actions of
course are fully customizable finally if
you scroll down you can see a list of
related movies pretty cool right the
details fragment works in a similar way
is the Browse fragment in the previous
lesson it provides the smooth animations
and most of the functionality behind the
scenes all we have to do is add our
content to it the pattern is the same as
in our previous lesson first we create a
details activity class and its only job
will be to apply layout that contains
the details fragment as before this
layout does little else except specify
our details fragment but before we see
how that works let's look at how we can
start it up here I am back in the Browse
fragment when the user selects a movie
we'd like to show our details fragment
and to do so we're going to add an item
view click listener to the Browse
fragment in the on activity created
method uncomment set up event listeners
and let's see how that method works
let's look inside the item view click
listener we have two different types of
cards in our display and this listener
contains logic to handle each the
important part is that if a movie's
clicked we fire an intent to start up
our details activity class and we
include the selected movie as an extra
so we can retrieve it later from our
details fragment the second listener on
the Browse fragment is used to detect
when a user selects a movie these names
can be a little bit confusing so by
select I actually mean that a certain
card has focus a neat trick is that
inside this listener we can update the
background image of the Browse fragment
to reflect the selected movie to do so
return to on activity created and
uncomment prepare background manager and
set up event listeners let's run the
project now and see what we get here you
can see the backgrounds changing to
reflect the currently selected card
pretty cool right I won't go into the
logic of how the background manager
works but there is one note notice that
if i scroll very quickly the background
doesn't immediately change instead we
wait for about a second after card has
been selected before
adjusting the background this provides a
much smoother user experience now let's
see how to set up the details fragment
the pattern to set up this class is
pretty much the same as the Browse
fragment I'll focus just on the new
concepts and you can find more details
in the notes will start by populating
the details overview row which is a
class provided by lean back and this is
going to contain the title the author
and the description first we'll pass it
a reference to the selected movie the
details overview row will store this as
an object that we can access later next
we add actions the actions class is also
provided by lean back to respond when
one of our action buttons is clicked
we'll set up a call back later on first
it's important to understand the details
overview row will be presented by
details overview row presenter aren't
Java naming conventions just great
they're so concise this presenter
already knows how to lay out our actions
row because that's built into lean back
but we need to add our callbacks to it
here's where we do that and take a look
at how these are handled the most
important action starts up the video
playing activity via the playback
overlay fragment this is also provided
by being back and we'll see how it works
later in our lesson on the universal
media player last although our presenter
knows how to present actions we have to
tell it how to display our movie to do
so we create a detailed description
presenter this is a very simple class
which binds our movie data to the
details fragment one last new concept
our details fragment uses two different
presenters one for the overview row and
another for the related videos row and
by the way if you look through the code
the related videos row is built
identically to how a row videos was
created in the Browse fragment by using
list rose and a list propresenter we'll
need a way to collect these two
presenters into a single object adapter
before passing them to the Browse
fragment and to do so we'll use a class
presenter selector this is a simple
class that associates presenters with
the classes they should be used to
present like this once we create an
object adapter with our class presenter
we can add different types of objects to
it as long as it knows how to present
these classes and finally we can set
this object adapter as the main adapter
for the details fragment let's run the
project now and see what we get watch
what happens if you select an action now
here the playback fragment appears
pretty cool right now I know there was a
lot of code here in a few new concepts
but if you think about how much
functionality you got in return I hope
you'll agree that it's a good trade-off
and one last tip here we use the lean
back support library to build a catalog
browser but you could easily use it for
something else other than displaying
movies for example you might have cards
the display weather information as in
the sunshine app</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
