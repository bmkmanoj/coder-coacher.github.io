for its powerful pain relieving effects
both physical and psychological as well
as the euphoria
however tolerance develops to the
effects of heroin and that requires a
user to take more of the drug to produce
so similar effects in addition once the
heroin addict is physically dependent
when the drug starts to leave their
system they'll experience withdrawal
symptoms thus the life of a heroin
addict is a vicious cycle spent
injecting the drug experiencing effects
and when that starts to wear off they're
going to seek to find the drug again
oftentimes this results in criminal
activity in an attempt to purchase the
drug
now heroin is not used here medically in
the United States but other powerful
opiates are however although some people
do abuse the opioids it's important to
stress the value of these pain relieving
agents from a medicinal point of view
these are essential for managing
individuals who experience pain now the
opiates produce their effects by
interacting with our mu delta and Kappa
receptors and they act similar to our
endogenous endorphins and in Kathleen's
people often die from overdosing on
these drugs by respiratory depression
now I'm going to send it back to Lauren
and we're going to discuss the next drug
cannabis</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
