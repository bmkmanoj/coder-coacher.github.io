methods let's move on to constructors
you want to be able to create variations
of objects for example a car that's very
fuel-efficient or a car that is less so
in Java you use constructors to
initialize objects here is an example in
the body of the constructor we simply
initialize the instance variables the
first two here are set to a constant
value when a car is first created it has
not driven any miles and it's tank is
empty this instance variable is set to a
parameter that allows you to construct
cars with different properties here we
construct a car with 60 miles per gallon
the value 60 is passed into the
parameter variable and is then set to
the instance variable here over here we
construct a car with five miles per
gallon and again the five has passed
into the parameter variable and then
used to initialize this instance
variable a couple of things to pay
attention to when you define a
constructor note the name it's the same
as the class name the class is called
car the constructor is called car also
note that there's no return type at all
not even void the constructor is not a
method it doesn't return any value
instead the job of a constructor is
simply to initialize the instance
variables you can have more than one
constructor and you'll get a chance to
write one right now
here is our constructor in bluej you see
the statements that we had just before
together with a couple of statements
that set the car's picture now this
constructor always takes the same
picture to construct a car it would be
much nicer if we could specify a
different picture for every car so let's
do that
I'd like you to write another
constructor that takes two arguments the
fuel efficiency and the picture file to
be used go ahead and do that in the
coding environment and submit your
answer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
