come across earlier if an animal lays
eggs and it flies then it is a bird how
do you write this in the language of
logic given that there is a conjunction
here so this time we can have two
predicates again there is a predicate of
lays eggs coming from here the predicate
of flies coming from here and we can
denote a conjunction between them which
in the language of logic is often put in
this form now we can rewrite this
sentence in the following form if the
animal lays eggs and the animal flies
then the animal is a bird remember again
this semicolon here really is denoting
implication for now remember again that
in logic this really stands for an
implication considered a slightly
different sentence suppose in this
sentence was if an animal lays eggs or
it flies then it is a bird in that case
again we will have two predicates but
this time we'll have a disjunction
between them and the sentence would
become if animal is eggs or animal flies
then the animal is a bird and again this
is an implication let us consider with
our exercise in which we are learning
how to write sentences in the language
of logic it is under the sentence if an
animal flies n is not a bird so it is a
negation here then it is a bat how do we
write that in logic so I'm still in
cross-trained writing the antecedent of
this particular sentence and I may be
able to say that animal flies there is a
conjunction here because it is an ant
here and we'll have this negation symbol
for this predicate bird now we can write
a complete sentence by saying that the
animal flies conjunction animal is not a
bird implies animal is a bat</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
