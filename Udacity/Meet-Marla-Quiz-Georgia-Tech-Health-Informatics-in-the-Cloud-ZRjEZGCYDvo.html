has become obese as she aged she has
also smoked cigarettes for many years as
a result she's developed several chronic
diseases through Marla and her story we
learn about chronic disease and the
problem it creates for the US healthcare
system will also gain the background
appreciate the key role health
informatics can play in helping solve
those problems first Marla is not
unusual the federal government's
Medicare program provides health care
for some 40 million people over the age
of 65 and pays for nearly half of all
u.s. hospital care it is projected to be
a major contributor to future increases
in health care spending eighty-three
percent of Medicare beneficiaries have
at least one chronic disease but the 23
percent that have five or more account
for two-thirds of Medicare's costs here
is a list of relatively common chronic
diseases so now you know what some of
them are I could have added cancer since
many people are surviving it and being
treated for years but we'll use this
list for now if you anyone in your
family or anyone you know closely have
had hypertension diabetes chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease heart
disease or chronic kidney disease check
that now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
