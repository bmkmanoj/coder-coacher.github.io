it we have not discussed before as an
example the exclamation marks indicate
these are implicitly unwrapped optionals
a concept and Swift that you'll learn in
the uikit fundamentals lesson in the
later part of the course let's break
down the audio recorder code piece by
piece you can see we first import AV
foundation the framework that has av
audio recorder without this import Xcode
won't know about any AV foundation
classes in our iOS app won't compile if
we scroll down to the record audio
function here we see what looks like the
code to get the directory path and build
a full path including the file name in
essence this grabs the pitch-perfect
document directory and stores it as a
string in the dirt path constant later
in this course when we get to
persistence you'll learn the various
directories and storage locations
available in iOS for now we just need a
place to store the audio recording and
the documents directory will work just
fine a few lines down we make an array
with a directory path and the filename
join those together and create a URL to
use with AV audio recorder we also print
out the path so you can see it in the
console next up we grab the a/v audio
session and set up the category to play
and record in order to either record or
playback audio we need an audio session
there's just one that exists for the
entire time your app is running and we
grab it with the shared instance method
the AV audio session class is basically
an abstraction over the audio Hardware
since there's only one audio hardware
there's only one instance of av audio
session you grab the shared instance
that's used by all apps on the iOS
device this is a common pattern you will
find in cocoa touch when you reach into
the iOS API and grab a singleton it is
usually a function called shared
instance so with the AV audio session
setup we can set up the AV audio
recorder here we see the line with AV
audio recorder inside of a try statement
without handling if it fails we will
cover error handling later in this
course for now we can just assume it
will work we tell
to prepare recording and start recording
that's it
av audio recorder is now recording audio</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
