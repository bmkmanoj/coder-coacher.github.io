let's delve into optimization making
programs faster and remember that we can
only apply an optimization that is we
can only replace one subtree of a
program with another if we don't change
the semantics the meaning the answer of
the program so here's another way to
look at the challenge of optimization
what we really want to know for
optimization is given two functions F
and G do they both compute the same
answer for all inputs this may seem a
little abstract but let me firm it up
with a concrete example it might be that
F is the original program angie is the
candidate optimized program if they
compute the same answer on all inputs a
then we can replace F with G wherever it
occurs so we can imagine framing this as
some hypothetical procedure optimization
ok you just pass it in F and G and if f
of a is equal to G of a for all a then
you return true otherwise you return
false now this is clearly sketchy code
we sometimes call this pseudo code
because it wouldn't actually work in
Python but you can imagine what would go
there somehow we're going to try this
out maybe we'll look at their source
code we apply these rules that we did
previously maybe we test it out on a
bunch of inputs somehow we come to the
conclusion that F of a is always equal
to G of a if so we return true and the
optimization is ok otherwise the
optimization is not safe so we don't
apply it so just to give one more
concrete example we expect optimization
ok of F and G to return true but
optimization ok of x and y down here
where x is a divided by a and y is 1
this should return false because
remember if a equals 0 then this one is
division by 0 exception in this one is
one and those aren't the same thing all
right so here's the actual quiz I've
written for statements for claims that
refer to that optimization ok phrasing
or procedure from before it's kind of
like a specification here they are we
can implement optimization ok so that it
returns a safe answer for optimization
in all cases for all possible programs
we cannot implement an optimization ok
that works precisely in all
cases it's undecidable like the halting
problem we cannot implement an
optimization ok that works precisely for
any case it's undecidable like the
halting problem and then down here
optimization ok of George F will betty
Friedan implies optimization ok of betty
Friedan George F will check all that are
true</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
