without being able to drink milk with my
cookies unfortunately today we have the
ability to digest lactose products even
if you're lactose intolerant some
companies actually sell a product which
is lactase in pill form you don't make
lactase no problem they'll try to
provide it for you in a bioactive form
to help you digest that lactose
essentially what it does is puts a
lactase in your stomach to digest the
lactose so that the bacteria in your gut
doesn't have to do it and you don't have
to get those side effects so let's take
this scenario Miriam is lactase
non-persistent meaning that she shows
signs of lactose intolerance after
hanging out with some friends they
decide to go out for ice cream which has
lactose in it so she wouldn't be left
out mariam took a lactase pills so that
she could enjoy the ice cream with her
friends without all the side effects of
lactose intolerance so I want you to
tell me which of the following
statements apply to Miriam make sure to
check all statements that apply</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
