publishing first a peer creates what's
called a torrent which contains metadata
about the tracker and all of the pieces
of the file in question as well as a
checksum for each piece of the file at
the time the torrent was created now
some peers in the network need to
maintain a complete initial copy of the
file those peers are called Cedars now
to download a file a client first
contacts the tracker which provides this
metadata about the file including a list
of seeders that contain an initial copy
of the file next the client starts to
download parts of the file from the
cedar once the client starts to
accumulate some initial chunks hopefully
those chunks are different than those
that other clients in the network that
are also trading the file have at this
point clients can begin to swap chunks
as clients begin swapping distinct
chunks with one another the idea is that
eventually after enough swapping
everyone gets a copy of the complete
file clients that contain incomplete
copies of the file are called leechers
the tracker allows peers to find each
other and it also returns a random list
of peers that any particular leecher can
use to swap chunks of the file previous
peer-to-peer file sharing systems used
similar swapping techniques but a
problem that many of them faced and
which BitTorrent solved is called
freeloading where my a client might
leave the network as soon as it finished
downloading a copy of the file not
providing any benefit to other clients
who also want the file</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
