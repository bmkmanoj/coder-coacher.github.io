respond to stress
well physiologist by the name of hans
selye a studied this and he discovered
that there were in fact three distinct
phases to the stress response there's
the alarm resistance and exhaustion so
in stage one of the stress response we
have the alarm stage and in this stage
we're exposed to some kind of stress or
stressor and our body responds two ways
first the sympathetic nervous system
releases catecholamines and secondly the
adrenal glands of the HPA axis releases
cortisol now and this is our body's
preparation to deal with the stress but
long-term exposure to cortisol
compromises our immune function as we
saw with poor Susan
so bodies can't handle being in the
alarm' stage too long we either die or
we cope and if we cope we enter stage
two called resistance and in resistance
cortisol is still being released
throughout our bodies and this cortisol
helps activate us arouses us and
maintains a response now long-term
arousal though is not good for our
bodies as we'll see here more in a
minute so in the third and final stage
we have exhaustion and in the exhaustion
stage what's going on is our body's been
trying to fight this threat for such a
long time that we become depleted of its
resources and we have no ability to
fight off illness because our immune
system is compromised in fact I'm sure
many of you have gotten sick during
finals that's due to exhaustion and
lowered immune response</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
