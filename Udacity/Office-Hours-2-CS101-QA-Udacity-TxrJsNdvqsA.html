question and that is what are they
allowed what are students allowed to
talk about related to homework questions
on the forums and outside of two other
students this is a good question it is
great to see all the discussion on the
forms we do want students to be able to
discuss questions on the forms to
provide hints if people get stuck what
we don't want is people to give up the
actual answers and for you to be
submitting homework swear you didn't
understand it or solve it yourself yeah
so I I am on the forums often as many
people that post on the forums know I
often comment and answer questions and
things like that I do look very closely
at the questions related to the
homeworks and I remove anything that I
deem over the line I've been really
impressed so far with students kind of
policing themselves and restricting
themselves not giving away answers I've
been really impressed usually where I
draw the line is step-by-step solutions
kind of start one do this tips to do
this or a general idea framework for how
to solve the problem and the other thing
that's over the line is posting code
that just has the answer and so here's
how you solve it that's that's no good
in general though I don't really want to
please form that strictly I won't
encourage students to have a
conversation and talk about the problems
and help each other through them okay
great and I think that really is the way
that you learn if the problem is hard to
start getting some Hill hints how to get
started but still to work out the
solution yourself and using the forms to
do that is a great way to learn more and
to be able to understand the homework
problems</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
