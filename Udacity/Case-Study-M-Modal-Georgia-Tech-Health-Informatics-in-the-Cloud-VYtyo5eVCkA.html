developing an early earmark the data
collection problem was already clear in
fact for the most part our physicians
dictated notes that were transcribed
into the EMR I used to tell visitors
that someday voice recognition would
make this far more efficient and
accurate as that day arrived to answer
that question will look at m modal one
of the most advanced medically specific
voice recognition technologies as shown
here it not only translates voice to
text but it recognizes clinical concepts
in that text and can code them into
icd-9 or sno-med here 3469 is the icd-9
code for a migraine headache 6 to 9 7
2009 is actually the sno-med CT code for
an extraction showing that at least at
the time this slide was made which was a
number of years ago the system was not
exactly perfect because there is
actually a better sno-med CT code that
is specific to wisdom tooth extraction</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
