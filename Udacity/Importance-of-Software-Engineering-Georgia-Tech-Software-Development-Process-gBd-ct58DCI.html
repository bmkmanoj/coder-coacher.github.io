very natural questions that you may have
when considering whether to take this
course the first one is what is software
engineering and the second very related
one is why do we need it so what I did
was actually to go out and ask some of
the main experts in the field both in
academia and industry these very
questions and let's see what they said
what is software engineering and why is
it important okay can I start with
another question
of course okay first what is a computer
it's a programmable device so the
essence of computing is program so
program development is basically the
most essential use of a computer so
software engineering is the discipline
that investigates program development so
how can it be done more efficiently
what's the best way of doing program
development and how can you develop
reliable programs so that's all define
but I consider any software development
activity software engineering activity
software engineering is the systematic
application of methods to build software
in a rigorous way and I think one of the
aspects that I like to bring into the
notion of software engineering is that
it's something that involves not only
kind of technically building the system
but understanding the requirements
working with stakeholders trying to find
a solution that balances all of the
stakeholders needs in order to deliver
the software in a way that's tested and
it's rigorous to meet the needs of the
stakeholders well the software
engineering is the whole process of
creation of software using engineering
principles my view is kind of a holistic
view and I think about it from the
perspective of how is software
engineering different from programming
so I think that research about
programming is all about the create part
of software and that software
engineering is about the entire
lifecycle so that's one aspect and the
other aspect of the definition is
it's about quality the quality of
software software engineering even
considers things long after you ship
which we all know is it is the largest
economic piece of software development
so improve software engineering process
for better software productivity and
quality the set of activities that one
engages in when building software
systems or software products it's
fundamentally the venue crazy activity
it involves social processes so for
engineering is a act of many people
working together in putting together
many versions of large and complex
systems and our world depends on
software software is immensely complex
and you need many many smart people to
notice me well engineering I think is
the activity of envisioning and
realizing valuable new functions with
sufficient and justifiable confidence
that the resulting system will have all
of the critical quality attributes that
are necessary for the system to be a
success and software engineering is the
activity of doing this not only for the
software components of engineering
systems but for the system overall given
that it's so heavily reliant on its
underlying software technologies so I
mostly software engineering is the art
and practice of building software
systems self-regenerating in a nutshell
is a set of methods and principles and
techniques that we have developed to
enable us to engineer or build large
software systems that outstrip or
outpace one engineers or even a small
team of engineers ability or abilities
to understand and
construct and maintain over time so it
requires a lot of people requires a
long-term investment by an organization
or a number of organizations and often
times it requires support for systems
that are intended for one purpose but
end up getting used for many additional
purposes in addition to the original one
I'm software engineering is about
building and constructing very
large-scale high quality systems so the
high quality is the issue twenty ring is
our engineering discipline of developing
software based systems julien embedded
into larger systems compose of hardware
and newman's business processes
processes in general and why sighing
water
because software is pervasive in all
industry sectors for our systems must be
enabled safe and secure why can't we
just get that by sitting down and
writing software well you could if
software was simple enough to be
developed by one or two people together
in early but software development now is
distributed involves teams of people
with different backgrounds you have to
communicate with each other it also
involves customers clients users
suffragettes and walkers or engineers
with Dominic's and therefore well known
care
and stop Tony engineering is mostly
being able to program and you need to be
able to put big systems together so that
they actually work that's my simple
definition if you don't use software
engineering practices you're not going
to be able to put them together well
you're not going to be able to rely you
can put them together so basically you
can maybe hack something up but it's not
going to necessarily stand the test of
time if somebody wants to change it that
probably gonna break and it's important
because if you don't think about how
you're building the system and how
you're trading off different aspects
like performance and scalability and
reliability then it's going to end up
breaking or not lasting very long or not
not doing everything that you want
or being really expensive if it's not
done in a principled way will be bad and
every user will suffer that's why we
need software engineering why it's
important because I mean these two
growth productivity faster into the
durable software and higher quality
would be apparently important because
you for me is everywhere
it's important because we use software
in everyday life everything's built on
software systems and these are
ubiquitous across our society it's
important because software is everywhere
around us and the way we build it and
the way we maintain it is something that
determines almost the basic quality of
life nowadays and getting that software
right can make a difference oftentimes
between a really fun product and one
that you won't like to use a reasonably
successful company or one that fails and
in more extreme cases even the
difference between life and death
if you think about the software that
runs in the airplane on which many of
you fly on a regular basis there are
programs that were that if they screw up
we are also looking software engineering
is crucially important because it's the
engineering discipline that is uniquely
capable of carrying out the engineering
mission for software reliant systems in
the u.s. we've all seen an unfortunate
example of a system that went badly
wrong in health health care Govan that
system wasn't engineered correctly and I
think if we look at the reasons for that
they stem back to somewhere at the
intersection between requirements and
architecture and politics and project
management and all of these things are
important concepts that have to go into
the software engineering mix it would
end up in lots and lots of care
because people would know how to
organize themselves and wouldn't know
how to organize software many of
software engineering is very simple
rules that you need to apply properly in
order to get things done and people look
at these rules and thing these rules are
so super simple this is totally obvious
but once you try to apply them you find
out they're not objects at all now that
we heard these experts let me show you
an example that illustrates what can
happen when software engineering
practices are not suitably applied
