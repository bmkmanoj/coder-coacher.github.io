note when you're in a hospital
correlated with whether or not you died
but the truth is the example emitted an
important variable the sickness that
Izzie's itself and in fact the sickness
did cause you to dying and also affected
your decision whether you go into a
hospital or not so if we draw arcs of
causation you'll find that sickness
causes death and sickness caused you to
without going to the hospital and if
anything at all once you knew you were
sick being in a hospital negatively
correlated with you dying that is being
in a hospital made it less likely for
you to pass away given that you were
sick in statistics we call this a
confounding variable it is very
attempting to just omit this from your
data and if you do you might find
correlations in this case our positive
correlation between the hospital and
death that have nothing to do with the
way things are being caused and as a
result those correlations don't relate
at all to what you should do so let's
study another example</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
