influencers for word-of-mouth marketing
so for example Aldi has this test-drive
campaign that offered to influencers in
San Francisco they basically invite all
those opinion leaders in different
factors of the industry to come in and
test drive one of this newest model and
get a sense of how they feel about new
model that's what all they do and the
Virgin America for example offer this
VIP service for those who are even just
a cloud user when they come to the
airport terminal the in vitals
influences over to their VIP launch just
for all the perks that they have there
because you know they think having a
cow's core is a good indicator of you
being in flash and Savia with this
social media thing that's coming up so
and people have different ways of using
cost scores across different domains
I've also heard of some dating sites
using called score as a signal to match
people up cool any other ways that you
can think of off the top of your head
some CMOS chief marketing officers is
cloud to just filter their candidates
with because you know a lot of the big
more traditional companies when they're
trying to adapt to the social media era
they try to hire someone with social
media background to be able to help with
their branding and brand picture of the
company and for those jobs having a
cow's core is a must
I've heard I think Barack Obama the
president has the highest class score of
99 and San Francisco Giants
interestingly after they won the World
Series they had a share that's the same
score for a month Wow and Justin Bieber
Justin Bieber has a very high class
score of 92 and a lot of celebrities and
media celebrities are wheezing their
range and that he's one of the
definitely one of the highest score</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
