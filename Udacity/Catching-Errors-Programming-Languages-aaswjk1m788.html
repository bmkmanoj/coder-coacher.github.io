perhaps we can catch or notice errors
and Python programs if we are very wary
and think that an error might happen we
can use the Python keywords try and
accept to guard critical code this code
is guarded and if an error happens in
here instead of aborting Python
execution it will go down to this except
block and start executing their this
except block only runs if the guarded
block has an error so this code will
print out hello and then we've seen
before that when we try to do integer
division by zero that doesn't make much
sense so we'll jump down here and print
out didn't work and then print out
problem which was our particular
exception and if you haven't run into it
before exception is just a special
computer science key word meaning and
error in a program it derives from
exceptional situation and can refer to
either something like you're out of
space on your disk or memory card or a
problem in your program like you're
trying to divide by zero however it's
also entirely possible to raise
exceptions on our own so here in this
Python code fragment we're printing out
Joseph Heller but in the middle we raise
this exception with value 22 and then
down here we catch that exception
calling it the variable problem then we
print out oh it didn't work we caught
problem and this will end up printing
out Joseph will raise the exception so
we'll never actually print out Heller we
will print out it didn't work we caught
22 and catch 22 is a satirical novel by
joseph heller it's a bit absurd the
phrase catch-22 is actually entered the
popular English lexicon meaning
approximately no-win situation</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
