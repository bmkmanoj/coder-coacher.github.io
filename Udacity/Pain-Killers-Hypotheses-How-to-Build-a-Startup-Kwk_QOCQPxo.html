about your product or service features
it's also about painkillers that is what
are you going to reduce or eliminate for
the customer so here's a couple of
hypotheses of what some painkillers
might be because painkiller until now
might have sounded like well women do I
hand the customers aspirin and the
answer is yeah you're really going to
solve a pain for them but the pain might
be is your product going to produce
savings that is in time or money or
efforts is it going to make them feel
better that is entertainment products
don't solve a problem but they saw the
need that does it kill frustration
annoyances or things that give them a
headache does it fix solutions they
already have but are underperforming
because you have new features or you're
better or faster or does it end the
difficulties and challenges that
customers encounter every day does it
make things easier or help them get
things done or eliminate resistance does
it wipe out or add to negative social
consequences loss of face power trust or
add to social status like Facebook and
Twitter etc or even LinkedIn or does it
eliminate risk is it financial social or
technical risks or what could go very
wrong
so painkillers your hypotheses should
include which one of these or some
others because this list is finite there
might be other things you're solving and
taking away pain from customers but you
need to be able to articulate based on
your interactions outside the building
with customers here's what they said and
when I bounced our product off of them
they said yeah and that really solves
this pain and more importantly is an
important pain</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
