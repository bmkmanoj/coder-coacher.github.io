content-based filtering what about IP
blacklist well first the way an IP
blacklist works is that when a sender
sends an email to the receiver the
receiver sends a query for that IP
address to a blacklist or a DNS base
blacklist sometimes called a DNS BL such
as spam house depending on whether or
not that IP address appears in the
blacklist the receiver can then decide
to accept the message or if the IP
address turns out to be on the blacklist
the receiver can decide to terminate the
connection and not even accept the mail
in the first place thereby saving the
operator the trouble of even having to
store the message the third approach is
to filter a message on how it is sent in
particular we can look at such features
as the geographic locations of the
sender and receiver the set of target
recipients the sender's upstream ISP or
our inference as to whether the sender
is a member of a botnet or a network of
compromised hosts that are doing the
bidding of some command and control
server and the challenges of building a
filter around this notion is first
understanding network level behavior and
second building classifiers using
network level features to execute the
filtering</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
