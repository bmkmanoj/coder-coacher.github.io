test and this might be something huge
like the Linux kernel there might be
something really small like a new square
root function that we really it's in any
case what we want to be able to do is
draw a box around the software that
we're testing now in general the reason
that we implemented the software is to
provide some sort of a service that
we're going to use another software
whether we're gonna provide to a user
and what that means is the software
under test is providing some set of
api's that's just stands for application
programming interfaces and all this
means is the software under test is
going to provide a set of function calls
that can be called by other software and
of course that's what we want to be
testing so for the next little while
let's assume a really simple piece of
software under test let's assume that
it's just a square root between that we
have implemented and we want to make
sure that it works so to test this code
all we're going to need to do is pass
values into the software so here we're
calling square root and routine with
nine as an input and see what it returns
see if it returns the thing that we
expected so let's just take a quick quiz
here if I call a square root routine and
here let's let's assume that we're not
talking about the Python square we're
just talking about a general square root
function that we're implementing for
some hypothetical piece of software so
we invoke the square root routine with
nine and what's what should it return so
here we're going to make a multiple
choice exam and you should enter into
the text box all of the examples all all
of the answers that apply so answer a is
three answer B is minus three and go
ahead and please write your answer in
the text box</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
