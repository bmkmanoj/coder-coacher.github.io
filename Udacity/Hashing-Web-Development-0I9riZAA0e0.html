technique called hashing and hashing is
a technique we can use to verify the
legitimacy of our data so what is what
is what is hashing what is a hash
basically a hash is a function let's
call it h that when you apply this
function to some data you get y know so
we'll say X is some data you know
basically you know it's ultimately a
number but you know as you know how data
is represented in the computer most of
our function will we'll be dealing with
string and it returns this value Y which
is a fixed length bit string usually you
know on the order of you know depending
on the algorithm 32 to 256 bits you know
are the are the the algorithms we'll be
dealing with it can be arbitrarily
length but that the kind of common
functions you'll be doing with basically
take X you know data acts of any size
you know some big long bit string and
returns a function or it returns a value
Y that is fixed length and and hashes
have a lot of uses and they have a lot
of properties too so let's talk about
some of the properties of this hash
function H okay so generally a property
of a hash function a good hash function
H is that for a particular value of y
for a particular output it's really
difficult to find an x that'll generate
that y you know there's it's it's very
difficult to find a piece of data that
hashes to something specific
likewise it should be infeasible you
know practically impossible to find a
particular input X for a particular
output Y so if we hash some value into
some you know other value Y we take that
other value Y and we cannot reverse this
this means it's a a one-way function
another property of a hash function a
good hash function is can't modify X
without significantly modifying Y and
generally you want if you just change
one bit in X which could be you know
thousands of bytes long you want Y to be
completely different and again this this
you know kind of hinges on some of these
other properties as well but basically
the whole idea is that for any
particular X you get a unique y-you
can't get the X from that Y and changing
the X just a little bit gives you a
totally unique Y so there's very little
correlation between x and y now each of
these properties has a vocabulary word
associated with it and some more
rigorous explanation and if you would
like to learn about those things you
should take CS 387 which is applied
cryptography and this is you'll learn
you'll learn about hashes to death we
are going to use hashes quite a bit in
this lecture because it's a really handy
way of verifying debt</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
