thinking after all both of these
paragraphs are equally original they're
both unusual and both give voice to
sentences that have probably never been
uttered or written before these writers
penned them so for something to be
deemed creative however it must not only
be original but it also must be useful
and adaptive and solve a problem James
Joyce's paragraph does that because it's
part of solving the problem of telling a
story the second paragraph is not
creative because it's not useful and
doesn't solve a problem by useful we
clearly do not mean pragmatic James
Joyce's novel was useful in the sense
that he was the first novelist to write
from the perspective of inside a
person's unconscious mind it has been so
esteemed and deem creative by experts
and readers of English literature
because it presented a powerful study of
unconscious human thought and emotion it
can be useful in a literary artistic or
aesthetic sense and that people are
inspired by it and make use of it in
their own creations the second quote is
equally original but does not solve an
important problem in any useful or
adaptive way by itself these phrases may
be interesting but together they're not
terribly coherent or were not made with
the intent of shedding light on the
inner workings of a human mind as was
Ulysses so creative thought and behavior
requires two things originality or
novelty of the thought and behavior and
that thought and behavior has to be
useful and adaptive solution to some
kind of problem so new forms of art and
literature architecture science
technology and business change their
fields the field is different after the
insight or innovation creativity changes
things for the better
of course the usefulness or originality
may not be immediately seen or
appreciated truly creative thought
behavior may be well ahead of its time
so the evaluation of creativity is not
limited to the here and now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
