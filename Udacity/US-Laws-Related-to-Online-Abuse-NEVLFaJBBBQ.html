particular malicious online activities
so things like theft and extortion of
course are illegal in in the physical
world we talked about data theft someone
hacking into your computer walking away
or siphoning off your sensitive data
using that to take on your identity so
identity theft getting access to your
financial accounts or getting credit
cards and things like that it could even
be extortion from locking up your
computer to doing a denial of service
attack saying your website wouldn't be
up unless you pay up you would think
those kind of criminal things that
happen in the cyber world we should have
laws related to those and we're going to
see that actually is the case in the US
the other set of laws have to deal with
copying and distribution of digital
objects so these digital objects are
essentially your intellectual property
it could be software it could be other
kind of content like music videos and so
on and if it's your intellectual
property we know that in the non digital
world we do have intellectual property
and we have ways to protect those and
the way we do that is through copyrights
or patents and trade secrets question is
do these also apply to when it comes to
digital objects that we access and
manipulate in the online world and if
there are we do need to have these kind
of laws how exactly do we apply them
there's something different about the
online world compared to the physical
world so how exactly for example copying
something could be extremely easy that
may not be the case in the physical
world so if you do have we allow someone
to copyright a digital object or
protected well how exactly the law will
be applied is a question that you might
have the other thing that we actually
not going to talk a great deal about it
is the idea of privacy we do a lot of
things online so our activities online
what exactly we do what websites we
visit what services we access what do we
search
for it's very easy to collect all kind
of information about these activities
these are my activities and somebody
else can collect information about what
I do are there any laws that protect me
in terms of what kind of information
could be controlled how could it be used
there are actually I said we'll get
through some of these but not all but
the idea with the privacy here is that
the Internet allows it makes it possible
at a scale and magnitude that we have
never seen before so the idea of Big
Brother for example somebody knowing
everything that you do is there
something in the laws to protect me from
that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
