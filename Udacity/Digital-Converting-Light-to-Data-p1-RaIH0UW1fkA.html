light is converted to data and look at
the digital process in parallel to what
we just looked at which was the process
for doing it for films the foundational
device foundational technology if you
will for converting light to data is a
CCD or charged coupled device it's an
electronic device that basically
converts electrical charges into a
digital value so in essence a pixel on a
output or that comes out from the charge
couple device or a CCD is basically our
different capacitors which convert and
store incoming photons as electron
charges photons are the ones that
basically have photoelectric value and
once they had these capacitors these are
converted into electron charges and it's
disk electron charge which is stored and
given a digital value it's important to
note here that dr. Boyle and dr. Smith
in 1969 while they were working at Bell
Labs and mented the concept of a CCD a
charge coupled device and of course they
were awarded with the Nobel Prize in
2009 and actually you know being person
who works in the photography field this
was an amazing piece of technology that
they have developed from 1969 to 2009
and of course it's one of the most
common pieces of technology in our homes
or businesses and everybody has one
nowadays is basically a camera that is
somehow the other related to this
concept of a charge-coupled device</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
