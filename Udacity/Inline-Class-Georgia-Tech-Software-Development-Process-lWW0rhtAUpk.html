is the reverse of the extract class
refactoring and note that this is kind
of a general situation in the sense that
it is often the case that the
refactoring also has a reverse
refactoring that does exactly the
opposite so basically undo in a sense
the operation of the other refactoring
in this case the motivation for the
refactoring is that during system
evolution we might end up with one or
more classes that do not do much in this
case what you want to do is it to take
the class that is not doing that much
and move its features into another class
and then delete the original class so
let's use an example similar to the one
we've used for the previous refactoring
to illustrate how this works here we
have in this case two classes person and
office and the person class is using the
office class but this latter class the
office class only contains a phone
number so it doesn't really do that much
what we can do is therefore to fold the
office class into the person class by
simply moving its only field into that
class and so the result will be this
person class that also contains
information about the office number and
overall a simpler design for the code</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
