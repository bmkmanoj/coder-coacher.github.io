little bit more carefully basically a
film is the whole process of how a
chemical process is used to convert
light and basically it is the energy of
the light itself that changes the
chemicals and then of course we have to
figure out how to preserve that changed
in chemical process tube then basically
be able to store light into film here
I've just laid out a simple 35
millimeter film pretty much liked the
same one that I'm showing here and I
basically kind of now unwrapped it in
the schematic to show different parts of
a film so in this instance light is
coming in and if you notice anyone in
this one the light was coming in from
that side and that's what's the one that
was pointing to the optics the lens of
the camera the light comes in and of
course there are many different layers
let's just go quickly over them and see
what and what each one of them does
first layer is a protective layer we
need to be able to protect all of these
light sensitive hairs that are actually
going to exist of course in most types
of cameras line films like this we also
put in a UV filter the UV filter is
there to just make sure that the right
kinds of light and not damaging lights
are hitting the different types of
sensors ignore the are colors of these
types of things each one of them has a
different feature so the first one when
the light hits is a blue light layer
then a yellow filter is added to kind of
get the yellow light out green light
layer red light layer so again we have
green red and blue lights then there is
an adhesive which is put in there so
these are all very thin layers and of
course thickest one is dub film base
which gives it the structure and keeps
it stable so in essence all of this is
tied up in something this tin so it's
important note that not only in the in
the present days people can pack things
up in small things a lot of this packed
up into a very small thing there so in
essence a film is a sheet of plastic and
that's what I've shown you so far
it's coated with an emulsion that is
basically full of light-sensitive silver
halide salts which have been bonded by a
gelatin so in essence there are silver
halide salts inside the layers these are
the light sensitive ones that actually
store the light changes and then they're
variable crystals are all over the film
also that basically determine the
sensitivity the contrast and resolution
of the film this is where some issues
like IR so come in because this is where
all of that practical ability of how
sensitive that films is comes in</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
