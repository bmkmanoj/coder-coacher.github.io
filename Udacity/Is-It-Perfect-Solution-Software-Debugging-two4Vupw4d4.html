through the individual states of the
finite state machine you will find that
this input is not processed correctly
what we have in here in our input is a
character that can also be mistaken for
the end of tag in HTML markup a program
does not know about the special meaning
of double quotes so what it does is it
starts interpreting everything as HTML
but only up to the closing tag the
double quote in here is interpreted as
text input the greater than sign is
ignored even in non tag mode text is
doing just fine and the remaining HTML
markup is ignored so what we should get
as output is double quote through and
you can see that the output still
contains part of the original HTML
markup so this is the correct answer the
others all work fine let me demonstrate
this in the IDE since I am now having
double quotes in my script I use single
quotes in Python which I can also use to
delimit a string or of them if your
string contains double quotes use single
quotes as string limiters if your string
contains single quotes use double quotes
as delimiters if there's no quotes in
your string well feels free whatever you
like here's our input with the greater
than in double quotes we run the whole
thing we run the whole thing and we see
in that the output indeed contains part
of the HTML markup that is the double
quote is still in there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
