trinomial is 5y squared times 5x minus
four x two x plus one that was a pretty
tough problem how'd you do if you got it
right you are on your way to being a
factoring genius let's see how we got
this answer remember when I'm factoring
any polynomial I want to check to see if
there is a greatest common factor when I
look at these three terms I notice a
couple of things the first thing I
notice is all three terms have a y
squared in that case I should be able to
factor out a y squared the other thing
that I notice is that each of the three
terms is divisible by 5 so this
polynomial has a GCF of 5y squared when
i factor out the 5y squared from each
term what am I left with when i factor
out the GCF i'm left with 10x squared
minus 3x minus 45 y squared x 10 x
squared gives me the 50 x squared Y
squared 5y squared times negative three
X is negative 15 X Y squared and
negative 4 times 5y squared gives me the
negative 20 y squared after i factor out
the GCF I need to look at the remaining
polynomial 10 x squared minus 3x minus 4
now I have to factor this trinomial
remember when there's a coefficient in
front of the x squared variable you have
to multiply the coefficient of the x
squared variable by the constant term to
factor this polynomial I have to look at
the factors of 10 times negative 4 which
is negative 40 that add up to negative 3
there are a lot of different factors
that multiply together to get negative
40 but the factors that multiply
together to get negative 40 and add
together to get negative 3 are negative
8 and 5 negative 8 times 5 is negative
40 negative 8 plus 5 is negative 3 now
we need to rewrite the middle term using
these two factors when I rewrite
negative 3x using my factors i get 10 x
squared minus 8x plus 5x which gives me
the negative 3x minus 4 now i can factor
by grouping when i factor by grouping I
notice that the GCF of the first two
terms is 2x
and I have 5x minus 42 x times 5x is 10x
squared 2x times negative 4 gives me
negative 8x now this is an interesting
situation here I have 5x minus 4 and
that's what I want my second binomial to
be so what do i factor out there is no
GCF here well technically there is a GCF
but the GCF is simply 11 x 5 x 5 x 1
times negative 4 is negative for now i
see the same binomial in both places so
i can now factor that out don't forget
to bring along our overall GCF 5x minus
four x two x plus one that was a pretty
difficult problem great job if you got
it right if not maybe try it again</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
