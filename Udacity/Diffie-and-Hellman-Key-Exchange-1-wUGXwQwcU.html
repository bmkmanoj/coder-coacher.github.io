TV Hellman key exchange algorithm there
are two publicly known numbers a prime
number Q and the integer alpha that is
the primitive root of Q now suppose uses
a MP wish to exchange a key using the TV
Hellman key exchange algorithm user a
selects a random integer X a that's less
than Q and compute why a let's race
alpha to the power of X a and then mark
you likewise user be independently
selects a random integer XP that's less
than Q and then compute YB that is alpha
raise to the power of XP and then mark
you each side keeps the x value private
and then sends the Y value to the other
side because the Y value is transmitted
in fact it is public user a upon
receiving YB with computer key as Y be
raised to the power of X a mark you this
is actually the same as alpha raised to
the power of XP x XA then mark you
likewise user be upon receiving why a
computer key that is why a raise to the
power of XP mud kill which is the same
as alpha raise to the power of X a times
XP mark you that is both sides have in
effect computed the same key in other
words now user a and user B have a sheer
secret key furthermore XA and xB are
private and anniversary such as user see
only knows q and alpha which are public
and y and y b which are transmitted and
they are also public if the attacker
wants to compute the shear key he must
first compute the x value for example
the attacker must compute a discrete log
of Y be in order to get XP if the
attacker can compute the screen log and
obtain XP you can then compute a shoe a
secret key by using the Y a value
the security of the diffie-hellman key
exchange algorithm lies in the fact that
while it's relatively easy to calculate
the exponents modular a prime it is very
difficult to compute a discrete
algorithm for large primes such as q at
at least 300 digit long this task is
considered infeasible</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
