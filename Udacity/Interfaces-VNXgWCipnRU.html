interfaces each of the components that I
just mentioned exports some interface
which explains to the the client of that
component or the outside world how to
interact with it but capabilities it
provides in our case those capabilities
are what we call predicates there a set
of you think of them as tables in a
database these are predicates or tables
that are accessible invisible to the
outside world that clients could query
or update and as you see here even
though we have four different kinds of
components we only have two different
kinds of interfaces forecasts and
multipliers and this is by design what
that means is that I can as you see in
this example I can have multiple
components that implement the same
interface now what's nice about that is
components that implement the same
interface or plug compatible and layered
assemblies so I could actually build
different assemblies that use each of
these components each of these three
forecast components have just declared
put them together in different ways and
build a nice rich library of variants
just by putting those two you of
forecasters by putting those together in
different ways and and can you relate
this use of the term interface to its
use in other languages like Java yes
it's it's almost exactly the same use so
in Java interfaces you declare
signatures of methods that many
different objects would object so many
different classes could could implement
it's essentially the same thing here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
