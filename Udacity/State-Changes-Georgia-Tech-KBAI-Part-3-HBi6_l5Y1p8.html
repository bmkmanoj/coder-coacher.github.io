else is 30 enables common sense
reasoning so consider the sender's a
shook enjoyed eating the Frog so not
just so shocked ad Frogger shock enjoyed
it how do we make sense of this term
once again because the verb eat we may
have the primitive action for in just
here is Ashok as the agent frog as the
object and this time we'll have another
slot called resolved which shows what
happens when a shark eats the Frog will
call this frame a state change frame
where there was some initial state and
some state at the end of this particular
action the action of ingest so here
there's a sharks mood which is becoming
happy so show how would the agent know
that in this case the verb we're going
to key on first is eating instead of
enjoyed good point David so we can
imagine a different action frame for
feel because of enjoy being a feel the
agent is Ashok Ashok is the one hood in
the feeling and the object or the
feeling that is being felt is joy we can
still have a frame for eating and we can
relate those two frames so what specific
interpretation and a agent will make
this particular sentence will depend on
the precise rules that we are going to
put into these slots so that the AI
agent can make either this
interpretation or that interpretation we
will see another example of this
situation in just a minute</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
