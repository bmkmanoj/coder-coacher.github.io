retention effects in-app purchases this
graph shows the amount of in-app
purchases by the hour for the top 50
games in the amazon appstore right after
they've been downloaded so this gives us
a good idea of what a net purchases look
like for successful games over time look
at the initial 24 hours there's a big
spike and in-app purchases the first day
is often where players make the most
purchases in fact most games make about
eighteen percent of all their inept
sales from players buying items within
the first day but that leaves eighty-two
percent of in-app sales coming from
players who continue to buy over time so
even though this initial spike is
impressive these smaller purchases that
stay consistent are even more important
for your game to continue making money
these regular purchases also mean that
players like your game they are playing
your game every day and willing to pay
for it bit by bit the bottom line is
that the longer someone stays engaged
and plays your game the more money it
will make</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
