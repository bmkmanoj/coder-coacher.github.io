gonna need to build on this idea of a
joint distribution it's not gonna be
obvious right away what this has to do
with machine learning at all but I it's
gonna connect so just bear with me for a
little bit all right so to talk about
this concept what we're gonna do is look
at an example and the example that I
think might work that would be nice and
simple is the notion of storm and
lightning so here's a little picture of
storm and lightning and what we're gonna
do is say let's say on a random day at
2:00 p.m. you look outside and what I
want you to do is say what fraction of
the time is each of these different
possible combinations of things
happening so for example what's the
probability that you look out and
there's a storm and there's lightning at
the same time so what do you think on a
random day yeah random day at 2 p.m. and
we can be in Atlanta since that's what
you're familiar with is it summer
because it happens more often in the
summer
sure let's say summer um it's fairly
high at 2 p.m. let's say it happens a
quarter the time wow that's a rainy
summer mm-hmm all right now that's not
the only possibility though it could
also be that there's a storm but no
lightning right that happens more often
at 2 p.m. in the summer in Atlanta let's
say it's a point 4 Wow all right now
what's the probability that you look out
the window and there's no storm but
there is lightning maybe 5 percent and
what's the probability that you look out
and there's you know it's nice clear
there's no storm no lightning
coincidentally I pick numbers that made
it easier for me to subtract from 1 so
it's point 3 right and so these there's
oh these are the only four possibilities
we're saying and they so they have to
add up to 100% and so I yeah there had
to be 30 at this point so it's actually
more likely that there's a storm than
not according to what you said it's the
land in the summer at 2 p.m. there you
go all right so this is a joint
distribution and now we can actually ask
various kinds of questions about this oh
you know it would be a good forum for
asking a question I don't know I'm
looking at true quizzically nice using
the fact that we're in the same place we
are going to do a quiz</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
