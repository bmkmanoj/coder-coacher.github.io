the impairment of the function of an
important molecule called insulin
insulin is secreted by particular cells
in your pancreas and it regulates blood
glucose levels every time you eat
something your body has to say hey cells
eat the sugar take it into your cells
and eat it insulin is the signal that
tells your body to do that it tells your
body to take that sugar and use it well
type 1 diabetes results from the loss of
insulin producing cells or really just
the loss of insulin all together type 2
diabetes is different in that it's not
that you don't make insulin anymore you
don't have enough of it it's that your
body doesn't respond well to the normal
levels of insulin now the solution for
both of these types of diabetes is to
provide the individual with more insulin
either in the case where you don't
produce it now you'll be given insulin
so your body can respond to it and in
the case where your body doesn't respond
well you'll just increase the dose of
insulin that your body sees until you
actually have a response now in most
cases of type 2 diabetes clinicians try
and utilize other methods to regulate
insulin sensitivity such as improving
diet encouraging exercise and treatment
with insulin is typically a last resort
take a look at this map of the United
States of the incidence of type 2
diabetes there are only four states with
an incidence of over six percent of the
population with type 2 over just a 10
year period from 1990 to 2000 there was
a huge increase in the frequency of type
2 diabetes look how many states have
more than six percent of the population
with type 2 now today more than eight
percent of the total population of the
United States has type 2 diabetes and
over twenty-five percent of people over
65 have type two now there are several
studies out there about the heritability
of type 2 diabetes but in one analysis
for patients with an age of onset from
35 to 60 years of age they found a
heritability of point 69 twin studies
have revealed a seventy to ninety
percent concordance rate among
monozygotic twins and 25 to 40 percent
concordance among dizygotic twins and
although g was have identified more than
50
d genetic factors influencing risk each
one accounts for only a very small
fraction of the overall genetic risk do
you think there's a greater genetic or
environmental component to the
population variation in risk for type 2
diabetes I want you to check which one
you think is the answer and then tell me
why in this text box here remember to
include words and concepts that we've
learned about in this lesson like
heritability concordance and much more
really think about this question this is
a summary assessment to give you an idea
of what you've learned in this lesson
after checking a box and putting an
answer in save your answer in a close
place because we're going to need it in
