here but I'll talk about the one I came
up with if you came up with a different
one that might be right I'd like to see
it
we'll start by moving all the way left
and then while we haven't found what
we're looking for if the piece you are
looking at is blue you'll need to keep
looking move one space right else if the
piece to the right is blue
you should stop because you found it
else if the piece to the right is yellow
move a space right I think it's a good
way to start by moving all the way left
because that means the first time we
find a yellow followed by a blue that'll
be the leftmost one now as long as we
haven't found it we're going to keep
looking while we're looking if the piece
you're looking at is blue like right
here that means that we haven't found
what we're looking for yet and we should
move one space right otherwise that
means the piece that you're looking at
is yellow and if the one to the right of
it is blue so if we were right here
we're looking at a yellow the one to the
right is blue you would stop because you
found it but if you're looking at a
yellow and the piece to the right is
also yellow we haven't found what we're
looking for and we need to keep moving
so in that case we still move a space
right so the way that this would work on
this input is we would start all the way
to the left and we haven't found it yet
so we would look at the piece it's blue
so we move right we still haven't found
it so we look at this piece it's blue so
we move right we still haven't found it
so we look at this piece it's blue so we
move right we look at this piece it's
not blue so we check what the piece to
the right is the piece to the right is
not blue so we check if the piece to the
right is yellow which it is then we move
a space right okay now we need to check
again if the piece you're looking at is
blue nope else if the piece to the right
is blue yep you want to stop because you
found it so it looks like it works on
this input</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
