applications if we could build a
cryptosystem like this first well look
at a standard use of it to send private
messages this is what our goal was
initially for the symmetric
cryptosystems that assumed that we had a
shared key to begin with but now let's
assume that we don't so let's assume
Alice wants to send a private message to
Bob she doesn't have a secure Channel
and she doesn't have a key shared with
Bob but she does know Bob's public key
we'll call that K UB Bob knows his
private key that corresponds to the
public key that alice as well as anyone
else who wants to know knows his
associated with Bob so now Alice can
send a message to Bob encrypting it with
Bob's public key knowing that the only
one who can decrypt it is someone who
knows Bob's private key which should be
only known to Bob Bob decrypts the
message using his private key so now
we'll have a quiz to see that everyone
is understanding asymmetric
cryptosystems what correctness property
does this rely on here are the three
choices pick the one that this private
messaging system is relying on about the
E and the D functions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
