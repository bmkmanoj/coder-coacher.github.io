segments who are you building your value
proposition for what jobs do they want
to get done what pains do they want to
solve and what games do they want to see
and at the end of this what you want to
find is what's the archetype or person
of who you're building the product for
now the last time we talked about value
propositions but today we're gonna focus
on customer segments one of the
interesting things about customers is
that customers don't exist to buy you
actually exist for them and especially
if you're a technology startup that's
really hard because you always think
it's about your product and it's hard to
remember that it's actually about the
people on the other side who are gonna
buy and so one of the things you really
need to understand is who are they and
why are they gonna buy from you and one
of the goals of customer segments is
trying to understand the archetype or
the persona or maybe just the details of
who these people are and specific detail
you want to know where they live what do
they do what's their age are they in
urban areas or are they married etc and
why do you want to know that because it
will help you figure out how to not try
to boil the ocean by trying to get
everybody in the world to buy your
product but figuring out who
specifically is interested and why makes
it incredibly easy to sell and have them
want your product when you understand
who they are and what their motivations
are so that's why we spend all this time
talking about customers and customer
segments one of the things you'll also
see later in this lecture is that you
might actually have multiple customer
segments that is different types of
customers all interested in your product
they might be male 18 through 24 live in
urban areas but you might also have
women who live in the countryside 45 to
55 in some cases also interested and the
types of marketing or demand creation
you'll do to attract each segment will
be different but if you didn't know who
they were you'd be creating the same
type of marketing and in fact probably
not reaching any of them so let's take a
look at this in more detail</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
