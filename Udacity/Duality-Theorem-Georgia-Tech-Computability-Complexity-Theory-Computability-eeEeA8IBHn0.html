primal program over here trying to be
maximized and we have a dual program
over here trying to be minimized and the
obvious question is do they ever meet
well the answer is yes they always do
more precisely we state this as follows
in the duality theorem if either the
primal problem or the dual has a finite
optimal solution then so does the other
and the optimal objective values are
equal and if either problem has an
unbounded objective value then the other
is infeasible note that it is possible
for both the primal and the dual to be
infeasible
we'll start the proof by showing the
second part if either problem has an
unbounded objective value then the other
has no feasible solution so we'll
suppose that the primal is unbounded and
that Y is feasible for the doable well
by weak duality B transpose y must be at
least C T times X for all feasible X but
since the primal is bounded there has to
be an X that's larger and that creates a
contradiction the case where the dual
instead of the primal is unbounded is
analogous now we turn to the first part
of the proof and we want to show that if
either the primal or the dual has a
finite optimal solution then so does the
other and even more that the optimum
values are equal let's start with the
primal having a finite optimal solution
well that then implies that it has a
finite optimal basic solution by the
fundamental theorem of linear
programming let's let the basis be the
first M columns of the matrix a and
we'll divide up X and C in the usual way
remember that B stands for basic here
recall them from the simplex algorithm
that this vector R D which represented
the effects of moving along one of the
directions in X D had to be non positive
otherwise this basic solution wasn't
optimal
now we're actually going to construct a
solution for the dual we'll let Y
transpose B CB transpose times B inverse
and then from the non positivity of our
follows that why transpose D has to be
at least as great as C D transpose and
then we can show feasibility by arguing
that Y transpose a and we can just
rewrite that in terms of sub matrices B
and D or just by definition the first
part is just C B transpose and the
second part is this expression here
which again from our the fact that our D
is non positive is at most C B times T
well that's just our vector C and we can
see that Y does in fact meet the
feasibility constraints
moreover y transpose B that is the
objective function for the dual program
is equal to CB transpose times B inverse
times B but B inverse B that's equal to
X B and C transpose B times xB was the
value of the objective function for the
primal so these are equal and then by
weak duality it follows that our choice
of y is optimal</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
