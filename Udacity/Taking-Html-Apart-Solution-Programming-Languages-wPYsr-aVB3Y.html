one starts with a left angle bracket
which looks super promising but then it
has this / which we don't see reflected
up here so this one doesn't match could
not have produced this sequence of five
over here we have a left angle bracket
Abby right angle bracket look in great
solve a door looking good dolly looking
great oh yeah this totally matches down
here we have almost the same sentence
but there's no space between Salvador
and Dolly this is very close but instead
of getting two separate words at the end
it would break down into just one word
at the end Salvador Dali so this one
doesn't match over here we start with a
bold tag have Salvador and then dolly
but then we have a few more characters
that aren't shown in this list of five
so this doesn't match exactly here we
have Salvador followed by the bold tag
that's getting the order wrong and the
order of this breakdown is really going
to matter we really need to know the
order of words in a sentence super
important it is finally over here we
start with bold and we have Salvador
Dali again this looks great no problems
there notice the spacing was a little
different here we had a space between
the bold tag and Salvador here we had
kind of a space over here these spaces
don't matter very much Salvador Dali was
a spanish artist famous for his
surrealist paintings probably most
famous for painting the persistence of I
can't remember let's just go on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
