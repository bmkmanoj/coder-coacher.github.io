they're just procedures that have a
first parameter bound to the object
there are some things in Python that are
a little bit more magical than regular
methods and we'll call them magic
methods magic methods are like regular
methods except for they get called in
special situations the most magical of
all the magic methods is the one called
in it and it takes at least one
parameter that's the self object recall
that that parameter is always bound to
the object it can take more parameters
if we want doesn't need to and what's
special about in it is it's called to
initialize the object so let's add an
init method to our restaurant class and
it's usually a good idea to place it at
the top of the class so we have two
underscores on both sides and we're
going to take one parameter and we'll
take the parameter the name so that
means and it will have the object where
initializing itself and a name that's
passed in and all will do in the body of
an it is assign the name attribute to
the value name if we do this this will
ensure that all restaurants will have a
name attribute so where's the magic the
magic is that this method gets called
when we create a new object of the class
so let me show you that an interpreter
now before we defined in it we could do
this create a new restaurant passing a
no parameters and that would create an
instance of this type now we get an
error and the error we get is a type
error that says the knit takes exactly
two arguments and we only give it one
well doesn't look like we give it any
it's getting one implicitly which is the
self object but it expects to it expects
self as well as a name so let's give it
a name now we didn't get an error and
we'll see that McDowell's has the name
attribute defined as what we passed in
and I should emphasize the only magic
about in it is that it gets called when
we initialize a new object otherwise
it's just like a regular method if we
decided that a more appropriate name for
our restaurant would be mcdeez mansion
of meta meet well we could call the net
method passing in that new string
perfectly okay and
now our name has changed to this value
when I said it's perfectly okay I mean
that it's correct we don't get an error
from the interpreter but it's bad form
to do this if we want some of the code
in it to be used other than initializing
methods well we should define that as a
separate method it's confusing to call
it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
