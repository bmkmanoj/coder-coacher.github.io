put on a backpack on to this this insect
which basically controls its nervous
system so they can actually monitor and
move the actual biological beam in the
way that they choose and this something
that we should be kind of playing around
what's still or is this something that
at this point in our technology that we
feel like you know what we really don't
need as many biologically created
animals as possible we really should
start just focusing more on just purely
robots or should we kind of there or is
this kind of like a necessary hurdle
that we have to get over I mean we see a
lot with animal testing with makeup
products and things like that but yeah
I'm a robot perspective in my opinion is
slightly concerning right because you
starting to say well we're just going to
hijack this host and we're going to have
this host do whatever we want it to do
even though it's only physical being or
entity of some form there was a lot of
out pray over the crowdfunding campaign
for you know do-it-yourself mouse or rat
brain hacking chips or cockroach
cockroach hacking there are several
interesting ethical dilemmas and
elements in there when I see the fruits
of this research being used to allow
someone to use an embedded chip to move
a prosthetic arm when they've had no
movement then I think it's a good thing
especially when I put it into the
context of realizing that we still do
incredible amount of research on animals
you know we for cosmetics as you said
for reasons that seem far less
compelling but we kill a lot of animals
and we torture a lot of animals for many
reasons already what's the real
difference between putting chips in and
remote-controlling them but it raises a
couple of issues one is what's the end
goal of this and I think the reality is
we're starting to produce some very
small flying robots nowhere near is
fuel-efficient as your average insect or
bird but we're improving technologies
all the time so I think you can see a
future where we don't need to talk about
it being a hijacked organism it's purely
a robotic miniature surveillance device
is that okay for us to use something
that most people might not be aware of
and why would we do that and one of the
reasons for doing a lot of biomorphic
work in robotics is this interesting
two-way street which we learn so much
more about how biology works when we try
to build artificial systems to imitate
it and vice versa we then learn so much
more about how physical robotic
mechanical and electrical systems work
when we try to replicate how the
organisms work so robotics feeds our
understanding of biology which then
feeds our understanding of robotics and
this kind of feedback loop goes all the
way back to gray Walters tortoises in
the 50s and he was a brain scientist and
he built the first autonomous mobile
robots analog and they were like
following robots and they displayed a
very lifelike behaviors simply through
inner phototropic behaviors and what
inspired him was creating physical
modeling of the workings of the neurons
in the brain</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
