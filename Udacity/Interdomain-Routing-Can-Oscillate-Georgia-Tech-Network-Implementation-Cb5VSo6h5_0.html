oscillate indefinitely to see why
consider the following for a s topology
where each a s specifies preferred paths
presumably via local preference so each
a s prefers the a s in the clockwise
direction rather than the shorter direct
path now it's pretty easy to see that
there's no stable solution let's suppose
that we started off with everybody
selecting the direct path well in this
case any one of these guesses would
notice that it has a more preferred path
so for example a s one would see that
because a s 3 has picked the direct path
then in fact it could prefer 1 3 0 now
we enter into a situation where
oscillations can occur indefinitely
similarly here now a s 3 sees that it
has a more preferred path 3 to 0 so it
might switch to that in doing so it
breaks a s 1 s path 1 3 0 no longer
works so a s 1 has to switch back to its
less preferred direct path but now we're
in the same situation all over again
because now a s 2 s preferred path
becomes available via 1 so a s 2 now
reroutes
and a s 3 s most preferred path 3 to 0
no longer works so it must switch to the
direct path now it's very easy to see
that this oscillation continues odd
infinitum this particular pathology was
first discovered by virata and Govindan
and estrin in a paper called persistent
router oscillations in inter domain
routing in 1996 later Tim Griffin
formalized this pathology and derived
conditions for stability those stability
conditions came to be known as a BGP
correctness property called safety it
turns out that if a s is follow the
ranking and export rules that we
discussed that safety is guaranteed but
there are various times when those rules
are violated business relationships such
as regional peering and paid peering can
occasionally cause those conditions to
be violated so as it turns out to this
day bgp is not guaranteed
to be stable in practice and many common
practices result in the potential for
this type of oscillation to occur</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
