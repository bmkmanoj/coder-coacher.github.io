electricity we know that negative
charges like to be with positive charges
we know for methods to charge an object
and we've learned that the earth is both
a source and a sink for electrons but
one thing we haven't talked about at all
one of the most important concepts in
physics is energy so why don't we go
back to Professor fragran essay and see
what he has to say about energy as it
relates to electricity one of the most
evident effects of electricity are
attractions and repulsions of
electrified bodies and this is important
because you can use these forces to
produce work to produce energy we can
start understanding it with an analogy
with the gravity which is simple because
we have only attraction electricity is
much more complicated because you have
also this complication of repulsion if I
have a body of mass there is an
interaction between the body and the
earth and there is potential energy if I
drop this body it has the capacity to
produce some work maybe to break an egg
down down there it goes down and it the
potential energy diminishes and it
requires kinetic energy movement
velocity and which is proportional to
the square of velocity with electricity
is more complicated because of repulsion
but the idea is similar you can use the
interactions between electrified bodies
between charges to produce work and so
to have energy to produce something</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
