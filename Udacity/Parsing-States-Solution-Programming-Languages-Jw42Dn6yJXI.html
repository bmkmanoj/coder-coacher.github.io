their red dot right at the beginning and
it's coming from state 0 so this is a
state that will occur in our chart but
it occurs in charge state 0 similarly
this one is coming from position 0 we've
seen the a we haven't seen the answer to
be this one will be there but it's in
chart one and we're looking for things
in chart 2 s goes to nothing from one
and I haven't quite seen it yet this
won't be in chart state too because only
one input token is accounted for this is
still in charge state one ah but over
here this is looking very promising this
is saying oh where you've just finished
reducing s goes to see and there's one
more token before this that you haven't
seen here we're reducing s goes to see
and here's one token before this not
currently shown this will be in chart
state too now these last two really test
your memory of how we compute the
parsing States the charts and how we
keep track of this from information this
one looks very tempting as it goes to a
s dot B that's definitely where we are
in the input we're right before the B
but it says from one that means there
has to be one more input character that
we haven't seen ex-ac but that's not the
input we're currently seeing there's no
other hidden character that's not shown
here instead the one we really want is a
SB from zero this is the beginning of
the string there's an a.s goes to see
this is where we are now and we're
hoping to see Abby that's definitely in
chart to</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
