options to consider for example the
dispatch system has its own predicted
time of arrival the technician has their
own self-reported arrival time which
they write down as soon as they reach
the customer's home or we might use the
time of completion of the technicians
previous job all of these are valid
quantitative metrics to consider using
when capturing the question when will my
service tech arrive we decided as an
initial guess at a metric to consider
using the technicians reported arrival
time so the reason for selecting the
actual recorded arrival time is that it
seemed as close as possible to the
actual quantity we were trying to
predict so the computers predicted
arrival time is based on various
assumptions in addition as far as using
the time of the technicians prior
finished job time much can happen
between the end of the technicians
previous job and the start of the next
one so for this reason starting with the
text actual recorded arrival time seems
like a reasonable way to go having
selected a reasonable metric we then had
to determine how do we turn the
relatively vague problem statement when
will my service tech arrive into a
rigorous statistical inference problem</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
