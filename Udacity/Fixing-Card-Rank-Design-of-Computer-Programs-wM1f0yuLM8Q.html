almost right we say what card ranks does
it returns a list of the rank sorted
with higher first we pulled the ranks
out of the cards so here we're iterating
over the cards and we're having to
values the rank and the suit and what
this is doing is saying each card is a
two value element and we can break down
those two elements into the first and
second the the ones that has rank 0 and
rank 1 or our index 0 and index 1 and so
we're saying a card consists of a rank
in the suit and we're only going to
collect up the ranks and make that into
a list so that so ranks is the list of
ranks then we sorted it and we said we
want a reverse sort so that the higher
comes first rather than the lower and
then we return the ranks now this is
almost right but the problem is if we
just pull out the the rank of each card
as is then the rank T for 10 is the
highest because T comes alphabetically
after a and Q and all the other cards
but we don't want that instead we want
tend to map to the number 10 and J to
the number 11 and so on so we're gonna
have to come up with a way of fixing
that taking these letters that we pulled
out of the cards and mapping them into
an integer in the correct way and see if
you can fix this definition of card
ranks to correctly return a list of
numbers not a list of characters</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
