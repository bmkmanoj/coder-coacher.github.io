all of the elements in the list had the
same type we had a list where all the
elements were strings we had a list
where all the elements were numbers
there's no restriction on lists though
we can make all of the elements any type
we want we can mix and match different
things in one list so here's an example
so we've put some strings and some
numbers together in one list that's
perfectly okay where it gets even more
interesting is we can have a list inside
a list so now one of the elements of
mixed up is itself a list and we can
have another list inside that so here
we've defined a new variable mixed up it
contains a string a number a string a
number and then a list the fifth element
is itself a list that contains a number
a number and contains another list this
example shows the versatility of Lists
that we can put anything we want in them
doesn't seem particularly useful because
there's no structure to the things we
put in the list so let's try another
example that may give a better idea of
why it's so useful to be able to have
list inside lists before we defined the
variable Beatles as a list of four
strings just the names of the Beatles
now we've defined the variable Beatles
as a list of Lists where each element of
the list is a list of the name of the
person as well as the date when he was
born so we have the first element our
list is John who was born in 1940 let's
see how that works in the Python
interpreter when we start to have long
lists especially lists of Lists like
this they might not all fit on one line
it's okay to divide things into two
lines but we have to be a little careful
where we do the division to make it
clear the Python interpreter that it's
all part of one list so the place where
you want to do the separation is after a
comma and if you indent things in a way
that makes that clear then you can see
the structure that these two lines are
still part of the same list and it's the
closed bracket here that closes the list
so now let's try printing that out and
we see the list containing four elements
each element itself is a list containing
two elements
we can print just one of the elements
we'll print the element at position
three which is actually the fourth
element of the list so we see that
element itself is a pair that's a list
so if we want to get just the name from
that well then we need to use index
again so we can use index again to get
the zero position element of that list
and that will give us just the name if
we used index 1 here that will give us
the year</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
