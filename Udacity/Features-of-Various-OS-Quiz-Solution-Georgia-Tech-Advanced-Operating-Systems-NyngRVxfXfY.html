you protection no questions about that
and we also argued that it's performant
because of the fact that border
crossings are minimized and loss of
locality is minimized and and sources of
copying overhead are minimized all of
that add up to giving good performance
for a monolithic structure on the other
hand it's not easily extensible any
change to the operating system would
require rebuilding the monolithic
structure with the changed
characteristic of the system service so
one size fits all is what you get with a
monolithic structure a dart like
structure is performant because there is
no separation between the application
and the operating system and therefore
an application can execute system
services at the same speed as it would
execute a procedure call that is part of
their application itself and it is also
easily extensible because you can build
new versions of system service to cater
to the needs of specific applications
but on the other hand it fails on the
safety attribute because there is no
boundary separating the kernel from the
user space a microkernel based operating
system also pays attention to protection
because it makes sure that the
applications and the servers are in
distinct Hardware address space is
separated from the microkernel itself
and it is also easily extensible because
you can have different servers that
provide the same service but differently
to cater to the needs of the application
but it may have performance loss because
of the need for so many border crossings
that might be needed to go between
applications and the server processes
having said that I want to give a note
of caution on the surface it may appear
that the microkernel based approach may
not be performant because of the
potential for frequent border crossings
I'll have a surprise for you on this
aspect when we discussed the l3
microkernel later on in this course
module where it is shown that a
microkernel can be made performant by
careful implementation that's the key
I'll leave you with that thought
but we'll come back to a microkernel
based design using l3 later on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
