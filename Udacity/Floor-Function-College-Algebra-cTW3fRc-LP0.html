really taken off in fact he's been doing
so well selling these bulk packages that
he's only going to sell nozzles by that
doesn't know that does mean though that
depending on how many nozzles he has
total he might have some left over for
example if grant has 40 nozzles total
then that will make 3 and one third
packages of 12 nozzles since if we take
40 and divided by 12 we get three and
third then we can see these three whole
packages of 12 novels but then there's
this one third of a package left over
grant can't sell one third to a package
so this 3 and the third packages really
only counts as three for him so it's
almost as if for taking us three and a
third and rounding it down to the
nearest integer three so let's say that
x equals the actual number of packs of
nozzles we have so for example in this
case we have three and a third packs of
nozzles and let's say that y equals the
number of packs of nozzles that grant
can actually sell so in this case that
was three we can represent this
relationship between the actual number
of packages we have and the number grant
can sell by something that's called the
floor function also known as the
greatest integer function the notation
for the equation is this y equals x
inside these double square brackets
which basically means that the Y value
is equal to the greatest integer that is
less than or equal to the corresponding
x value but what do you think the graph
of the floor function looks like which
of these graphs do you think properly
represents the floor function remember
that we want the Y value to round X down
to the nearest integer I know that for
far away it might be hard to tell these
two graphs apart so below them I've
shown a blown-up version for you of what
each of these steps looks like please
notice the difference between the two in
terms of which circles are empty and
which ones are colored in</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
