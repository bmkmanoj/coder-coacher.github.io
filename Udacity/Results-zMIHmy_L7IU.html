results that you can get using that
alright so here are again this is taken
from the berkeley database and because
she and malik Shambo see and understand
malachi did normalize cuts and you can
see that there are some pretty good
results here you know you like
especially like this one here where it
breaks up the picture of the people in
in a particular way now of course these
segmentation is tremendously influenced
by that affinity matrix and the affinity
matrix is defined by that distance
function so we're back to feature spaces
again right we have to know what
features we should be computing a space
over we may have to scale the features
because all of that determines the
distances but once you do that and you
play with that you can end up with a
really powerful segmentation method by
the way you'll notice that there are
more than two segments in these pictures
well so how do you do that well the
simplest is you partition your graph and
then what do you do you partition again
partition again and you need a stopping
criteria based upon sort of the
affinities of the links that you're
cutting here are some more examples also
taken from the Berkeley database for
segmentation</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
