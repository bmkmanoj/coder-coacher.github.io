this polynomial right here 5x squared
minus 28 x minus 12 and because i know
that factoring polynomials that don't
have leading coefficient of 1 it's a
little bit tricky i want to take a
second to go more in-depth into the
logic figuring out what numbers belong
in our linear factors saying that a
polynomial like this one of degree 2 is
factorable means that we can write it in
this form as two linear factors or
factors with an X to the first power in
them multiplied together now the general
form of a linear factor is just like
this we have some coefficient times X
plus some constant term what we've been
talking about is how to figure out what
numbers belong here now of course one
way to do this is to factor by grouping
like we have been that entailed
expanding this middle term into two
terms that add together to equal it and
then grouping pairs of terms together so
considering this first pair as a chunk
and the second pair is a separate chunk
and pulling the greatest common factor
that we can out of either of those pairs
this is why we call this factoring by
grouping because we're grouping these
terms and grouping these terms we can
use a slightly different kind of logic
though to get to the same answer if
we've already written out the form that
we want the equation to end up in we can
look directly at what we might want from
these different coefficients and
constant terms based on what we start
out with we know that the way we end up
with this x squared term here is by
multiplying the term with an X to the
first power from each binomial in it
that means that whatever the coefficient
is here multiplied by this coefficient
must equal 5 we can write out all the
different factors of 5 we gather have 1
times 5 or we could have negative 1
times negative 5 now another thing we
know is that the two constant terms
multiplied together equal the constant
term in the original expression so we
can think about the factors of negative
12 as well there are a ton of different
ones here i guess i will write them all
out though just for your pleasure and
voila there we go I hope I didn't miss
any now we know that the way we get this
negative 28 the coefficient of the
middle term here is I multiplying
whatever this number is times this
number and then adding that to this
number times this number so that means
we're going to have either
five times some number plus one times
some number equals negative 28 or for
the other pair over here negative 5
times something minus 1 times something
equals negative 28 now since I'd rather
have two positive coefficients for X
rather than two negative ones let's just
select to use 5 equals 1 times 5 this
makes our job a lot easier because then
it only leaves one combination of
factors over here that we can plug in
you just have to figure out which one it
is and of course as you already saw in
the previous quiz we know that this has
to be negative 6 and this has to be
positive 2 I can fill in the
coefficients in front of the exes and
then since I know that the two outer
terms multiplied when we're trying to
find this middle coefficient I know the
negative 6 goes in this slot and the two
goes in this slot since the inner terms
are contributing to this as well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
