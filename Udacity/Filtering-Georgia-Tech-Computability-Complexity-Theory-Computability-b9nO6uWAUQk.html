reductions ie the ends have been
relatively uncomplicated they all either
accepted every string or they accepted
no strings
unfortunately reductions can't always be
done that way since the machine that
always loops and the machine that always
accepts might both be in or might not be
in the language we're reducing to in
these cases we need n to pay attention
to its input here's an example where we
will need to do this the language of
descriptions of Turing machines where
the Turing machine accepts exactly one
string it doesn't make much of a
difference which undecidable language
we've reduced from so this time we'll
reduce from the halting problem to this
single acceptance language again there
are many possible reductions I like this
one we run the input machine M on the
empty string if M loops then so will N
we don't accept one string we accept
none on the other hand if M does halt on
the empty string then we make n act like
a machine in this language s will have
it just accept the empty string
my favorite string this works because if
M loops on the empty string then n will
loop on every input and hence accept
nothing on the other hand if M does
halts on the empty string then n will
accept exactly one string the empty
string once again in one case the
language of n is the empty set in the
other case the language of n is the
empty string a decider for the language
s can tell the difference and therefore
would be able to decide if M halted on
the empty string or not since this is
impossible I decided for this single
acceptance language cannot exist</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
