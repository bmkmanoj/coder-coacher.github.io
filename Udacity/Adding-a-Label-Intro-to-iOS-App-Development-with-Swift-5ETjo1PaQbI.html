to show some text reading recording in
progress and I want this text to show up
right here right underneath the
microphone button to do this I will go
back to the standard editor there I see
my storyboard and then I will slide out
the utility area
let me Center my storyboard there now in
here I am looking for something called a
label let me actually go back to the
list view to see what it does there it
is it says a label is a variably sized
amount of static text which is exactly
what we need I'm going to drag this
label and place it right underneath my
microphone button there
let me change its text to recording and
then reposition it there now while the
label is selected I will go to the
attributes inspector and then begin to
change a whole bunch of things about
this label for instance I can change its
font I can pick a custom font this is
the font I like I can reduce the font
size you can make the label centerline
I can also change its color
and I will also go to the editor and
make sure that I select the size to fit
content option let me reposition this
one more time so it's right underneath
the button there alright I'm going to go
ahead and run this and see how it looks
all right we can see our label right
here although there seem to be a couple
of things that are odd with it one is
that it is not properly aligned it's not
lined up right underneath the microphone
button now this happened with this
microphone button also so we kind of
know a way to fix this and the other
thing that's weird is that this label or
text is showing up by default the
correct behavior would be for this label
to show up after we have pressed the
microphone button how would you fix
these issues here are the two things you
would want to fix with this label one
more time my recommendation is that you
search for documentation and then post
your responses on the discussion forum
once you're done select one of these two
options</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
