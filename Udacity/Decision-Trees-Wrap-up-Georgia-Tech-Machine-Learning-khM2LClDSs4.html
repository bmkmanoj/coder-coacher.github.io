decision trees excellent so since you're
the one who's listening you get to tell
me what we've learned today well we
learned about the decision tree
representation we learned the top-down
algorithm for inducing a decision tree
and we call that id3 all right so we got
a representation we got a top-down
learning algorithm id3 we learned about
the expressiveness and the bias ah so
there's two separate things we learned
about the sort of expressiveness and we
learned about the bias ninety three and
we gave one specific to ID three we
looked at one specific way of deciding
on splits which was to do this maximum
information gained rank so we talked
about in general what are good
attributes or what are best attributes
so information gain is one way of doing
it that's one example
and by the way this notion of best
attributes is something we'll end up
returning to sometimes explicitly and
sometimes implicitly throughout the
entire course and lastly I feel like we
talked about the problems with
overfitting and how in the decision tree
context you can prune back the tree to
avoid overfitting overfitting is an
issue overfitting is always an issue and
we came with a couple of strategies for
dealing with overfitting in the context
of decision trees okay
so we've learned everything there is to
know about decision trees there's
nothing else to know somehow I find that
hard to believe
yeah there's a lot there and the
students will get a chance to learn even
more as they do the assignments cool
excellent all right Michael thank you
sure look forward to the next chat</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
