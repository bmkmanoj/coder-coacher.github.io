get into commits and commit messages so
commits are one of the main reasons we
use get as a version control system so
you can make these incremental changes
and you can see what changed every time
you make a commit and a very important
part of this is the commit message so
why is the formatting of the commit
message so important well I think it
well formatted commit messages you I'm
probably most important reason is get
blamed right because you know as you go
digging through people's code or your
own code trying to figure out what
what's wrong you know especially if
you're looking for a bug but sometimes
you just want to know why I line of code
is the way that it is um the first thing
you're gonna do is run get blank is an
awesome tool and it's going to show you
the committer but also the commit
message and if that message is just like
added stuff like it gives you no context
for why the code changed or why it's
there in the first place and that's
super important it's super important for
you as you maintain your code down the
line it's super important for people to
follow after you and maintain your code
and and so yeah it's funny I definitely
when I look at candidates when I want to
dig through their github I check out to
see you know sort of how thorough and
well they communicate an organic
messages it's really important</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
