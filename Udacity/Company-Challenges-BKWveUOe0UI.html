be in different fields manufacturing
agriculture transportation education
finance no two companies are the same
but there are a couple of things that
can be said about any company first
every company has customers with a
problem to be solved even animal
shelters and government agencies have
customers maybe you work on a team that
works only with internal customers other
company team's second companies solve
problems by providing some kind of
product or service a cosmetics company
makes hair products to solve the problem
of bed hair a beverage company makes an
energy drink to combat tiredness an
education company creates online courses
to close the skills gap a tech company
creates a game engine for mobile games
to eliminate boredom companies identify
problems come up with solutions
implement their ideas and then deliver
products to customers so you can think
of it as a cycle that starts and ends
with the customer the challenge is to
build a high-quality cost-effective and
reliable solution that you can put in
the hands of your customer as soon as
possible it's important to be in
alignment on your overall company goal
when development teams are rewarded for
launching new features quickly but
operations is rewarded for keeping
things stable you have the potential for
conflict across teams when you realize
that the real goal is to deliver good
service to your customers teams are more
likely to work together to find a
solution to do this you have to
understand your customers are you
working for external or internal
customers if you are a part of a large
organization who are the internal people
who use your work what is the main
problem that your company or division is
trying to solve</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
