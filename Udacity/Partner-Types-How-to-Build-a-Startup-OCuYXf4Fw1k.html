partners one of the most interesting
concepts are strategic alliances one of
the concepts in a startup that it's
important to remember is this idea of
the whole product it turns out there is
no possible way on day one that your
startup could provide a mainstream
customer with a complete solution you
just can't you don't have enough time or
money or resources to fill out every
possible thing someone in a fortune 1000
company is going to put it on a
checklist or an RFP for you to provide
so the idea is to use strategic
alliances to complement your core
product with other products or services
could be training could be installation
could be service that is to surround
your product with a cloud of other
resources to address mainstream
customers for example in 1996 a
Starbucks partnered with Pepsi the
bottle distribute and to sell
Frappuccino which gave them access to
Pepsi's enormous distribution channel
now one word of caution you understand
them the phrase I used was to develop
the whole product to deliver a complete
solution to mainstream customers but the
mistake startups often make is thinking
that they're selling to mainstream
customers that they they first ship it
turns out that for most startups not in
an existing market you're not selling to
mainstream customers you're selling to
crazy people just like you and it turns
out that those people which we called
early evangelists are more than happy to
assemble the complete solution
themselves so all the biz dev activities
that startups scramble to get ready by
first customership
actually could be deferred in most
ventures to actually after you've got
those first early Vangelis customers
because it's the early evangelists who
will once they build the product
themselves will actually tell you what
the complete feature set is so think
about strategic alliances don't just
checklist I need a head of biz dev and
all these solutions on day one
think about what order they come in</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
