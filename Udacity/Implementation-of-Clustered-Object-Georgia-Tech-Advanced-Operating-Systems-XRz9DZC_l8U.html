of clustered objects given an object
reference there is a data structure in
the operating system called the
translation table and the translation
table maps an object reference to a
representation in memory so when you
have an object reference presented to
the operating system that can be pointed
to the particular representation
remember that the reference itself is
common the same object reference may be
pointing to this replica on a particular
processor a different replica on a
different processor and so on that's a
function of the translation table so on
each CPU this is what happens when an
object reference is presented the
operating system converts it to a
representation and this is a normal
operation now you present an object
reference but the object reference may
not be in the translation table yet
because this object has not been
referenced so far in that case you'll
have a Miss in looking up the
translation table and if a Miss happens
then there is another data structure in
the operating system called the
mishandling table and the miss handling
table is a mapping between the object
reference that you're presenting and the
handler that the operating system has
for dealing with this missing object
reference because of an object reference
is missing then the operating system has
to find some way to make this reference
point to a representation so that's the
focus of this object miss handler what
this object miss handler does is it
knows the particular representation for
this reference and it is also going to
make a decision should this object
reference point to a representation that
is already existing or should it create
a new representation for it all of those
decisions are going to be taken by this
object miss handler once it takes a
decision it creates a representation for
this object reference and it installs
the mapping between this object
reference and this representation in the
translation table so that subsequently
when you present the object reference it
will go to the particular representation
for that particular object reference so
that's the work done by the object miss
handler
and so this happens on every translation
this and the object reference is locally
resolved in this case because the object
miss handler is locally available and it
can handle that but it can happen that
the object miss handler is not available
locally now how will that happen well
the idea is that the miss handling table
itself is not a replicated data
structure it's a partitioned data
structure remember that all of these are
things that are being done under the
cover to implement the idea of a
clustered object so if you think about
the region object that we talked about
the region object is something that is
not going to be accessed on every
processor because depending on the
threads that are executing in a
particular region those are the threads
that need to access the region object
and therefore this miss handling table
is a partition data structure that
contains the mapping between object
references and the Miss handlers that
correspond to those object references so
in this particular example that I give
you the mishandling table happens to
contain the miss handler for this
particular object reference it is
possible that when an object reference
is presented in a particular processor
the object miss handler is not local
because the mishandling table is a
partition data structure what happens in
that case well that's why you have a
notion of a global miss handler and the
idea here is if the mishandling table
does not have the miss handler for that
particular object reference then you go
to a global miss handler this is
something that is replicated on every
node every node has this global miss
handler and this global miss handler
knows exactly the partitioning of the
mishandling table so it knows how this
miss handling table has in partition and
distributed on all the nodes of the
multiprocessor and so if an object
reference is presented on a node the
translation table will say well you know
this particular object reference
you don't know how to resolve it because
the object miss handler doesn't exist
here and therefore we're going to go to
this global miss handler and the global
miss handler because it was replicated
on every node it says oh I know exactly
which node has the mishandling table
that corresponds to this object
reference and so it can go to that node
and from that node it can obtain a
replica and once it obtains a replica it
can populate it in the translation table
for this particular node and once it
populates it then we're back in business
again as in this case so the function of
the global miss handler is to resolve
the location of the object miss handler
for a particular object reference height
so given an object reference I if you
have no way of resolving it locally then
the global miss handler that is present
on every node can tell you the location
of the object miss handler for this
particular object so that you can
resolve that reference get the replica
for it install it locally populate the
translation table then you're back in
business again so what this workflow is
telling you is how incrementally the
tornado system can optimize the
implementation of the objects so
depending on the usage pattern it can
make a determination that I used to have
a single replica it is now accessed on
multiple nodes maybe I should really
replicate it on multiple nodes so that's
a decision that can be taken during the
running of the system on the usage
pattern of the different objects</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
