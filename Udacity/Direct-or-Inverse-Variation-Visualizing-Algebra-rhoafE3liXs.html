miles in a rental car the cost will
usually go up now i know most rental car
companies have a flat fee but some also
charge per mile and they might charge if
you go over a certain number of miles so
in general if the miles go up the cost
also goes up so that must be direct the
second example would be inverse let's
say two people live together and rent is
four hundred dollars this would mean
each person pays two hundred dollars but
if we increase the number of roommates
let's say from two to four then people
wouldn't pay two hundred dollars each
they'd pay less now instead of paying
two hundred dollars each person will
just pay one hundred dollars so as one
quantity increases the other decreases
in verse the second case is another
example of inverse as the speed of a
vehicle increases the time that we have
to drive that vehicle decreases and
maybe you've never driven a car before
it but you could still think about this
if you are walking if we walk slower or
drive slower then that means our time
would increase to get to our final
destination one quantity is increasing
while the other is decreasing so that's
definitely an inverse relationship this
fourth example is an example of direct
if we don't drive for a while then we
can't cover as much distance so as one
decreases the other would decrease
likewise if we drive for a long time
than we can cover more ground so this
would be direct for this last example if
we make more money than we can spend
more money so that would be an example
of direct if our errors point in the
same direction then we know it's a
direct relationship whereas if our air
is pointed in opposite directions we
know it's an inverse variation</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
