course developer at Udacity and we're
here at all comp 2016 to talk with some
of the speakers and hear a little bit
about them and just WWDC and all other
kinds of things we'd like to chat about
I'm joined by Greg graves of rays labs
and thanks for being with us thanks for
having me glad to be here so we're just
getting introduced to each other for
everybody that's watching could you give
us a little introduction about yourself
yeah so you know my background is in
computer science studied software kind
of at a college and worked in kind of
product management and building products
at Microsoft and then really started my
own company about 13 years ago building
software and it was really with the
vision of how do you build a better
world with better software and how do
you build better technology and so I
started my company out of a coffee shop
and just slinging code and then
company's grown we're a little over 70
folks now and just having a lot of fun
building apps so what raise labs what
kind of apps do you guys work on so we
work on kind of a really wide variety of
things a lot of both fortune 500
companies where we're building web
infrastructure Android apps iphone apps
and we also work with a number of
startups who are really trying to figure
out what is the product market
opportunity for them and helping them
strategize around things as well we also
work with nonprofits as well so we had a
great talk about one of the projects
we're doing with the Perkins school for
the blind and so really wide range of
things we like to take on challenging
problems that sounds really interesting
can you talk more about the said is this
a bus stop for the ball yeah is the
Perkins bus stop app for the blind we we
worked on application to really try to
solve micro navigation and so folks that
are visually impaired can get roughly to
the right spot for a bus stop but they
can't get exactly to the bus stop and so
buses end up driving right past them so
we've been working with them for quite
some time trying to figure out in
prototype and explore these really
interesting and challenging problems so
it's a lot of fun how exactly did you
get started I guess approaching these
accessibility concerns for that app that
you work with on people and try to we
did we did yeah so that was a it's been
a great collaboration they obviously
been very helpful in available to us to
solve those but it's really going out
into the field and doing usability and
trying things out and getting better and
better with products and it's certainly
very poignant with the Perkins project
but it's something that we try to do on
all of our work which is validate the
things that we're trying to do actually
work with real users and it's so simple
a lot of developers forget I was
chatting with someone here today at all
comp and they had built a game and it
was cool and they showed it to me and I
was like you should show your friends
but don't tell them how to use it just
give it to them and it's that simple act
of observe a shin helps you see their
frustration than the pain point make it
better absolutely so I imagine that
maybe one of the exciting announcements
was the Siri SDKs for you guys like it
seems like a way to really address
accessibility well it's you know with
apple announcements it's always like
there's some things that are exciting
and there's some things we're like a
little bit of wait and see and so I
think the fact that Apple is opening up
Siri is super exciting and I think it
will create a bunch of opportunities for
voice integration interaction I think as
their developers are digging through the
SDKs and the API is defining there's
some limitations but again it's early
for Apple to announce stuff and so what
we've seen with dub dub like they
announce stuff and it evolves in shapes
and so we're psyched that someone that
the doors been opened a little bit and
we want to get our foot in there and get
the door open even wider besides sirree
is there another announcement from
yesterday is something that excited you
personally I mean there's a lot of
developer things that I think are
interesting there's speech recognition
and so some API speech recognition and I
think there's some things that are being
opened up on Apple watch which are
interesting and going to create deeper
engagements on the watch it's a number
of extensions and plugs into the mapping
infrastructure that are pretty
interesting and also a number of plugs
into the messaging protocol and how I
messages works it in whenever apple
announces a bunch of stuff you know it's
always fun to kind of like well what are
the new apps that are now possible that
weren't possible a year ago and so
there's always really neat opportunities
and kind of when I think about the apps
that have been released over the last
year
you kinda have to oh yeah like these
emoji keyboards that are now popping up
all over the place where because last
WWDC they announced keyboard extensions
and all those things so it sometimes
takes a little while but it can be
really transformative so you mentioned
the watch raised labs do you guys work
on all different of different apple
platforms or you stick with just one
yeah we were pretty we try to be fairly
platform agnostic and that goes not just
for mobile devices but for the web as
well and so we really believe in
building great technology and so we're
not like just for iOS devices we think
about Apple we think about Android we
think about html5 we think about
responsive web we think about the api's
as well and really how can we have the
biggest impact through technology how do
you approach that from like a
development standpoint you you shared
frameworks I think that's a process a
lot of our students kind of eventually
get to like how do I share my code
between the watch app and the iOS app or
yeah I mean across iOS devices it's much
easier to share code and frameworks and
things like that so Apple watch iPad app
you know iPhone app will share a lot of
Technology I think there's still some
challenges on sharing technology from an
Android project to an iPhone project and
so is the number of explorations that
we've been taking a bunch of other
companies have been taken to try to
figure out like can we cross compile
Swift can we do other things to make
that process easier it also seems like
they'll be concerned data wise how you
could share between the two platforms
you know google just announced firebase
is kind of an option for persisting
things yeah that'll be accessible to you
know iOS and other types of apps you
guys go with cloud kick or data what do
you guys use for I mean it's really
dependent more heavily on the client in
the project than anything else most a
lot of our products are enterprise-grade
and so therefore these large companies
and so the data warehousing has to often
be in their cloud or their
infrastructure and so it's really coding
to their api's and things like that I
think both firebase and other back into
the service platforms are really
empowering for certain types of products
but not everything's the same so we have
to kind of like dissect it and you know
if you're trying to share data across to
iOS devices then core data is fantastic
and
you know it's very easy but if it's a
requirement to share between iOS and
Android or other things like that you
have to kind of think about api's or
servers or how we're going to do that
now trace lab do you manage code bases
that are in both objective-c and Swift
what does that look like yeah we we did
a transition probably around the new
year where Swift had gotten to a level
of maturity we're really felt like we
could build full production enterprise
apps on top of it and so around the new
year we really transitioned said any new
project is going to be a swift project
we still have objective-c code bases
that will maintain an update as they
need to but for new modules are new such
new larger sections of those products
that are being built they're being re
are collecting rewritten in Swift would
that also be are extended to new
learners would you recommend Swift is
for you know the first language as
opposed to objective-c or something yeah
it's it's funny like I'm a big fan of
Korra and one of the most popular
questions i have on Korra is what should
new beginners learn is it objective c r
swift and I wrote the answer I want to
say like two three years ago and back
then the answer was absolutely learn
Objective C because objective c three
years ago would put you ahead of anyone
who just learned Swift to some extent
that might still be true because there's
a lot of low level knowledge of the
objective-c that's very helpful but
we've gotten to a level of maturity of
Swift that you can really be swift first
and really be a fairly equal footing
with everyone else so it's it's I don't
view it as a disadvantage at all anymore
and so yeah if you're a new learner like
jump in feet-first with Swift i think i
was super excited to see the playgrounds
thing that Apple announced and I think
that's just another kind of indication
that Apple's betting heavily on Swift
and they want it to be the predominant
learner platform and honestly I've never
seen any type of learner platform like
what they demonstrated i think it was
really revolutionary yeah so Swift
obviously open source now and their
stuff coming out for Linux other talk
about Swift web frameworks and stuff
have you been following any of that
discussion we have we and I mentioned
this we've been exploring whether we can
cross compile Swift onto Android to
write some of the business law
Jack or share some of that business
logic a couple of my guys have been
playing on with Swift on the server and
trying to see what we can do there I I
definitely think as a developer there's
a natural itch of like like I don't want
nine different languages and in terms of
companies trying to you know have that
unified language it's been tried in a
couple places you know Java certainly
tried it javascript has tried it and I
think Swift is a natural one to try it
as well so there are so many facets of
mobile development is there one in
particular that you really like to focus
on that you enjoy working on yeah
absolutely actually just today give a
talk on that and for me the thing that
I'm really passionate about is how
designers and developers can work better
together you know in my work I've seen a
lot of different projects where
designers like spend a ton of time
making something beautiful and then it's
hard to carry that beauty into the
actual implementation and likewise I've
seen people obsess over algorithms and
how a particular product is built but
then they don't spend enough time in the
user interface so all the depth and
complexity that they have in that power
isn't actually expressed or visualized
or used so it's really you know I'm
passionate about how do you connect
those dots how do you get designers and
developers working collaborating and
speaking each other's language because I
fundamentally think that's
transformative and builds better
products we have a student question
that's just about that and you know
assuming that the design and development
culture is something we're all you know
you wanting the unifying kind of bring
together why does it always happen yeah
I mean it's it's tricky and you know one
of the reasons it doesn't happen in the
there are several reasons is that
designers and developers speak a
slightly different language and so when
you talk about things like consistency
or balance affordances things like that
those might be designed phrases that
mean a particular thing if you talk
about consistency or object models or
frameworks or api's that's a very
developer centric language and so
designers and developers have to
understand each other and what they mean
what their intents are and so you know I
often recommend to developers when
they're looking at a particular design
not to just look at the pixels that are
represented on the composition but to
ask the questions of what is their
intent like what do they really
going to do and why this verse something
else because designers try to make
things usable and beautiful impractical
but sometimes they don't represent
what's not on the screen like what
happens when the list is blank what
happens when an error condition happens
what happens when you hit a timeout on a
server or what happens if you're not on
Wi-Fi what happens if you know you have
two items that are named the same thing
are they alphabetize that are the
systematize how are they sorted and
those are the little cell details of
when things don't go right the hard part
of user interface design is designing
for things that go wrong and how does it
go wrong and how does it recover and so
having those conversations and
facilitate that communication between
designers and developers I think it does
lead to better products at Ray's lab is
there a particular way that you get your
designers and developers integrated into
that process quickly do you guys start
from you know like the ideation phase of
a nap yeah with both teams they're ready
to work or you kind of bring in just
yeah we definitely at the beginning of a
project we do ideation or brainstorming
together and so it's and I have been at
companies and cultures where the
designers design completely in a vacuum
outside of development and I think it's
incredibly problematic because you're
designing something without really
understanding how it's going to be built
or seeing the opportunities of how the
technology can be used to do things that
designers weren't even aware of and so
we all get into Rome designers and
developers as equals and everyone picks
up a marker it doesn't matter if you can
draw or not we make product managers do
this as well we bring our clients into
the room we make them do it as well
because it's not everyone can draw boxes
and arrows and buttons and things like
that but by articulating what these apps
could look like or what's important to
them and why those things are important
it helps create that brainstorming
culture creates that we're on a level
playing field and we're on the same team
it's not designers verse developers it's
a well I'm going to design the best
thing you're going to build the best
thing but only together it's not it's
not independent at some point do you
take all the creative ideas energy from
those meetings and you know will it down
to the core focus on app what does that
look
yeah I mean our typical process is agile
based and so we work in two weeks prints
and so we'll start with that initial
ideation phase where we're doing a lot
of blue sky a lot of broad strokes it
could be something like this and then
day-by-day week-by-week we whittle it
down to things that were like okay we
can build that that's doable and so it's
great to start with blue sky like big
dream what can it be and then take a
step back and be like okay what's going
to impact the users the most and what
can we do in the time frame that we have
and how do we make it awesome within
that time frame absolutely is there a
particular piece of advice for somebody
that's just wanting to get into
development that you would really want
them to stick with going through that
could be helpful to them i would say
have fun with it like I think the reason
that I love development is because it
never felt like work it felt like
playing with LEGOs it was like they're
these little bricks and I can attach
them and get them to light up over here
move this thing over here and the
elements of play and fun being injected
into the products that we build make for
better products it makes our products
human it doesn't make them mechanical
and so we do that just in general we try
to inject a little bit and we call it
hacking you know hacking has you know
negative positive connotations but for
me its coding creativity like you can't
tell a developer be coding creative but
you can tell them to hack and that's
kind of what it is it's the it's a
lifelong habit for developers to have
passion in their craft of coding and it
requires them to have fun with it an
experiment and try things and be willing
to fail and be willing to throw
something out and try it over again and
it makes it fun it makes it engaging
what would your advice be to somebody
and this happens I imagine the most
anyone when they get started there are a
ton of roadblocks you're going to hit
problems you can't solve and still being
able to find the fun find the creativity
when times are tough yeah I mean I think
there's a little bit of perseverance and
trying things and being frustrated is
okay like that's part of learning and I
think recognizing that it's part of
learning allows you to get past it and
so
for people who are new or trying
something that they've never tried
before finding small challenges things
that are not these giant boil the ocean
i'm going to write this multiplayer game
with servers and components it's like
when we had an intern join raise labs
and this was the very early days of iOS
you know I gave the internet challenge
he he now heads up my San
francisco-oakland office but the
challenge was write a one-page iOS app
it can only have one screen it has to do
something useful and people have to be
willing to pay 99 cents for it and so
like he thought a lot about the problem
and how to do it and simplified and
simplified and at the end of the day was
a simple calculator but it allowed him
to overcome some of the unknowns like oh
I don't know how to create a UI view or
a label or a thing and or how to bring
up a keyboard or a number pad and you
build on these little building blocks
little by little by little and then you
get something amazing so start with
something small don't get frustrated you
know enjoy the small successes and build
on top of those sounds like it could be
a great Udacity project actually it
could absolutely be a great deal acid
budget has there ever been a problem or
if you could think of one what is the
hardest I problem you've had to solve as
a developer yeah the heart the hardest
problem in software is people and you
know the reason and passion about design
and development is because a lot of the
very hard problems in computer science
are now about the human element the
reason you're seeing things like Siri
and voice is because the voice and the
human expression is so much easier to
express that you know I want to go to a
restaurant at seven o'clock and what are
the places nearby that have Chinese you
know doing that in UI is very hard
expressing it in voices incredibly easy
and I'm super excited about how we can
solve those challenges through the human
element through user interface and user
interaction so Greg if you could give
just another piece of advice to
developers what would you what would you
tell them yeah I mean I I think it's
really important for folks to really get
immersed in their craft and really
practice it and have fun with it and do
a lot of it
the notion of becoming a great developer
is as much about habit and practice in
figuring this stuff out and you know I'm
a big believer in Malcolm Gladwell's
10,000 hours and so it really just takes
passion determination and in a lot of
hard work but in the end it's a lot of
fun thanks so much for being with us</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
