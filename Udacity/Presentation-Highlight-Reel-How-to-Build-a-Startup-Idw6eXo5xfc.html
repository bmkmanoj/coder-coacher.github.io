lucky never you make your own luck it's
a big idea you know at a single point in
time you'll say yeah I just happened to
be there when X happened or gee that
just kind of happened and I was just
there when somebody said X or Y over a
career you will now look back and go you
are not lucky you showed up more than
other people it took advantage you're
more other people you raised your hand
more often you were there more often you
got on a plane where everybody else went
adds too much of a hassle world-class
entrepreneurs do that over time
consistently and you can tell the
difference of whether you're going to
make it or not is when everybody else
says that too much worker well you mean
I got it like drive over there or you
mean you have to talk to the oh god it's
just too much about or yeah that's just
too hard I want you to remember that
that adds up over time in a career and
you will start making your own luck and
you will find that stuff will start
coming your way does this make sense
right yes this conference happened to
happen but you guys decided to go to it
somebody who I gave you a little hint
that perhaps you needed to do that but
but what my point is don't wanna
right don't ever think luck happens to
other people and I want you guys to
understand the distinction between
standing there waiting for direction
versus making your own direction by
making it happen so just as an aside
keep going guys it's good well we
thought these guys would know this big
problem say to existence it's a big it's
a big shift right where you know you
think they're just going to grab it out
of your hands and now you realize gee
there's a portion of evangelism here and
just remember if you're right a new
market turns into an existing market
fairly rapidly right but but at least on
day one when you're ahead of the game
the things you need to do about
evangelism about you know scale about
whether you're selling or evangelizing
is you're really kind of thing for
pitching to other comics or
because the other that you get
the people you're talking to as your
customers to be talking about this
problem itself as part of your journey
now yes explain you getting that message
out there and making your company
solution part of the conversation at all
the conference's in six months in the
year from now um is a critical thing to
do if you're going to do it you're of
course all this thing about yeah but so
the point is is that a lot of the reason
I'm pushing on these points that we're
talking about these things is a lot of
the pivots are off understanding the
complexity at shark or the pivots are
off there's some complexity the markets
not penetrable understand ecosystem
there's no insertion point for a new
technology or new company those are
probably more of the reasons for the
pivots than around the core technology
so the sooner you understand that
ecosystem the sooner you'll have a sense
of where you want to stay with it and
just know what was he vacuumed you guys
you know you may look at the fuel cell
market structure and go it's just not
penetrable from winter even though the
technology is applicable right so what
do you do for tomorrow tomorrow we're
going to go try and visit planning
Mordor for Redwood City and see whether
what they're thinking about because they
they're working on this so Fossum
proposed desalination plants on top of
that about how they're thinking about
that project and some of you are
probably wishing that now but hi I have
to tell you how proud I am of each and
every one of you here because you're
going to look back and what you did here
most of you and go holy can we actually
do that in that class well we were
taking a course load and work and
everything else and so for me it's just
a really impressive effort on all your
parts any other comments yeah I'm
guessing for some of you this was the
hardest class you might have taken and
that's the intent because as hard as
this class might have been it's so much
easier than when you get out and do it
for real
so the laboratory was a sort of a safe
place to stretch your muscles and see if
this fits and for a lot of you I think
it does and I'm thrilled to been a part
of I think guys are in a great job yeah
thank you guys congratulations and best
of luck to all you on Monday next money
started here itself real yeah so final
comment I would just share is it by
design this play
S is not taught right its experienced we
set up a framework under Steve's
leadership that gets you out of the
classroom and then we all sort of
monitor each other</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
