regions of DNA and activate
transcription are called activators and
transcription factors that bind silenced
or regions of DNA and repress
transcription are called repressors now
in reality most genes are actually a mix
of both activators and repressors giving
us a very fine-tuned gene expression
pattern of course this is called
combinatorial regulation because there's
a combination of both activators and
repressors in a certain trait can appear
or disappear depending on the threshold
of transcription that we reach for
example let's look at our trait of
lactose intolerance if my hands here
represent the scales of a balance of
lactose intolerance we're going to look
at how transcription can affect this
particular trait over here we'll have
lactose intolerance and over here we'll
have lactose tolerance as a baby many of
us can digest lactose in breast milk in
fact we can do this because we have
enough lactase being expressed from the
lactase gene having a lot of lactase
will allow us to digest that lactose and
we won't show signs of lactose
intolerance in fact we'll be lactose
tolerant but as we get older gene
transcription begins to slow or
diminution some people particularly
those like Shalu and instead we reach a
threshold we reach a critical tipping
point where we have so little lactase
that we don't have enough to digest the
lactose in our diet and instead the
lactose stays around and gets digested
by all that bacteria and we have
symptoms of lactose intolerance</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
