little bit subjective depending on what
you want to model but I think that there
are three components that are absolutely
essential to keep the first one is you
need a memory for the computer because
otherwise it will not really be able to
perform any computations the second one
is you need some sort of input and some
sort of output it doesn't really have to
be a graphical output or be displayed on
a monitor but you need to be able to
tell the computer what the input is that
it's supposed to work on and you need to
have some way of reading the output once
the computer is done and you will also
need some sort of flexibility in the
processing that the computer is doing so
we expect it to have certain programming
capabilities all the other components I
think are not essential so you do not
necessarily need a graphics card as long
as you have a certain type of output you
certainly don't need a mouse to input
anything you don't need a monitor you
don't need to file system or operating
system because if you really want that
you can emulate that using the
programming capabilities and you
certainly also do not need a cd-rom as
long as you have some way of providing
the input</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
