already created this one is identical to
all the others that you've been using
throughout this course it has a single
view and there's a map fragment on that
view the Gradle file is set up for the
Play services libraries and the manifest
file is set up in the usual way with
OpenGL with the services libraries with
the API key and with the permissions
that I want to use Internet access
network state and right external storage
and of course on my Google developers
console as I showed you earlier on I've
configured this API for access through
that API key and the API key is here now
let's take a look at the main activity
so in my main activity class I've just
created a number of local variables of
marker options type and I just named
them after the various rinks rent in
Kirkland Everett Lynwood Mont they can't
show where I've also created a camera
position that I called Seattle which is
just the default camera position that
I'm using when the application actually
launches then in my uncreative marker
options in the way that I had
demonstrated on the slide so for example
Renton is new marker options with the
latitude and longitude of Renton and the
title Renton I was able to get the
latitudes and longitudes for each of the
rinks using the technique that I showed
earlier on just using Google Maps
dropping a pin and reading the latitude
and longitude from them so I've set up
all of my marker options for all of my
rinks and then in my own map ready
function so remember the on map ready
callback gets called when the map is
ready because I've implemented on map
ready call back in my activity so when
the on map ready gets called I simply
add all the markers to my map so M
mapped on add marker Renton and mapped
out marker
Kirkland etc I add them all and then I
called fly to Seattle and the flight Who
function is very similar to the one that
you saw in the previous demo except this
time I'm just moving the camera I'm not
animating it so that I'm just going to
fly to Seattle and I'm just going to
jump into that location I haven't put
any fly to to the particular rinks all
the only time flight 2 has been called
in this application is right at the
beginning when I say fly to Seattle and
the only time that the flight 2
functions called is of course in the on
map ready when they fly to Seattle so
that will just give me a default view
looking at Seattle in
location where we could see all of the
rinks on the same map so I had moved the
camera to the appropriate location to
allow me to do that
and that was the camera that was defined
at Seattle as you can see here with the
latitude longitude a zoom of 10 bearing
of 0 so I'm looking straight down and a
tilt of 45 degrees that was pretty
simple right and in the next step you're
actually gonna build a custom marker so
you're not going to use the default
marker pen you could create your own
marker for example a hockey player but
before we get to that let's have a
little quiz about using markers on maps</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
