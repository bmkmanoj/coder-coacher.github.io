sentence Ashok ate a frog when I say the
sentence you understand its meaning
immediately but what did you understand
what is the meaning of the meaning of
the sentence how can I capture that
meaning how can we capture it in a
machine let us focus for now on the verb
in this sentence which is eight will
associate a frame with the verb in this
sentence later on we will see their
frames can also be associated with the
objects or the nouns in this sentence
but for now we will focus on the verb
now what is it that we know about these
stereotypical action of eating what
happens when people eat when you and I
eat usually there is an agent that does
the eating and that particular agent may
correspond to the subject of the
sentence usually something is being
eaten that's the object there is often a
location where the eating is done or the
time when the eating is being done
someone might use a utensil to do the
eating you might eat with a fork or a
spoon for example there might be other
things that we know about the
stereotypical action of eating for
example what is being eaten typically is
not alive at least not when humans eat
it now this particular slot object is
this concern see location of the object
where is your object after it has been
eaten and we might say well it's inside
the subjects body what might be the mood
of this subject
well after people have eaten typically
they are happier so here is a list of
slots that we associate with the
stereotypical
action of eating this is not an
exhaustive list you can add some more so
each of these slots may take some values
we call these values fillers so slots
and fillers some of the fillers here a
by default some of the fillers may come
from parsing this sentence so we know
that in this particular sentence your
subject is Ashok and the object is a
frog okay so a frame then is a knowledge
structure note the word structure there
are a number of things happening in this
knowledge representation if I may take
an analogy with something
which I'm sure you're familiar
constantly difference between an atom of
knowledge representation and a molecule
of knowledge representation some
knowledge representations are like atoms
other knowledge representations are like
molecules an atom is a unit by itself a
production rule is like an atom on the
other hand frames are like molecules
they have a structure there are large
number of things happening these
molecules could expand or contract you
can do a lot more with frames that you
can do with a simple production rule so
frame isn't like a knowledge structure
which has slots and which has fillers
that go with it some of these fillers
are by default frame deals with a
stereotypical situation consider now a
different sentence suppose we had the
sentence David ate a pizza at home now
here I have filled out what a frame for
this particular sentence would look like
the subject is different the object is
different this time there is some
information of a location in the
previous sentence there was no
information about location let us
compare these two frames for another
second note that he slots in case of
both the frames are exactly the same
because the frame corresponds to the
action of eating the fillers on the
other hand are different at least some
of the fillers are different because
this fillers correspond to the various
input sentences
the only fillers are the same are those
fillers which have to do with default
values for particular slots</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
