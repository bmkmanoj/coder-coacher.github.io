snooping coherence first let's look at
two caches only each of which has two
blocks with a single valid bit per block
and the tag and then the data and both
of these caches are connected to the
same bus to which we also connect the
memory so now let's say that the cache
is that initially empty so the valid
bits are all 0 and this processor reads
something in block a we have a cache
miss here we send the request to memory
this cash is always monitoring what's
going on on the bus but it's only
interested in writes so this read is
really going to be seen and ignored by
this cache the data for a comes back
from memory and now we put this block in
the cache the block becomes valid and
the tag let's say just indicates that
this is the block a now let's say that
this processor writes to a so now we
have a situation with this processor
even if it does a write through access
directly to memory I read on this
processor would still read the stale
value of a let's say that the value we
read here was 0 now let's say that this
processor writes 1 to a this right even
if we made it good all the way to memory
would not result in coherent behavior
for this cache because a subsequent read
here was still hid in the cache and get
a 0 so this is when write update and
snooping come into the picture we have a
cache miss but because it's a right we
send a request for the block along with
an indication that it's a right and what
is the value and what's the address so
now what happens is this request goes to
memory and the memory writes 1 to a but
more importantly this cache is
monitoring the bus and sees that block a
is being updated it checks its internal
state and sees that it has block a and
then it takes the value that is being
written so this part is the snooping
part where we see what's going on on the
bus so we cannot miss any of the writes
happening on another core because we are
monitoring the bus and all writes have
to go through the bus
that's the snooping part the
write-update part is that when we see a
write we update our copy of the data
with the value that is being written so
this cache now gets a 1 here if we read
a after this we are going to get this
one so this ensures correct behavior if
there are multiple cores they can not
disagree about which write happened
first which one happened last because
all of the writes are sent through the
bus and because it's a single broadcast
bus it happens one at a time so all of
them see writes in exactly the same
order in the order in which writes
go to the bus now let's see what happens
if both of this processor try to write
away at about the same time so this is a
situation where they might disagree
about who's right happened first let's
say that this one is trying to write 2
and this one is trying to write 3 well
there is a single bus so there is a
single set of wires that can carry the
value and the address and so on
so processors when they want to send
something on the bus first have to
arbitrate for it and this arbitration
for the bus basically decides who gets
the bus next if they score one then each
sends its write first now both of the
caches will have to this one because
this is where the write happened this
one because this is what we pick up from
snooping and only then after this is
complete this right here gets to occur
so now we go to three broadcast that
here and it gets here so as you can see
both of them agree which write was first
in which was second obviously the one
that wrote three was the second one
because that's the last value we kept so
the write update is ensuring that writes
are seen by regional course and the
snooping of the common bus and the
serialization on that bus basically
going one at a time to the bus is
guaranteeing that everybody sees the
same order of writes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
