assertions that help you ruling out
large parts of the state you may still
end up with a multitude of individual
origins where your specific infection
may come from and while you can rule
them out one after the other using the
scientific method the question is which
of these origins are going to look at
first the idea is to look at the most
likely origins first and the question is
what is a likely origin what possible
origin should I look at first he is a
few guidelines first and foremost
infections if you know that some origin
is wrong go for it next is causes if you
know that some state causes the failure
because you can change it to another
value such that the failure goes away
which is something you can find out
through delta debugging for instance
follow it next up code smell if you
suspect some code to be wrong or you
have gotten warnings from a static
checker go for it next up is bug history
if you know that some piece of code has
gotten a lot of problem reports lately
chances are what you're looking at will
be another problem report next step is
last changes code that has changed
recently is way more likely to have
errors so go for code which has recently
changed and go for the state that comes
out of this code finally anomalies if
some code shows abnormal behavior before
reaching the failure for instance by
producing a log entry follow this one as
well of all these features infections
are the strongest because they are sure
indicators of errors followed by causes
any cause implies a way to possibly work
around the failure as far as the others
are concerned though this is very up to
you and the specific project in fact
this is where your knowledge about the
specific project and its domain and the
code comes into play
being able to specifically focus on the
most likely sources of a bug makes you a
debugging expert for the specific
project</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
