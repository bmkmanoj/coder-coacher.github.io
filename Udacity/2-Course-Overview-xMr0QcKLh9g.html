past and then hold it let's pause for a
second and talk about what persistence
and persisting data actually means
persistence is saving data to a place
where it can be re accessed and
retrieved upon restart of the device or
app this can mean non-volatile memory on
your device or saving data to remote
servers persistence is necessary for any
app that wants to store data long term
that is longer than the life cycle of
the running app and keep it available to
the user in this course we Fernando me
and you will go over how persistence
works why it's needed what options are
available for creating persistent iOS
apps and what the most important ones
are we'll also add simple persistence to
a recording app and work in a completely
new app to level up our persistence
skills you'll see a lot of Eden at the
start and more of me Fernando later on
as course developers here at Udacity
we're here to guide you through the
learning process of iOS app persistence
will start with NS user defaults one of
the available options for persistence
then in lesson two we'll discuss the iOS
file system and sandboxing in lesson
three we'll move on to our second and
most important option for persistence
core data or we'll talk about the pieces
of the core data stack how to create a
data model and how to make objects from
that data model lesson 4 will finish
implementing core data and see how it
actually persists our changes we'll see
what happens behind the scenes and most
importantly what core data provides
beyond persistence will also learn how
to display core data objects in tables
and collection views and in lesson 5
will dive deeper and find out how to
search and filter objects you know how
to migrate our data model which is vital
to know before uploading an app to the
app store so let's get started by
finding out how the dot plans to save
marty's algorithm by using
nsuserdefaults</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
