offset index and tag in the address for
set associative caches this is a 2-way
set-associative cache that has four sets
when the processor produces an address
the least significant bits the tell us
where in the block we are are still
determined by the block size the index
bits are the ones the tell us which set
are we talking about so the number of
index bits is determined by how many
sets we have in this case we have four
sets so we need two index bits the
remaining bits are the tag like in a
direct mapped cache once we have placed
a line in for example set 0 we know that
everything that maps to set 0 will have
bits 0 0 here so we don't have to keep
that in the tag inside zero we only need
to make sure that what we now need
matches what we have in the uppermost
bits not in the index bits because the
fact that we are looking at set 0 means
that we have already determined that
these bits are 0 0 and everything that
we could have placed here also has 0 0
bits in the index interestingly a direct
mapped cache of the same size we have
one more index bit so it would have
slightly smaller tag</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
