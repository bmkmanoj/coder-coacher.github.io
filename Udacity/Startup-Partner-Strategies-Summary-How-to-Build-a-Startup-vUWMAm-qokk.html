great but understand you're not a peer
of these large companies and all the
books and literature that talks about
partnerships very rarely addresses
startup to large company partnerships
these are asymmetrical relationships and
so don't confuse partners that you need
early on to address early Vangelis with
the ones that you might need a year or
two for now to a jet dress mainstream
customers so remember if you've been
getting out of the building you actually
found the early passionate customer
segments or people inside those segments
that will buy your product even
unfinished or unbuilt or buggy as it is
understand what they need now and help
them teach you what the mainstream will
need later and so don't confuse big
company partnering with startup strategy
find the partners that gives you an
unfair advantage and just keep in mind
and and this really requires a bit of
città sysm that you really don't matter
to a large partner they matter
enormous ly to you but I would keep a
jaded eye out and understands what's in
it for you to build your company so that
one day you're bigger than that so one
of the other advantages about talking to
partners keep in mind is this is almost
like dating while you're out there
talking to them understanding what
resources what activities can they could
provide or what supply chain they could
fulfill for you also understand that
some of them might be your potential
acquirer someday and so even if the
relationships don't work out or the
deals don't work out always be on your
best behavior always in fact make them
wish boy this would be a great part of
our company because right now you might
not want to be acquired but some days
someone might want to come back when
you're bigger with an offer that you
just couldn't refuse and you get to buy
the house and the car and the and the
airplane at the South of France and
remember how great you were in those
partnership discussions so partnerships
can be strategic
they could be fun they could be
nerve-racking understand they're an
integral part of your business model and
business model canvas go out and talk to
a ton of them and when you do you'll
understand how to use them to make your
startup into a large company</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
