or negative 2x is greater than 10 how
would you go about finding the solution
set for X this is called a compound
inequality a compound inequality
consists of two inequalities connected
by either the word or or the word and if
the word or is used that means that any
value of the variable that makes either
inequality true is in the solution set
so getting back to this problem x + 1 is
greater than or equal to 9 simplifies to
X is greater than or equal to 8 and this
simplifies to X is less than five and
because this is an or compound
inequality any value of the variable
that makes X is greater than or equal to
8 or x is less than 5 true is in the
solution set X is greater than or equal
to 8 will look like this with a closed
circle at eight and the line extending
to infinity positive infinity on the
right and with an open circle over the
five and the arrow pointing towards
negative infinity so both X is less than
5 and X is greater than or equal to 8
are part of the solution set</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
