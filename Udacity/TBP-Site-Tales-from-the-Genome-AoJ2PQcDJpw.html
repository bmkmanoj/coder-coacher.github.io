consensus sequence that's usually about
30 to 40 base pairs away in front of the
transcription start site of most genes
so here we have the transcription start
site indicated by the arrow and the plus
one the coding region is over here to
the right and in front of it over here
we have the promoter region in the same
way that we would start counting + 1 + 2
+ 3 down our coding region and that
would start measuring counting right the
number of letters that are going to be
in our mRNA transcript we can start
counting backwards to get the numbered
positions for our promoter region so we
have minus one minus two minus three and
we can go on back to the minus 32-40
region so let's focus in on this region
about 30 or 40 letters or base pairs
upstream or in front of this
transcription initiation site here i'm
showing you six different samples not
different genes not different promoters
the same promoter from six different
people let's say so we have six
different people and this is their
sequence the the letters in their
promoter region at this minus 32-40
region in front of a specific gene in
their genome what I want you to tell me
now that you've learned about what a
consensus sequence is is look at these
six different sequences and tell me what
is the consensus sequence for these six
positions and the minus 32-40 region of
the promoter for this hypothetical gene</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
