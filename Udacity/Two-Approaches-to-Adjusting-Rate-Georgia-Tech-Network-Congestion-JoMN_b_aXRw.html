in this approach a sender can only have
a certain number of packets outstanding
or quote in flight and the sender uses
acknowledgments from the receiver to
clock the retransmission of new data so
let's suppose that the sender's window
was four packets at this point there are
four packets outstanding in the network
and the sender cannot send additional
packets until it has received an
acknowledgement from the receiver when
it receives an acknowledgment or an ACK
from the receiver the sender can then
send another packet so at this point
there are still four outstanding or four
unacknowledged packets in flight in this
case if a sender wants to increase the
rate at which its sending it simply
needs to increase the window size so for
example if the sender wants to send at a
faster rate it can increase the window
size from four to five a sender might
increase its rate any time it sees an
acknowledgement from the receiver in TCP
every time a sender receives an
acknowledgment it increases the window
size upon a successful receipt we want
the sender to increase its window by one
packet per roundtrip so for example in
this case if the sender's window was
initially four packets then at the end
of a single round trips worth of sending
we want the next set of transmissions to
allow five packets to be outstanding
this is called additive increase if a
packet is not acknowledged the window
size is reduced by half this is called
multiplicative decrease so TCPS
congestion control is called additive
increase multiplicative decrease or aimd
the other approach to adjusting rates is
an explicit rate based congestion
control algorithm in this case the
sender monitors the loss rate and uses a
timer to modulate the transmission rate
window based congestion control or
MD is the common way of performing
congestion control in today's computer
networks in the next lesson we will talk
about the two goals of TCP congestion
control further efficiency and fairness
and explore how TCP achieves those goals</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
