problem that you worked with Sarah in
that problem an object was shared with
two variables let's have a closer look
at what happens in that case here we
have an object that's stored in a
variable now it's important not to
confuse the object which I've drawn here
with the variable in Java an object
variable does not actually contain the
object instead it contains information
on how to find the object it contains
the location of the object we draw that
location with an arrow and we call it a
reference now suppose we make a second
variable and copy the first one into the
second in that case we simply copy this
reference into this variable as you can
see now both the variable box and the
rear of a box to refer to the same
object now suppose we call a mutator on
one of the variables as you can see the
object has changed and that change is
observable both through the variable box
and through the variable box - that's
just our object variables work in Java
and it's good to know
because you can then explain how objects
work when they are copied Sarah will
practice that with you with another
problem</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
