these is a cup and which one of these
meets the definition of the cup on the
previous screen so according to my
intuitive definition of a cup three of
these objects are cups the object in the
top right is not because that's a potato
masher the object in the top left isn't
because that's a little pale and the
object in the bottom middle is not
because that's actually a candlestick
holder according to the definition of a
cup that the robot was bootstrapped with
however only the potato masher doesn't
meet the definition all five of these
objects have flat bottoms they all have
concave ed they're all light and they're
all liftable we might not think that the
candlestick holder is liftable because
it doesn't have a handle but we might
also think that it's liftable because
it's light enough so either way would
work for that but it's clear that the
pale up here meets all our definitions
for a cup but it's clear that the pale
meets all our requirements for a cup but
is not actually a cup let us build on
David's answers let us suppose that the
robot goes to the kitchen and finds his
bail in the kitchen it looks at a pedal
and decides that this bill meets its
definition of a cup denoted here by the
solid circle the robot brings water to
you in this pale you look at the pale
and you say to the robot no robot this
is not a cup at this point you would
expect you robot to learn from its
failure cognitive agents do a lot of
learning from failures failures are
opportunities for learning we would
expect robots an intelligent agents more
generally to learn from their failures
as well how then may a robot learn from
the failure of considering this pale as
a cup note that the problem is not
limited to this particular pill we can
take a different example connecting with
this particular cup imagine that the
definition of cup included the statement
that it must have a handle in which case
the robot may not recognize that this is
a cup later on you may teach the robot
this in fact is a good example of a cup
because it's liftable in that case the
robot may want to understand from that
failure it may want to understand why
did it not consider to be a cup it
should have considered it to be a cup so
the problem is not just about successes
that turned out to be failures but also
about failures that should have been
successes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
