where we are so we did row plays so I
can check off that bird what's left well
now I want to be able to do all the
plays all the plays in all the rows and
all the columns another thing I want to
be able to do is you know notice that I
cheated a little bit I engaged in
wishful thinking which is always a good
design strategy in that when I called
Road plays I gave it a hand in a row but
I made the row myself built that sample
row but I called a row by making a list
and saying okay I know a is here I know
it an anchor called mnx is here and so
on I didn't have my program construct
that row all plays is going to have to
somehow do that type of construction
it's going to somehow have to set the
anchors within the row rather than
having me give them explicitly as a test
and then just one more thing to deal
with which is scoring so after I've got
all the plays I want to be able to
figure out how much each one scores and
pick out the top scoring play I talked
about pacing at the beginning of this
now I'm starting to pick up the pace so
I'm feeling pretty good now I'm saying
it was a long way we had to run hard but
now I can start to see the finish line
so we can put together one final sprint
to get it all done so what do I want to
do next I want to handle complete boards
not just individual rows so just as we
did with rows where we made up a sample
row well let's make a sample bored so I
defined a function a board which returns
a sample board it's the same one we were
dealing with here note that i'm making
this a function rather than a variable
definition and the reason I'm doing this
is because every time I reference a
board I want to create a new one and I
want to create a new one because I'm
going to be modifying the old one I'm
going to be placing letters onto the
board i'm going to be inserting anchors
into the board and modifying the board
structure itself I don't want to be
dealing with the old one that I've
already modified I want to make sure i
have a fresh one from scratch and so i'm
going to say the only way to access this
is through the function so what it does
is it takes these strings maps list over
each one so rather than have this first
row be a string the first row will be
then a list of characters same for all
the other rows and there we can see when
we call a board we get this board but
that's not very pretty to look at and
rather look at something like this we're
here i printed the results no
that I put spaces between each letter to
make the board more square like and so
what I'd like you to do is define a
function show which takes a board as
input prints out the results looking
just like that returns none as a value</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
