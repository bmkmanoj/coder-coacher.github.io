an example I think this might be taken
also from Linda Shapiro so the idea is
that you're imaging these cherries okay
and the idea is that the background here
is very dark okay and a healthy cherry
is kind of bright all right but a
bruised part is medium dark and what
you'd like to do is be able to say do I
have a bunch of bruised pixels so in
this particular one they've removed all
the black things but you see these are
the grayscale values right and you and I
look at this and we say yep you know
what here's my threshold and this is the
number of pixels that are bruised and
this is the number of pixels that are
good and the idea of finding a threshold
like that automatically is not trivial
generally what you do when you're
looking for thresholds is you take a
histogram of the intensities right so
this might be you know go from 0 to 255
and this is the number of pixels that
you have in the image and the question
is you know what are your distributions
unlike this one which had this nice
clean just separation there this one
it's a lot more complicated are there
too or are there three I think you know
for my for my take I'd say oh there's
three lobes there alright and there's
different ways of trying to do that a
simple method this is again a long kind
of apps whose method it's it's it's a
binary vision method that basically says
find assume that your system is bimodal
and find the cutoff that minimizes the
within-group variance okay so you're
only allowed to draw one line and so and
it's weighted by essentially this these
values and when you do that what's kind
of cool about it is you can do that when
it's certainly bimodal when it's
actually trimodal let's say you'll
typically pick one of the modes alright
and then you can look and do it again
and you'll cut it again and what's kind
of nice is when you slice a mode that
shouldn't be sliced you'll get a
reduction in the variance but not very
much and you can track how much that is
and the method can be adapted to do a
pretty good job of
fresh holding a continuous grayscale
into either a binary or
a three valued system</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
