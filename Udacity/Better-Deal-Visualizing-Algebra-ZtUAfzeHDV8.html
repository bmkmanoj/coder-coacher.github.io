why we saw earlier that carnival charges
ten dollars for registration fee and ten
dollars per hour for reading the car
riddick are charges thirty dollars for
registration fee and six dollars per
hour or X that we rent the car this
would be the total cost let's see a
table of values and these two equations
graphs here are two equations and the
lines for our graph and here's a table
of values X was the number of hours of
reading the car and this Y represents
the cost for a carnival car rental the
second Y represents the cost for a
rent-a-car car rental we can see at one
hour that ridic our costs more than
carnival we also see that on the graph
rent a car costs thirty six dollars and
carnival costs twenty dollars in this
region of the graph we can see that
Carnival is the better option it's
cheaper or the cost the Y value is below
that of rent a car but we can see at
other times like seven hours that rent a
car is the better option it's cheaper we
also see that on our graph rent a car
costs $72 and carnival costs eighty
dollars so it depends Carnival is
usually better for the shorter car
rentals and rent a car is better for the
longer car rentals</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
