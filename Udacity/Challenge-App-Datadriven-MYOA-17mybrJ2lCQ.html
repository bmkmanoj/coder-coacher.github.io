beginning of the lesson we created a
make your own adventure app using static
segues now we're going to expand on that
app using data-driven stories here's the
completed version of data-driven make
your own adventure here's the tiger
story from the beginning of the lesson
just like before we navigate through the
different nodes by clicking on different
prompts most of the story notes have two
prompts but of course the nodes that end
the story have none in a second we'll
look at the code for the data model that
drives these stories each node in the
story has a struct that describes the
nodes message and the prompts to move on
to other story nodes right now you're
looking at a completed version of the
app but in the branch for step 5.5 the
table view delegate and data source
methods for the story node view
controller have been left blank when we
run this incomplete version notice that
there are no prompts your task is to
modify the story node view controller so
that this table is working let's take a
closer look at the data structure the
app has four stories stored as
serialized versions of arrays and
dictionaries here in the supporting
files group you'll learn more about how
to store razon dictionaries in iOS
persistence course so for now let's
focus on how that stored data is parsed
into these model objects that represent
stories here you can see that there's a
class to represent each adventure it has
a credits property for the author's name
and a start node property which contains
the first line of the story initially
these adventures get shown by the route
table view controller here's the table
view it governs and when the user
selects a story the story node view
controller gets pushed onto the
navigation stack let's take a look at
that code so here we are in the route
table view controller and we want to
scroll down to the method did select row
at index path so here's what happens
when a user chooses a story first you
get the adventure object then you grab
the first node in that adventure you
instantiate the story node view
controller from the storyboard object
then you set the story node that's going
to start that adventure and get loaded
into the story node view controller and
you push the story node view controller
on to the
vacation stack the story node view
controller shows one story note at a
time let's take a look at the struct for
that story node here you can see the
message property that provides the text
for the story and then there are three
different methods related to the story
prompts the prompt count which tells you
how many rows that prompt table should
have the prompt text for a given index
and then the story node objects that a
given prompt leads to you can see that
now that we have an underlying data
model we don't need all those view
controllers like we had before we just
need this one story node view controller
and we populate it with different data
your challenge is to write the code that
will populate the table of prompts and
then perform a push segue to the next
story node when a prompt is selected if
you open up the story node view
controller and you scroll down to the
table view delegate and data source
methods you'll notice that they're
either empty or they just have
placeholder data your challenge is to
fill these methods in and get the app
working</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
