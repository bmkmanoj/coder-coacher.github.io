think about an operation for taking a
square root in English we might say
something like as far as a precondition
is concerned the argument had better be
a non negative number as far as a post
condition is concerned something like
the square of the computed results must
equal the argument that's a little bit
backwards way of thinking about things
but in fact it is a true expression of
equality okay that must must be the case
if square root has the meaning we expect
it to have if we were to express these
particular constraints in ocl we might
do them in the context of the built in
class real and having adding an
operation called square root that
returns as a result a real answer the
precondition is that the argument which
is in this case is the number we're
taking a square root of had better be
greater than or equal to zero and the
post condition is that that the argument
should be equal to the result when
multiplied by itself</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
