segment avoids first of all the small
right pitfall so for instance here we
might decide that for certain log
segments x y&amp;amp;z the stripe group is this
and for another set of log segments a P
Q and R the stripe group is this and for
another set of log segments LM and n the
stripe group is this so we r sub setting
the service into these stripe groups and
what that allows is parallel client
activities if the log segments x y and z
belong to a particular client end of the
log segments p qn are belong to a
different client and LM NN belong to a
different client then you can see that
the client activity corresponding to
this this particular stripe group can go
on and parallel with this and similarly
this activity can go on in parallel with
other stripe groups that exist in the
system and so on and so it increases the
availability of the server in saying
that not all the server's has to be
working on the same client requests
different subset of servers are working
on different client requests and that
results in higher throughput for overall
client processing and also when it comes
to cleaning the logs remember that I
mentioned earlier that every once in a
while you have to clean the logs because
the logs may have been overwritten by
new rights to files on a particular
client machine in which case there are
logs that have to be recycled and if you
don't recycle them you're filling up the
disks with junk and therefore every once
in a while we have to go and clean up
the log and so efficient log cleaning is
again facilitated by the fact that you
have different stripe group so you could
assign different cleaning service for
different stripe groups that increases
the parallelism in the management of all
the things that need to be done in a
distributed file system an increased
availability also means that you can
survive multiple server failures so
let's say that these two discs fail for
some reason you can still serve the
clients who are being served by this
particular stripe group that's the idea
of subsetting the server group for
striping so that you increase the
availability and allow incremental
satisfaction of the user community in
spite of failures that may be happening
in the system as a whole</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
