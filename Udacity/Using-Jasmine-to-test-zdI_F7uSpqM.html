overview of what jasmine is and how
we're going to be using it in our
project so I'm going to be screen
sharing right now okay um as you can see
I am in our github repo for a feed
reader so whenever you go into so you
had this master branch where you have a
bunch of different folders index dot
HTML readme you go into jasmine and then
you go into spec where you see in feed
you see feed readers this is the file
that you're going to be writing your
test soon in so as you can see this file
already has some stuff in it so it has a
bunch of documentation which is really
good you guys have to go through it um
since all the tests that you will be
writing are listed under traduced right
here um so let me just um sort of yeah
let me zoom into it okay so you have all
these two dues
so all these two dues are what the tests
that you need to be writing so all of
that if you can see there is one little
short of code that is written and it's
actually written using jasmine
documentation so what the describe is is
it actually is linked reading is it's
defining a suite and the name of the
suite is going to be RSS feeds so this
is going to be this part of your test
suite for RSS feeds for testing RSS
feeds and then you have these
documentation together that specifies
this is our first test and test to make
sure that all feeds variable have been
defined and that it's not empty and you
have to experiment with this before you
get started with your project so what
happens when you change all feeds and
approach a has to be an empty array and
refresh the page as you can see um this
is what Jonathan was talking about in
his last office hours where he actually
deleted the all feeds variable made it
empty and then he sort of tried running
this code and it failed so what I'm
gonna do is the next part line 24 is it
are defined function so what it is is
the if function inside is called
a speck so as what is a speck a speck is
a JavaScript function that says what
some piece of your program should be
doing so as you can see RSS feeds need
to be defined that is essentially what
you have to do in this code and it is
just a function that's going to define
your specs so a tests we can have a
zillion specs that define a zillion
tests the next line when you go is the
expect function so what does he expect
says so the expect function acts on the
all feeds variable and it says to be
defined so you need all the feeds inside
your JSON object to be defined and the
length should not be 0 so as you can see
this is very readable and if you want to
explore all these functionalities the to
be defined and to be 0 functionalities
what you can do is you can go back to
the Jasmine folder and then go into the
your Lib jasmine to point one point two
and when you open Jasmine Jas what you
can see is I'm going to be searching to
be defined so as you can see there are
four instances so the first one is
actually providing you a mattress so as
you can see these are called matchers so
whatever goes into your expect and all
these functions are called your matters
so you go down and you can see that this
is how the to be defined is is defined
and it's going to either return I think
a variable that is going to say no is it
true or is it false um so that's what
it's sort of going to give you and you
have a lot of other functions called to
be false e to be greater than to be less
than you can make use of any of these
inside your test suite depending upon
what heard of tests you want to act on
so yeah that was a very quick and short
summary but if you have more questions
on t-64 you're free to post on the
forums and i'm sure your peers or the
instructors will be glad
to help you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
