interpretation of the equations however
it's important to notice we compute H nu
as a modification of age but only use H
in the implementation of hoynes method
up here we might run into some
difficulties if the numerical error
becomes really really tiny because then
as you can see right here in the
computation of H nu or dividing by the
air and that would basically make us end
up dividing by zero so one option to
prevent this from happening would be to
divide not just by the air but by the
air plus some really small number
another precautionary measure that me
might want to take would be to limit the
range of possible values of the step
size so if we do that then here's what
happens if H is smaller than 0.1 then
the maximum becomes 0.1 and eventually
you'll end up with a value of 0.1 now if
time gets larger than 1,800 then the
minimum becomes 1800 and the new step
size becomes 1800 so this limits the
range of H nu to be between 0.1 and 1800
now let's look at the output so we can
see that the program takes huge steps
along its trajectory and keep in mind
that these steps are not at regular time
intervals because they represent the
steps that we're taking with adaptive
step size so timer interval down here is
much smaller than the time interval up
here one last thing that we can notice
here is that the very first step size is
small because we initially set each to
100 seconds and then the method
automatically chooses a larger one as we
can see right here and then it keeps
that larger one although of course it
does change</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
