one that goes from notebook to note and
another one which goes from note to note
book in order for core data to work it's
magic it's vital that we always set both
relationships one way and then back
there's a big difference between both
relationships notebook which we will
create here is one to one which means
that one note can only be in one
notebook notes is one too many which
means that one notebook can have several
nodes let's stop for a moment and think
how these relationships will be mapped
once the entity is turned into a class a
one-to-one relationship such as notebook
will become a property of type notebook
so far so good what will happen to notes
it will become a property of type set a
set is similar to an array with it with
a few limitations there's no order and
no object can be repeated now that we
have both relationships created let's
make sure that we have both the direct
relationship and the inverse this is a
very important step and back to notebook
we need to make sure that the
relationship goes from note to note book
and now we have the two relationships
correct now move on to the next video
once you've added little relationships
to your data model</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
