you want information about your paternal
lineage from your Y chromosome so which
of the following relatives of your
father could use to determine his Y
chromosome background well your father's
son your brother would have the same y
chromosome so that would be an option
right you're related to him directly
your father's mother well father's
mother isn't going to be able to give
you information because she doesn't have
a Y chromosome so you can't trace your
paternal lineage that way what about
your father's brother right they should
share the same Y chromosome because they
share the same father so that would be
another good option your father's
brother son again sharing all the same y
chromosome should that be a good option
your father's sister's son well it is a
boy right a male that has a Y chromosome
but the problem is is he got the Y
chromosome not from your father's family
but from his father right because he's
related to your father through your
father's sister your aunt and she didn't
pass down the Y chromosome so this is a
break in the paternal lineage only the
first third and fourth options would be
appropriate here to find out more about
your paternal lineage</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
