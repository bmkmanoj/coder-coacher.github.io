get their hands on the best chocolate
pancakes in existence the way this works
is the person who's been in the line the
longest gets her pancakes and gets out
first people can join on this end but
only people on this end get their
pancakes in leave you could perhaps call
this a first-in first-out structure or a
queue a queue is kind of the opposite of
the stack in this way in a stack the
most recently added element comes out
first but here the oldest element comes
out first otherwise queues are actually
pretty similar to stacks the first
element in a queue or the oldest element
in the queue is called the head the last
element in the queue or the newest
element in the queue is called the tail
when you add an element to the tail the
operation is called NQ when you remove
the head element the operation is called
DQ there's also an operation called peak
where you look at the head element but
you don't actually remove it again you
can implement this data structure with a
linked list where you also save
references to the head and tail so you
can look them both up in constant time
there are actually two special types of
cues that show up a lot a deck or
double-ended queue is a queue that goes
both ways you can n queue or DQ from
either end if you think about it a deck
is kind of a generalized version of both
stacks and queues since you could
represent either of them with it you
could treat it like a stack and add and
remove elements from the same end or you
could treat it like a queue and add
elements on one end and remove them from
the other let's examine a priority queue
now in a priority queue you assign each
element a numerical priority when you
insert it into the queue when you dqu
remove the element with the highest
priority this doesn't really follow the
rules of a normal queue where you remove
the oldest element first however if the
elements have the same priority the
oldest element is the one that gets DQ'd
first</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
