connection opens well what has to happen
the two endpoints the client and server
have to get into agreement that a
connection exists well what information
has to be exchanged in order for that to
happen before anything happens the
client knows the server's IP address and
port number but the server doesn't know
anything about the client so the client
has to send the server a message with
among other things its IP address and
port number saying that it wants to
connect to the server on its IP in port
but TCP does more than that it also
keeps track of the data that each
endpoint is sent and make sure the other
endpoint has received it and make sure
the application sees that data in order
even if the underlying network reorders
the packets the way that it does this is
by putting a sequence number on each
packet each endpoint sends an
acknowledgment indicating when it's
received a particular sequence number
and if a packet goes missing the other
endpoint will notice there's no
acknowledgment and will retransmit it
also sequence numbers start out at a
random number so they're very unlikely
to get confused between one connection
and another so when the client sends
this first packet it has a sequence
number on it like number 1 2 3 4 5 and
when the server sends back its first
response that has a different sequence
number like 9 8 7 6
it also contains an acknowledgment
saying that the server has received
packets up to but not including number 1
2 3 4 6 and then subsequently each
packet either end sends has an
acknowledgment or ACK for short that
indicates 1 more than the greatest
sequence number for which it knows it
doesn't need anything resent when the
client sends the packet containing its
request the server acknowledges that
request even before it sends the
response then it will send the response
and the client will acknowledge each
packet that's used to send that for a
realistically sized file there would be
many many more of these before we're
done and since there will be many more
of these it's not just that the server
will be sending a lot of data to the
client the client will also be sending
an ACK back to the server for each
packet of that data and because that
data is going to be broken up into a lot
of packets each with its own sequence
number on it they're going to be a lot
of acts
going back even though the client isn't
transmitting any application data back
all those packets will have data length
zero they'll still be telling the server
how much data has been successfully
received</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
