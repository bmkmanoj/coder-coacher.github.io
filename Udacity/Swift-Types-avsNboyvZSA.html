you to open up a playground file like
this one that file will contain the
examples I will walk through so you can
follow along a second file will contain
exercises for you to do on your own you
can download all the files for the
course from the link in the instructors
notes at the beginning of each lesson go
ahead and download the playground files
for lesson one now then open up the file
entitled lesson 1 types and operators if
your playground doesn't look like this
but instead has a bunch of green
comments you'll want to change one of
the settings up here in the editor menu
go down to here where where my menu says
show raw markup yours might say show
rendered markup so you'll want to click
on it if it says show rendered markup
then it should look like this
I'm going to start by quickly running
through the definitions of Swift's
primitive types so if primitive types
don't have too many surprises here in
this light switch class the on-property
is a bool Swift boolean x' always have a
value of true or false
they can't be assigned to 0 or 1 as in c
or yes or no as an objective-c if you
don't recognize any of this syntax don't
worry that's to be expected
I'll explain class and property
definitions soon along with this dot
syntax for now just focus on the data
types for properties that need to hold
continuous values we might want to use
the int type which holds an integer for
example if our light switch had a dimmer
I'll give our light switch of dimmer
property and then I'll set that dimmer
property to be of type int what if we
wanted to set our dimmer to PI if we
want this dimmer property to be able to
represent decimals we can try using a
float instead of an int of course if we
use a double then we can get a more
precise for a presentation of pi here
I've carried it out to 11 digits between
float and double you can decide which
type to use based on the level of
precision you need strings and
characters in Swift are pretty much as
you would expect
naturally the character type holds a
single character and the string type
represents an ordered collection of
characters the Swift string type comes
with a handy bag of tricks
they make string manipulations nice and
concise
like this simple string concatenation
here in the playground sidebar you can
see the concatenated stream we'll have
more fun with strings in the exercises
at the end of the lesson there are two
other Swift types that require a deeper
dive the first is the optional type
which is the focus of the next lesson
and the second is tuples which we'll
talk about in the collections lesson for
now just know of their existence before
we finish there's a secret I haven't
revealed see how I've indicated the type
for each of these variables I can
actually take all of these type
indicators out but the compiler is
having no problem inferring the correct
type and we can even test that by taking
a look at the type of these variables
let's try this concatenated string this
dynamic type property can be used to
investigate any objects type and we can
see over here in the sidebar that the
type of concatenated string is a swift
string and the compiler was able to
infer that even though we didn't
indicate it directly in the definition
in the upcoming quiz you get to play the
role of compiler and do some type
inference of your own</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
