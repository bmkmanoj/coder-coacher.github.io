wins a game of tic-tac-toe you'll need
to tell the computer what a winning
tic-tac-toe grid looks like in the code
you've been given the tic-tac-toe grid
is a 3x3 2d array of characters that
keeps track of where or if an X or o has
been played when you first start a game
the grid has 9 empty spots and as you
play the spots fill up with the symbols
X and O so at any time a spot can either
be empty have an X in it or have an own
it and in our code the grid array keeps
track of these 3 possibilities with
three different characters an empty spot
is represented by the dash character and
X's and O's are just their own lowercase
letter and each character in this grid
is stored in an index in our 2d array
this top left empty character is at the
pair of indices 0 0 and to access this
character value in code we write grid 0
0 so right now grid at the index 0 0 is
equal to a - character because it's an
empty spot and right next to this spot
is grid 1 0 and grid 2 0 and these are
also - characters because this whole row
is empty but if there was an X at the
index to 0 instead then grid to 0 would
equal the X character now what about
these other spots
well the spot right below 0 0 is 0 1 can
you guess what the indices will be for
this bottom left corner this pair of
indices will be 0 - and you might be
noticing a pattern to access the
character at any position in this grid
we can basically treat these indices as
XY coordinates but in programming
instead of using x and y it's common to
use I and J so let's say we have integer
variables I and J that are coordinate
positions in our grid so for the pair of
indices grid I and J I keeps track of
which column were in in our array 0 1 or
2 counting from left to right and J
keeps track of which row were in
counting from top to bottom
again zero one or two so the center spot
of our grid is at the index 1 1 and the
bottom right corner is grid 2 2 and so
on for the rest of the characters in our
grid they're at the index I J so right
now grid 1 1 and grid 2 2 are equal to
the - character because they're empty
spots but say there's an O symbol here
then grid 2 to this bottom right corner
will be equal to the character oh let's
get more practice visualizing a 2d array
like this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
