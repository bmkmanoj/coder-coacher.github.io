these two formulas David I did and on
the one on the Left we find it's a
little bit easier because it starts with
a hand which means any time a is false
we can go ahead and write that this is
false when a is true that means we can
ignore it and evaluate solely based on B
or C whenever either of them is true the
result is true and only when both of
them are faults is the result faults so
the one on the right is a little bit
more complicated because for each of
them we need to look at both a and B and
a and C but because there's an or in the
middle that means once we discover that
one of them is true we don't need to
really worry about the other one a and B
is true whenever both a and B are true
and so a and B R true here and here
maybe we can go ahead and say that those
are true we don't need to look at a and
C here similarly a and C or true here so
we can go ahead and say that this one is
true as well for all the ones at the
bottom a is false which means it's going
to go ahead and render both of them
faults and for the fourth one B and C
are both faults meaning each
individually is going to become false so
what we see here is that the truth
values for these two formulas actually
end at the same so I guess they're
equivalent as well good David so this
property is called the distributive
property the distributive property says
that these two formulas have the same
truth values or in particular if there
is B and C inside the parentheses with a
disjunction between them and a is
outside the parentheses with a
conjunction between them then we can
move a inside the parentheses by first
writing a and B and then writing a and C
and taking the disjunction of the two we
can also think of this as distributing
the part outside both the predicate and
the operator into both the ones on the
inside we take the a and and apply it to
be so a and B we take the a and and
apply it to see so a and C and we
preserve the operator in between B and C
in between the two new parentheses so if
this had been a or b or c this will
become a or b or b or c this had become
a and B and C and would be all the
operators here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
