and for now we'll be focusing on vertex
cover and on independent set so let's
say we're given a graph with n vertices
and we're looking at the smallest
possible vertex cover so a minimum
vertex cover for that graph and for the
largest possible independent set so a
maximum independent set so let's say the
size of the minimum vertex cover for
this graph here is K so some integer
smaller than n and then and you know
this from the reduction between vertex
cover and independent set the largest
possible independent set that we can
find in this graph has size n minus K so
now instead of finding the smallest
possible vertex cover let's run the
factor two approximation algorithm and
that algorithm will give us some number
and that number is guaranteed to be less
than or equal to 2k and what that means
for the independent set of course is if
we take those n vertices here and take
away those 2k vertices then of course we
still arrive at an independent set and
that independent set has a size of at
least n minus 2k because the size of the
vertex cover and of the independent set
always add up to n so this here would be
the optimum solution and this here would
be what the vertex cover factor two
approximation finds so what about the
approximation factor so you already know
that for vertex cover we have a factor
two approximation and the way you arrive
at the two is of course since this is a
minimization problem you take what the
approximation finds and divided by the
size of the optimum solutions so it's
basically two K over K and as equal to
two now what about independent set so
independent set is a maximization
problem so for vertex cover we took what
the algorithm finds and divided it by
the size of the optimum solution but
that was because it was a minimization
problem for a maximization problem given
how we define approximation factors
we'll have to do it just the other way
around so the approximation factor here
is the size of the optimum solution
divided by what the approximation
actually finds so it's divided by n
minus 2k which is equal to 1 plus K over
N minus 2k
the factor-2 approximation algorithm for
vertex cover is actually a factor 1 plus
K over N minus 2 K approximation
algorithm for independent set</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
