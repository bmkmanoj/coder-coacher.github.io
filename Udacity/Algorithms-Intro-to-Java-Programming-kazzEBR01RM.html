very simple programs and how to correct
errors and to deal with all sorts of
fuzzy details let's step back a little
bit and think about what a computer can
do for us a computer can execute an
algorithm that's a technical term for a
recipe of instructions that are
unambiguous executable and terminating
or those are big words so let's see
what's going on unambiguous means that
the recipe can be interpreted in only
one way
executable means that it steps of those
that a computer can actually carry out
and terminating of course means that
they come to an end that's all pretty
abstract let's look at a concrete
situation you need to buy a car you have
two choices
this beauty over here it's cheap but it
has terrible gas mileage or this sleek
one over here expensive but great
mileage which is the better Buy I'll
show you an algorithm that makes that
decision the first car costs $15,000 and
the second car costs $30,000 so it looks
like we should buy the first car but not
so fast the first car gets 10 miles per
gallon and the second car 50 miles per
gallon so what do you think which car
should I buy do you think I should go
for car one or for car two or in the end
doesn't it really matter or maybe you
don't have enough information to give an
exact answer tell me what you think</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
