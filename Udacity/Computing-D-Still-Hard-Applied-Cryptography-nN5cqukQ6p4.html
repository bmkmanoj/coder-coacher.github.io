there isn't an easier way to compute D
than finding the factors of n this
follows from what we just showed that if
we know the totient we could easily find
the factors because the correctness of
RSA depends on this property that means
that there's some integer K such that K
times the totient of n is equal to e d
minus 1 which means well we already know
the value of e we're assuming now that
we figure out a way to compute D if we
can solve this then we know a multiple
of the totient once we know a multiple
of the totient it's easy to find the
factors p and q so if there were some
easier way to find d then factoring the
modulus that would provide an easy way
to factor so we finished showing that
all the at least all the obvious
mathematical ways of breaking RSA would
easily allow us to factor in this
certainly doesn't cover issues in
implementation or issues in weak choices
of messages or keys but assuming all of
those things are good then we've shown
that all the obvious mathematical ways
to break our essay or equivalent to
factoring it so that means affecting its
hard breaking RSA would be hard so
that's the second part of this claim is
that factoring is indeed hard</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
