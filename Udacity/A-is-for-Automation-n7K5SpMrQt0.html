is automation whenever you write a piece
of code to perform a task that otherwise
you do by hand that counts as automation
there are a lot of steps of both
development and operations processes
that can be automated one big one is
deployment setting up a server to run an
application once upon a time sis
administered spend a lot of time setting
up physical servers individually and
when you needed to install software
upgrades you'd log into each machine and
run the upgrade now smart operations
people would automate as much of this as
possible like throw together a shell
script that logs into each server and
runs the upgrade but that kind of work
generally wasn't visible outside of Ops
it was something that ops did to make
their own job easier but it wasn't
recognized as a vital function of the
organization but today on the other hand
you don't have one or two physical
servers for an application you might
have dozens of server instances on a
cloud platform or you might have
hundreds to support a large and popular
application at that scale you can't
reasonably manage them by hand at all
you need automation just to get the job
done now on the development side of
things there are also a bunch of things
that can be automated this isn't really
new with DevOps the agile movement
embraced unit testing acceptance testing
and continuous integration but DevOps
ties these into the deployment process
eliminating the boundary between
developer side automation and operation
side automation after all if we're both
working on the same service why should
we have two incompatible views of it now
we'll be talking more about automation
in lessons two and three and you'll get
some hands-on experience with automating
parts of the testing and deployment
workflow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
