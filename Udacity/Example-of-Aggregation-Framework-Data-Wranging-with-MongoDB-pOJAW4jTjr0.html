using the aggregation framework to
answer some questions about our data
let's find out how we could use the
aggregation framework to determine which
user in our data set has produced the
most tweets now let's talk about the
process we would like the database to
perform for us so given the way our data
is laid out the first thing we're going
to want to do is group the tweets by
user remember each tweet has the user as
a field within it then we're going to
want to count each user's tweets and
finally select the user with the most
tweets now let's rethink this third step
what's probably going to be most
valuable is not just seeing the one
person who's tweeted the most but
instead counting the number of tweets
for each user and then sorting them if
we sort into descending order the person
at the top will be the one with the most
tweets
so our process is really group all
tweets by user count each user's tweets
sort into descending order and then
select the user at the top okay
so with this process outlined let's take
a look at how we would express this in
the aggregation framework and we'll use
this as an example to launch our
exploration of the aggregation framework
in MongoDB okay so aggregation queries
in MongoDB are issued using the
aggregate command and we'll talk about
this in just a bit but aggregations are
done with a pipeline and a pipeline is
essentially a series of stages that are
included as elements of an array that's
passed to aggregate as a parameter okay
so the first thing we need to do is
group now here we're going to use the
group operator in this first stage of
our aggregation pipeline and the way
we're going to group is based on a
user's screen name let's briefly go back
and take a look at the data remember
that all of our tweets have a user field
and that user field is actually a nested
document that contains a screen name
okay so if we go back to our aggregation
weary we can see that we're saying for
the user sub document I want the screen
name field okay so what's this about
well this isn't an operator instead what
this means is even though it's inside
quotes don't interpret this as a string
that is to say don't make the ID user
dot screen underscore name rather group
together all documents where the value
of screen name for the user sub document
that's what this dollar says should
happen here or the value of this is the
same so all tweets that have this the
same value for this field will be
grouped together and then we need an
accumulator of some kind there are a
number of different accumulator
operators that we can use what this
means is for every document that has the
same value for this field increment this
value count by one that's the semantics
of this so this accomplishes those first
two steps that we talked about here
group tweets by user and count each
user's tweets then the next thing that's
going to happen is we'll simply do a
sort and this says sort based on the
count of the documents that are passed
into this stage and sort into descending
order okay what do I mean by the
documents passed into this stage well
the reason why this is called a pipeline
is because each stage receives a set of
input documents and produces a set of
output documents and we'll talk a little
bit more about that later the input
documents to the stage that uses this
sort operator are the documents output
by the stage that uses the group
operator so what we end up with for this
stage is a bunch of documents that have
an underscore ID field and a count field
and this stage of the pipeline is going
to sort those documents based on the
value of their count field okay now if
you didn't catch all that don't worry
about it because we are going to dive
into all the bits and pieces here as we
move through this lesson let's go ahead
and run this code and see what it
produces now I'm simply going to pipe
this to the assistant program less so
that I can see the very top of the
results that are produced
okay the results from an aggregation
query are always a single document it is
the result field of that return document
that we're interested in and here we can
see that what was outputted are exactly
the documents that were passed to the
sort stage of our aggregation query they
each have an underscore ID field and
account associated with them and they've
been sorted into descending order now
note that there's only eight or rather
that the maximum number of tweets for an
individual user is eight okay this
dataset is a snapshot from a relatively
short period of time so that's why these
counts are fairly small as we move
through this lesson we'll take a closer
look at the aggregation pipeline at what
it means to have stages within that
pipeline and at the various aggregation
operators that are available to us as
well as other operators such as
accumulator operators that we can use in
the group stage and other sorts of
operators we use elsewhere in
aggregation queries</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
