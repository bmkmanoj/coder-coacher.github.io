operating system design that we have
discussed the four functionalities in
the tornado operating system are
contained in these clustered objects and
these clustered objects have to
communicate with one another in order to
implement the services because it's not
a monolithic kernel anymore
it's a microkernel with the
functionalities contained in these
objects and so we need efficient inter
process communication via object calls
that goes between an object that can be
a client and it can be thought of as a
client and an object that can be thought
of as a server for instance the FCM
object may need to contact the DRAM
object in order to get a page frame so
in that case the FCM object is a client
and the DM object is the server that is
serving the request and the way that
request is satisfied is through those
IPC realized by a protected procedure
called mechanism and if the calling
object and the called object the client
and the server they are on the same
processor then tornado uses a hand of
scheduling between the calling object
and the called object it's very similar
to what we discussed in the lrpc paper
on how we can have efficient
communication without a context switch
so local protected procedure call you
don't have to have a context switch
because you can implement this by hand
off scheduling between the calling
object and the called object on the
other hand if the called object is on a
remote processor then you have to have a
full context switch in order to go
across to the other processor and
execute the protective procedure call
and this IPC mechanism is fundamental to
the tornado system both for implementing
any service as a collection of clustered
objects and even for managing the
replicas of objects so for instance I
mentioned that you might decide based on
usage pattern that I want to have
replicas of the region object which
represents a particular portion of the
address base
if you have a region object that is
replicated its equivalent to a page
table has mappings between virtual pages
and physical pages if I replicate it
then I have to make sure that the
replicas remain consistent whose job is
it
it is a job of the clustered object
implementation to make sure that the
replicas are kept consistent so when you
modify one replica you have to make a
particular procedure call to the other
replicas to reflect the change that you
made in the first replica so all of
these are things that are happening
under the cover so the key thing that
you'll notice is that all of the
management of replicas and so on is
managed in software we're not we're not
relying on the hardware cache coherence
because hardware cache coherence only
works on physical memory now if we
replicated the physical memory is not
the same anymore it is a replica that is
known only to the software the system
software sort of the management of that
replica that is that has to be managed
by the operating system</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
