like it okay good I'm glad I nice likes
it so okay so a question about the
upcoming classes me this a lot will they
also be using Python and yes they will
so we have four new classes that will be
starting in April will also be reoffer
includes that if you complete 10 when
and understand what we do in 11 you'll
be ready to take those I think they're
three really exciting courses one will
be about building web applications and
that's going to be taught by Steve
Huffman who is the co-founder of Reddit
and as well as him luck yes which are
two of the coolest websites if you
haven't checked those up I encourage you
to do so one will be a programming
languages course that will use the goal
of building a web browser to focus the
course and that's going to be taught by
it by Wes one work who's been out here
recording parts of that class this week
so that's going to be a terrific class
and the third of the 200 level courses
is going to be taught by Peter Norvig
and he's a really a legendary programmer
and is going to look at sort of ways of
using Python in more advanced than what
we do in cs101 to solve a whole range of
interesting problems and the fourth
class that will be offered will also use
Python this of course that i'm going to
teach an applied cryptography and that
course is going to be a 300 level course
if you have fairly good confidence in
math the python program that we use will
not go beyond what you've learned in 101
so you would be able to take that class
i'm going to assume a little bit more
math background then you might have
otherwise but it won't assume any more
programming background than you'll have
from 101 does anyone have a question
come up to that one if we take the three
to 200 level classes what would your
goal be for what we'd be able to do in
our own once we've done that so if you
take all of them at once well yes
arresting some dangers okay great yeah
if you if you take all of them at once I
think you'll be very tired I think
feather
I commend anyone who wants to attempt to
take all three at once you're certainly
allowed to and welcome to I think it's
going to be a each one of those is going
to be a success so I think it's going to
be really hard to take all three but
they will be offered again so our plan
is to keep offering the courses every a
week cycle so whichever one or two you
can take starting in April you'll have a
chance to take the other ones starting
in June and each of those courses has a
different goal in terms of what material
it covers definitely if you take all
three you'll be quite an experienced
programmer you really be able to build
and understand complex programs the goal
for the web applicants course is by the
end of that course you'll be able to
build a web application you'll be able
to yoga you'll be able to you will help
build one and it will be a blog it will
have user accounts you'll learn how to
use API is to interact with other
websites like Facebook API and you'll
learn about how to make it scale which
since Steve Huffman is teaching it he's
built websites that scale veteran so
that many millions of users so I think
that that would be really interesting if
you take the permian languages course at
the end of that you'll understand how to
build an interpreter so it's focused
around a browser but the core part of a
browser that interprets the JavaScript
programs that are in the browser and
javascript is a language fairly similar
to python that runs inside almost all
web browsers today and what you'll do in
that class is build an interpreter that
can handle not all of javascript but a
core of JavaScript enough to really
understand how to interpret group org
and you'll also you won't be building an
interpreter for Python in that class but
you'll have a much better understanding
of what's going on behind the scenes
when you run a python program from
having built a JavaScript interpreter as
well okay anyone else have a question
okay so the question is about for the
the cs 101 class being offered in april
will it be a rebroadcast as an exact
class or taught live again and i guess
none of that the lectures are actually
live now right there there's a lot of
editing that goes into producing the
lectures when the course is reoffer will
be reusing a lot of the content probably
most of the lecture content will be
reused the things that we have ideas how
to do better than we did this time we'll
try to improve many of the problems from
the homeworks some will be reused some
will have new problems so our goal is to
take advantage of the content that we've
developed and to be able to use that
taught for the course again but it will
still be the experience similar to this
one where where we do hope to have a
group of students going through the
course together doing the homework
together we haven't figured out exactly
how to manage the forums that we have
from this year's this offering of the
course starting new forms or having ways
to access the old forms and maybe have
them scheduled along with the course we
don't plan on getting the olefin right
we don't want to really throw the whole
formas we don't just content up but we
also don't want the students taking the
Apple course to see the answers to the
questions before they have a chance to
have their own discussions and figure
them at themselves so we haven't figured
out exactly how we're going to do that
but we'll try to make it so so it feels
like you know students were going
through a class together that's a real
class running at the same time but still
taking advantage of all the content in
being able to improve the content based
on what we've learned from all of you
from taking it this time all right
what exactly is a brook so the
motivation so this is a question about
what's the purpose of the grading um and
and it is really up to you if you care
about the grading so you know we're
providing grading for many students I
think that makes it feel more like a
real class it's a motivating factor it
is the case that students who do do the
homeworks on the deadline and take the
exam the ones who get above the
threshold will get a certificate and
based on how well they do they can get a
certificate that indicates that we also
have a long-term plan at least long term
meaning this year to have enough courses
that you'd be able to do something
comparable to a top-level university
degree taking courses through Udacity
and students who are doing that because
they want to build a transcript they
want to be able to get a job they want
to have something they can show to an
employer that shows here's what I've
learned it this demonstrates my ability
from having grades in these classes
having grades that are meaningful will
help us do that and so I see a lot of
stress on the forms and in emails to me
about the grades and you know if you're
taking the class because you want to
learn to program and you're not worried
about that that's perfectly okay and and
I hope people don't get too stressed up
about the grades that it's really about
learning but for students who do want to
pursue something like a complete CS
degree or take a large set of courses
with us and build a transcript then the
grades will start to be meaningful and
valuable and probably you know from 101
that's not going to be enough to have a
transcript for at least most employers
having just had the one class that
degrade in that class won't matter too
much but I think it is a motivator and I
hope people will value the certificates
that they get because you know it is a
lot of work to do well in the class and
we definitely appreciate your efforts
and want to recognize them
okay huh Korean sorry I didn't hear you
I'd uh audio muted so did you for your
question how's it go um what what
programming languages will be offering
courses and after this one um so it's a
good question i don't answer that yet
we're working on planning the june
courses we don't have anything ready to
announce about those courses yet we will
definitely eventually have some portions
that use languages other than Python but
all the courses we have planned now are
still using Python</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
