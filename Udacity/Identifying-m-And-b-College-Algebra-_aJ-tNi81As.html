the coefficient in front of the term
with an X to the first so in the first
equation y equals 100 plus 50 X M is
just 50 there are two little potentially
tricky spots here since in the second to
last question we have y equals 12 minus
3x m is equal to negative 3 since you
will call that in the form of the
equation the general form wave y equals
MX and no sign in front of the M so we
need to include the sign as part of the
coefficient the second potentially
tricky thing is for the equation y
equals 5 we don't have a term here with
an X what that really means is that we
have the term plus 0x add it on to the
end of this clearly 0x is just equal to
zero but writing this lets us see that M
the slope here is actually equal to 0
this actually makes sense since y equals
5 is just a horizontal line whose slope
is 0 moving on to our values of B these
are just the constant terms on the right
side of each of these equations negative
science need to be included as part of
the B term and in the equation y equals
5x since we don't explicitly see a
constant term added out here B must be
equal to zero having this information
written out explicitly like this makes
writing the equations in y equals MX
plus B form pretty simple hopefully now
you feel very confident that all these
equations can be written in this precise
form</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
