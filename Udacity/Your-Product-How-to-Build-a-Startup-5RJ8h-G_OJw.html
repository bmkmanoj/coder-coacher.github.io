last slide the real question for you is
how does your product get to the
customer and I think the real questions
start with what type of product do I
have to have a product made out of bits
that is is it virtual or is my product a
physical product and I think that's a
simple choice you need to make right now
is your product physical or is it bits
the next thing you need to ask is what's
going to be my distribution channel is
it going to be direct that is am I going
to either offer it on a website I own or
have direct sales people that work for
me or is it could be indirect theirs am
I going to put it on a third-party
website like on Amazon or a web
aggregator or physically am I going to
use system integrators or VARs or some
other indirect channel like a retail
store so just select what you think will
work for your product and so later on
the lecture will analyze the potential
choices for you to pick for your product</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
