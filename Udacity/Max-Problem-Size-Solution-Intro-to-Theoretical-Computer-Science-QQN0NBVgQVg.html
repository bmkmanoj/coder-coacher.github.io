using logarithms so you say 2 to the
power of n for example smaller than 1
billion which means that n must be
smaller than the logarithm base 2 of 1
billion so it must be smaller than or
equal to 29 which is exactly what we're
going to put you and of course you can
do the same calculation for the other
ones as well so you get here the maximum
problem size we can handle would be n
equals 217 here it's 119 108 and 51 now
the interesting thing to see here I
think is that you see how even small
changes in the base of the exponent can
make a difference so here the change is
really small from one point to one down
to one point 18 and already we could
handle a problem size of 10 more and of
course it also shows you that the
problem size that you can handle at
least in a worst-case scenario is about
four times as much as you could handle
if you used a normal search tree and of
course if you could find a really really
good search tree and there are some
problems for which you can come close to
1.1 actually then you can have the
problem sizes that are almost twice as
much as this one over here so it's
really a significant improvement it's
not dramatic in the way that now we
could solve instance sizes of thousands
of vertices or thousands of variables
but it's a significant improvement but
it's a significant improvement through
using sophisticated algorithms</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
