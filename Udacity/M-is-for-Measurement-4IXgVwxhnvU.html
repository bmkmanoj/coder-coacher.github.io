is another core part of DevOps if you
want to improve something you have to be
able to measure it for instance suppose
that a new software release is expected
to make the application faster how would
you know whether it actually does make
it faster it's not very rational to say
I expect it to be better therefore it's
going to necessarily be better sometimes
even an expert is wrong so when we want
to know how the service is doing or
whether we've improved it we look to
take measurements of its performance now
in traditional IT organizations
infrastructure monitoring has been an
OPS responsibility this includes things
like noticing if a server has crashed or
if an application is unavailable or if a
disk is filling up but that's a pretty
limited view on what's worth measuring
the service is a lot more than just the
servers with participation from the
development team we can get much better
monitoring developers can make sure that
applications export useful data and they
can write services with an eye to making
them integrate with systems for
recording and analyzing that data and we
can also plug monitoring into the
release process for instance if a new
release causes the software to slow down
maybe we want to roll it back or even
simpler if we know that traffic to our
service is lowest at a particular time
of day maybe that's the best time to do
a release but measurement actually goes
beyond even Devon ops we can use the
same measurement tools to record
business metrics things like customer
activity transactions per second even
measurements of customer happiness and
we could also measure the effectiveness
of our own tools for instance some dude
in a purple t-shirt might tell you that
using certain deployment tools will let
you do releases a lot faster but why
should you trust that guy you can
measure it and find out for sure on the
operations side we can talk about
measuring errors and failures and find
out whether these new practices were
adopting or actually reducing them now
we'll talk some more about measurement
in lesson 3 where you get some more
in-depth look at monitoring and some
hands-on experience as well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
