I wanted to tell you about do you wanna
help me remember what we learned what
did we talk about so we talked about
clustering as an idea which is sort of a
pretty powerful one and I guess we
connected that to the notion of compact
description and we talked about a bunch
of algorithms and in particular we
talked about k-means and single linkage
clustering that's right and there was
another one ium yes and the big
difference between eeehm and the other
two is that iam makes for soft clusters
versus hard clusters yeah that's one
distinction you could also say that the
difference between single and clustering
and the others is it actually terminates
in polynomial time hmm doesn't k-means
terminate kind of fast I don't think we
know exactly I think it could run
through a lot of different
configurations before it stops so we
talked about some algorithms and then we
did something rather startling and we
showed that clustering is in some sense
impossible right which is silly because
we know that it's possible we do it all
the time but we can't have those
particular three properties all at once
that axiomatization is mutually
contradictory mm-hmm yeah I think I
think that's about it so I'm ready to
move on to some other unsupervised
topics no cool me too
all right well thanks Michael I learned
a lot sure yeah well I think next time
you're gonna tell me about something
features I'm gonna tell you about
something
features all right well I'm looking
forward to something features okay bye
Michael yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
