you know how sometimes you walk up to
the trunk and your hands are full well
here's how you do it that's really cool
can I try so were you kicking something
how do you think it was there a
particular place hmm what do you think
is going up oh they're just so what did
you do I'm not sure what I did you think
you could do it again well I don't know
let's see what what I did so what's your
conceptual model what's going on
maybe there's a sensor there and I have
to somewhere yeah somewhere under there
mmm it looks like they know this is a
really good example if you like it's a
good example of a bad example of
crossing the Gulf of execution and the
Gulf of evaluation the Gulf of execution
well I'm supposed to kick or something
but where and how how fast or do I kick
could just wave my foot and the Gulf of
execution well I did it and nothing
happened now what am I supposed to do a
really good example of bad design</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
