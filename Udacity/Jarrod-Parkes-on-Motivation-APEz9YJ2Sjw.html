developer at Udacity at Jared thanks so
much for talking to us today thanks for
having me we're gonna talk a little bit
about student motivation in classes and
how technology can help I'll so Jared
I'll start by asking what kind of shaped
you as far as motivation is concerned
when you were back when you were a
learner in school so what were your
experiences with the role of motivation
in education right I was at a kind of
lucky situation I'm a twin so for me a
lot of my motivation i think was always
driven out of that natural sense of
competition that I had with my twin
brother James but from more of like what
the school was providing for me I think
I was always motivated by doing well it
was always stressed that you want to do
well so I tried to get to the top and
for me that that seemed to be enough at
least to give me through grade school
and then as learning got deeper and the
topics got more difficult I had to kind
of dig I think more inside of myself to
find the time and give the commitment to
the topics that you had to to be
successful I think you're echoing
something really important also is that
and there's actually research that backs
this up is that early and education
students might adopt a real focus on
some of those external motivators and
sounds like you commenting on that the
early on it was about doing well overall
according to I'm guessing what was your
definition of doing well back then do
you remember it was very much get a's in
class I mean it was out my parents made
it known to my brother and I at a very
early age that we had to do well in
order to be able to get to college and
you know so that for me was a goal from
I don't know fifth grade and on
something like that yes I think there's
research that confirms that early on
many students adopt this kind of
external mindset about learning which
isn't inherently a bad thing because
there are powerful external motivators
out in the world and there are very
important reasons to learn well and do
well but what about the detention
between I think you mentioned this as
our later in your career the tension
between being motivated by something out
in the world and being motivated by
something more internal to yourself I
think that started to arise when I got
two points where I started to question
where the grades that I was getting in
class and receiving
truly reflective of how i felt i was
learning or how i felt like just self
worth and value like I I feel like I'm
trying hard but I don't know if I want
to commit the amount of time it takes to
get what is considered an a a high mark
in this class whereas you know I feel
like I'm still learning effectively and
this is just added pressure and so I
think intrinsically in and of myself I
started to think about why am i learning
why do I want to learn I'm actually
having fun doing this and then I started
to go after and learn and look at topics
that excited me not just because
somebody told me they was well this is
what I should be interested but because
I chose them for myself it's interesting
because you're commenting on that I
think a lot of students experience that
same thing where they find something
that's fair that they're very passionate
about and they end up pursuing it but it
seems like it would be really great if
we could actually bring that into the
classroom at least in my opinion there's
nothing inherent about the classroom
that means students can't be internally
motivated by something a teacher gives
them it's you know that fact I got it
from a teacher doesn't make it so that
I'm never going to be personally
interested in it it's just something
happens i think in school that often
prevents that from arising so you have
any thoughts on either from your
personal experience or what we as
educational technology designers could
do to try and create that more personal
motivation even when we're designing
well-formed interventions I think you
have to keep adaptivity at one of the
highest priorities i think the classroom
and a lot of ways says for a lot of
people been very rigid and because of
that when they find something that may
be interesting maybe they feel silenced
or they don't feel like they can go and
explore this topic and it's going to
help them and getting higher or
finishing school or whatever and so
being able to identify when students
have something that they're very
interested in and then allowing them to
pursue that and still somehow maybe tie
it back to whatever the universal
messages of this class or the learning
points is something that I think would
be very beneficial they're saying be
good to have a class where students can
kind of be given a bunch of topics to
explore and choose which topics they
they'd like to explore and win and how
yes you know as long as there I think of
dense enough and they're ones that
actually would merit you know a good
amount of work and you can make those
calls as an educator
then yeah that would be great type of
cloud those are the kind of classes i
enjoyed no so Jarrod would enjoy this
class so you don't know this but that's
exactly the motivating principle behind
the design of this classes we've given
students a library of information such
as this interview to explore and kind of
find what's most interesting and
pertinent to them all right so um but
what about the role technology in all
this it seems like everything we talked
about so far is kind of general to
education the classroom as a whole what
can technology do specifically to help
us with this you know facilitating
students personal motivation these
topics so one thing I think about is how
technology nowadays has access to so
much information and because they have
access to information when students are
being when we're collecting responses
from students and we're analyzing their
feedback their answers or whatever we
can look at those things and make
choices about or give them
recommendations about things that they
may become interested in so the
technology is what would allow us to
adapt where it may be more difficult in
a traditional classroom for professor to
give that individual attention to each
student I think that's something that
technology could definitely do not agree
i think the technology also has the
benefit of making a lot of these
resources always very easily available
that in the past it was a case of if i
wanted you know structure class where
students can choose their own topic i
could say today in class you're going to
go to the library find the encyclopedia
find a book and research it yourself but
that means that students have 15 minutes
one day to do all the research and find
their own direction which is really
enough time but now we can say you know
you have all semester you have the
internet you have as much time as you're
willing to invest you can go any
direction you want without ever leaving
your office alright so I think that's
really powerful to making that available
I'm do you have any thoughts on the role
of artificial intelligence and it's not
know if you have any experience with how
AI can kind of help personalize this and
if you don't all comment on it but I
don't have any deep experience but I
think AI systems can be the ones
responsible for finding those things
that in making those recommendations for
students I think that might be a good
application for end of mine is actually
working a project kinda like that is a
digital assistant for research like this
that if you're working on something it
can actually connect you out to ongoing
research in the field or similar ideas
or just help you kind of build a broader
knowledge of what you're researching
without having to
find everything on your own so I'm doing
final thoughts for our students who
might be worried about facilitating
motivation in the technological devices
that they built yes my recommendation is
for any roadblocks that you ever run
into motivation standpoint is to have
friends have people around you to
support you I think every time that I
reached one of those blocks in my life
that's what helped pull me through more
than anything else actually speaks I
think something we've commented
elsewhere in this class on as well is
that when we're building technology we
need to be able to facilitate
interaction among students it's it's
very tempting to treat my system as the
student and whatever I'm building but in
reality it should be the student their
friends their teachers their mentors
things like that and my device which is
facilitating interaction amongst all of
them no yeah it's almost like the
intrinsic motivation that grows out of
us as well as the extrinsic motivators I
think it's driven by people it's a
people based thing mmm absolutely well
great well thank you so much for talking
to us today absolutely and takes off for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
