and here I've written a simple test
function so what does it do it iterates
through each of the possible examples it
prints out what the example is the
original formula then it uses the time
call function that we defined in the
previous lesson and it calls solve on
the example and gets back the time it
took and the possible result and prints
that out and then in the end and it
prints out the total elapsed time and
does that by starting a timer at the
start and taking a timer at the end and
just calculating the difference so it's
going to tell me for each example what
the answer is how long it took for that
example and how long it took for all of
them together and here's the results of
the test so for each example we see the
example printed and then the filled-in
example found and you can verify that
that is in fact correct and it took a
tenth of a second or so some of them
take less when there's only one variable
it's really fast here we find these
Pythagorean triplets of three squared
plus 4 squared equals 5 squared + 5 12 5
squared plus 12 squared equals 13
squared so notice that we've gone beyond
the most simple of crypt arithmetic
problems which were just word plus word
equals another word here we can allow
division and exponentiation over here
I've been even more complicated where
I've come up with a to the n plus B the
N equals e to the n and n is greater
than 1 and the lower case letters I have
not translated because I said the only
letters that count as being translated
by digits are going to be the upper case
ones so i can use any of this Python
syntax like the the hand operator now if
you can find a solution for this when n
is greater than 2 I want you to let me
know but here i found one when n is
greater than 1 I've split the atom I've
determined that all that glitters is not
gold
I've determined that one is less than 2
and 4 is less than five and you can see
a bunch of other equations that I've
been able to process including odd + odd
equals even and for these 14 different
examples it took two seconds so not too
bad</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
