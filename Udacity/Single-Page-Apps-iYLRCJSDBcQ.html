self-contained a page that has its own
user interface and logic it can talk to
the server to send and receive data then
store that data locally you can
immediately interact with the data by
modifying the leading or creating new
content it's fast and there are no page
reloads you've already played around
with to do MVC but I want to quickly
focus on this MV see what is it MVC
stands for Model View controller and is
common design pattern for organizing
software of any kind including web apps
many frameworks provide a means for
creating and managing models views and
controllers model refers to a data model
it's everything from the user
information to any data that you might
want to see view is what users see and
interact with for a website the view is
essentially any HTML CSS and JavaScript
that controls how page looks and behaves
last is the controller this is the brain
of your application it sits between the
model and the view and this in charge of
passing data between them it contains
all the templating logic routing logic
and anything else that makes your app
unique if you want a refresher on MVC i
highly recommend checking out our course
javascript design patterns or the link
in the instructor notes okay now back to
to do MVC when I add this item as a new
task I'm interacting with the apps of
you but the controller is watching this
and is saving what I enter to the model
we've looked at single page applications
in action and looked at a common way to
architect them but how do frameworks fit
into this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
