are the ones that are more accurate
pictures of faces certainly do have many
pixels a 1 megapixel camera will have a
million input features if you're using
it in the raw input space so this is
really prime to get some reduction
somehow because a million features would
be really difficult for say an SVM to
handle the second thing that's true is
that there's some underlying patterns in
faces that is really well-suited for PCA
so since we think that there are just a
few underlying latent variables so in
the example of a 1 megapixel image I
wouldn't say that there's a million
points of difference between two faces
that there will just be a few general
points of difference and that may be pca
can confuse those out and use them to
their maximum ability and the third
thing that I wouldn't say is true is
that facial recognition is simple using
machine learning for example a decision
tree will have a lot of difficulty
trying to do facial recognition as we'll
see in the following code example using
PCA and say an SVM together you can get
a lot of power but in general even
though it's something that humans do
quite easily
we have brains that are particularly
well optimized for recognizing each
other it's an evolutionary advantage and
computers a priori don't necessarily
have that ability so doing facial
recognition with machine learning while
it's a well understood problem at this
point is something that is maybe a
little bit trickier than you and naively
first guess</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
