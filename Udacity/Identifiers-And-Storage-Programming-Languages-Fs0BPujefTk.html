relationship between identifier or
variable names this means the same thing
and storage places particular values as
we're running our program the state of
the world if I write something like this
in JavaScript it's going to return to
conceptually somewhere there's a box
where we've made enough room to store
the value too and we've labeled that
with X since this is a place for storing
a value we might call it a storage
location or a storage place if I write x
equals 3 we need to go back to this box
and update it with the new value because
X can only have one value at a time in
the same context so if I declare another
variable it's going to make another box
another storage location will need to
use more memory in the computer to store
this value let's see a more complete
example here in this program we start
off by initializing y22 we declare
function my fun of X it prints out X and
then it prints out why and then we call
my fun of y plus 5 a little reasoning
suggests that this is going to print out
well first the value of x x with y + 5 y
is 2 so first we're going to print out
seven and then we're going to print out
y which was 27 and two so initially
maybe our world looks a bit like this
why has the value too but then when we
call this function we're moving into a
slightly new context that has to have
room for X its actual argument and the
particular value we put in there is y
plus 5 or 7 but we want to remember our
roots I defined this function here right
next to the place where Y was equal to 2
so when I'm inside this context printing
out x and y I can get the value of x
right here and I may have to look a
little farther to get the value of y but
I can just trace the arrows and do it so
whenever we make a function call that's
going to get us a new box new storage
locations and I'm going to firm up this
intuition in just a bit I realize it's
very hand wavy now here's the quiz I've
written a Python program that has three
print statements I'd like you to tell me
what each one prints out fill in the
blanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
