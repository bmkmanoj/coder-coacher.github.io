is to go to spotlight and open Xcode
there it is I will click on the create a
new Xcode project link now on the left
hand side here you will notice that
there are two categories I Oh s and OSX
these are two different operating
systems that Apple makes iOS is for
mobile devices and OSX is for desktop
since I'm interested in making a mobile
application I will make sure that
application is selected under iOS all of
the options that you see here like
single view game these are templates
that we can use to create projects you
can think of them as templates that you
see when creating a presentation for
instance single view is the simplest
template around it's a great place to
start for a lot of apps it's also
somewhat similar to a blank template
when you are making a presentation so I
will make sure I select this and hit
next I will name our app pitch perfect
by the way this name will also appear
just below the apps icon on the users
phone I have added a link in the
instructor notes that highlights
recommendations from Apple on how to
choose an effective name for your
application under organization name
Xcode has already entered Udacity you
can enter either your name or the name
of your organization in this box for the
organization identifier Apple recommends
that you reverse the address of your
personal website or the website of your
organization
so here I've added com Udacity now the
reason for us reversing this address is
because we want to make this bundle
identifier unique for our app I am
developing this app in Swift so I will
pick that under devices I will choose
iPhone now the reason why I am picking
this value is because I want to focus my
teaching efforts for this course I could
have made an app for both iPad and
iPhone by the way you can change the
setting later on if you choose I'm going
to hit next and select a folder where I
want to save my project I have
folder called iOS apps on my desktop and
I will hit create and voila we've made
an empty app now there's a lot going on
here in Xcode let's dive into it in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
