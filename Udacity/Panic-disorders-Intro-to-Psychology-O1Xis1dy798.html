panic disorders a panic disorder is
defined by frequent panic attacks and
pervasive and persistent fear worry
embarrassment and concern about having
panic attacks in the future so at the
center of panic disorders is the panic
attack panic attacks involve sudden
changes in body in mind panic attacks
are characterized by an overwhelming
sense of impending doom heart
palpitations trembling sweating
shortness of breath dizziness intense
dread nausea and even a fear of death
these attacks are associated with
perceptions of threat it can occur for a
number of reasons for example fear of
danger inability to escape
fear of embarrassment or fear of a
specific category of objects panic
attacks usually lasts for about ten
minutes but sometimes can come and go
over a period of an hour or more due to
their physiological effects people
undergoing a panic attack may believe
they're having a heart attack or going
crazy as you can imagine this can be
extremely frightening if a person has a
panic disorder there's a preoccupation
of being worried about having a panic
attack
and this puts a person in an anxious
mood which increases the likelihood of
more worrisome thoughts which can
trigger another panic attack to receive
a diagnosis of panic disorder a panic
attack must be followed by at least a
month of persistent worry over future
attacks along with the development of
potentially maladaptive behaviors to
avoid attacks such as avoidance of
putting oneself in an unfamiliar
situation people with this disorder may
tend to disengage themselves from
activities that they once enjoyed for
fear of experiencing panic attacks for
example some people go to the extreme of
avoiding being out in public and that
brings us to our next disorder
agoraphobia agoraphobia is a specific
phobia involving a fear of venturing
into public places now it's not that
people are actually afraid of the public
places but rather they're afraid of
having a panic attack while they're out
in severe cases people are unable to
leave their homes sometime
for years on end about 22% of Americans
have reported having at least one panic
attack but this does not result in
diagnosis of a panic disorder in
addition to having the panic attack a
person also has to experience the dread
and anxiety about having another panic
attack for example I once had a panic
attack it was terrifying and all of
those symptoms felt very real it was
when I was on an airplane one time but I
haven't ever had a panic attack since
that one flight so just because I had
the one panic attack when I was flying
doesn't mean I have a panic disorder and
on top of that it doesn't mean I'm even
scared of flying anymore with all the
diagnostic criteria it turns out that
approximately three point five percent
of people will have a diagnosable panic
disorder sometime in their life and 43
percent of those people who do have a
panic disorder will develop agoraphobia
now let's go to Greg with a little more
about phobias</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
