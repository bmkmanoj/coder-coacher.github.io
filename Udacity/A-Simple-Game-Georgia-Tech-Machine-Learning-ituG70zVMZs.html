concrete example to think about this
let's pretend that we're no longer in a
world of a single agent like we've been
thinking about with reinforcement
learning but we've gone full-blown
generality to two agents okay and let's
call those agents a and B and they're
going to be in a very simple game where
a gets to make a choice and then B gets
to make a choice and then a might be
able to make a choice so this tree that
I've drawn over on the right is going to
capture the dynamics of this specific
game that I'm imagining so these are
little notes here these circles
represent States and we can think about
those in states in the same way that
we've talked about reinforcement
learning in the past the the edges
between these nodes represent actions
that one could take so this should look
familiar this is just basically a game
tree like anyone who's taken a an AI
course might have seen okay I guess so
it doesn't look like a very interesting
game but no I guess it's a sort of
abstract example yes it's a very simple
game just so that we can get a handle on
some basic concepts so in particular if
you look at the details of this game you
start out in state 1 okay and a gets to
make a choice between two actions going
left or going right if a goes right goes
right she ends up in state three if she
goes left she ends up in state two
regardless B gets to make a choice from
state three we can choose to go right
and really that's all that can happen
and this what happens at B goes right
from state 3 is that a value of plus 2
is assigned to a ok all of these numbers
at the bottom at the leaves here are
going to be values or rewards if you
want to think about them that way that
are assigned to player a and in fact for
the purposes of this game it's going to
be the case that B always gets the
opposite of what a gets so if a gets
plus 2 then B gets minus 2 if a gets
plus 4 B gets minus 4 if a gets minus 1
B gets plus 1 that makes sense yeah
though could you write it down so that I
won't forget ok that's fine
so by the way this is a very specific
kind of game here and it has a name
which I want to get right this is a two
player zero-sum finite deterministic
game of perfect information so
as a title or of a description of this
kind of game does this make sense to you
think you know what they all mean
what all those words mean so to players
because it's a and B zero-sum because
the you said the leaves are A's reward
and B's reward is the negation so if you
add the two rewards together you're
always gonna get zero that's almost
right okay
it's not exactly right actually so zero
sum really just means that the the sum
of the rewards is always a constant and
that constant needs to be zero it
doesn't need to be zero
so if it added up to 11 that would still
be zero sum if it add up to 11
everywhere yes okay interesting choice
of terminology finite I don't know
everything seems to be finite here
there's no infinite number of choices or
States or depth deterministic well again
thinking about it in an MDP ish kind of
way there's no stochastic transitions in
this particular picture right so if I'm
in state two and I go right I always end
up in state four period right mm-hmm
game I guess a game is because it's more
than one player sure a perfect
information
it doesn't quite sound like the same
terminology that we used in the MDP
setting but I'm wondering if it's like I
know what state I'm in when I'm making a
decision so it's like a like an MDP as
opposed to a palm DP that's exactly
right it's it's that you know what state
you're in and you yeah that's exactly
what it's like being the MVP versus a
palm to be that's a great analogy school
and does it matter that it's a tree like
this because we when we're looking at
MVPs they we had more complex structures
of graphs and things well you can think
of this as unrolling the MVP if you want
to well there's other than those states
are sort of time stamped and history
stamped yeah for the purposes of this
discussion yes and that's a perfectly
reasonable way of thinking about it okay
but in general we're gonna be thinking
about game trees but actually we're
going through all of this for nothing
because we're gonna discover pretty soon
and none of this matters but give me a
couple of slides to get there okay okay
so this is about the simplest or at
least the the least complicated game
that you can think about a two player
zero-sum finite determinacy game of
perfect information you know basically I
can look at this tree I know everything
I need to know and I can make decisions
about what action I might want to take
in order to maximize my reward okay good
all right now in MDPs of course we had
this notion of policies right you
remember two policy was Michael mapping
from States to actions so in the game
theory world we have something very
similar to policies we call them
strategies so all a strategy is is a
mapping of all of all possible states to
actions so for example here's a strategy
that a might have when in state one go
left and win in state four also go left
that seems like a terrible strategy does
it well just if nothing else just in
state for sure but it's a strategy right
okay
but it's just it's a strategy for one of
the players right exactly
each player has a strategy and that
makes sense right before we talked about
a policy of mapping from States to
action there was only ever one player
only ever one agent and so we didn't
have to worry about what other
strategies there were here when we talk
about a strategy it's always with
respect to one of the players of the
game okay so question I've just given
you one strategy which is what a does in
all the states a could potentially end
up in how many other strategies are
there 4x4 a okay that sounds like a quiz
that does sound like a quiz let's make
it a quiz</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
