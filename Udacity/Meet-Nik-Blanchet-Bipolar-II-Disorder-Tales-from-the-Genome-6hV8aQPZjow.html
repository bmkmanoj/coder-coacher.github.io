years old I currently live in San
Francisco California though I have lived
all over the United States and I am died
have been diagnosed with bipolar two
disorder bipolar two disorder is
characterized by long periods of
depression like symptoms so let G lack
of motivation lack of ambition periods
periods of hopelessness periods of
sadness although not everyone
experiences it in the same way in
addition to that bipolar 2 has fun
little twist where you've also got
periods of what's called hypomania
hypomania is like a less extreme form of
mania mania being where you have a
complete break from reality and you are
hyper energetic hyper optimistic you
usually take a lot of risky behavior for
example sort of the characteristic that
my doctor always tells me to watch out
for is give me a call if you've decided
that you're going to Vegas and going to
buy a yacht for the weekend because it
might seem like a lot of fun so bring me
in on the fun hypomania in my case
manifested as periods of extreme
sociability hyper sexuality extreme
productivity of work and less sleep than
normal
also with bipolar two disorder the
hypomanic periods are rare so one to two
times a year and fairly brief somewhere
between three and seven days which is
very different than standard mania I see
and when were you diagnosed I was
diagnosed bipolar two disorder in
November of 2012
okay so you've only known that for a
little bit of time right and how has
that affected you had a how how did that
come about so I had been diagnosed with
depression for and this is apparently by
the way a very typical story I had been
tagged diagnosed with depression for
about five years I was going to
psychiatrist and a psychologist
regularly and they would prescribe
various antidepressants none of which
would work and in fact my symptoms over
time gradually but but noticeably
trended worse and worse and worse after
I moved to the Bay Area
my psychiatrist that I got out here
pointed out that I might actually not be
responding well to the medication
because it was treating something that I
didn't have and instead he's suggested
that I switched to mood stabilizers
well the confirming fact came after I
was taking a very high dosage of an
antidepressant and through the end of
November and through most of December I
had a very very bad period of depression
I had no motivation to do anything I
stopped going to work it was pretty bad
and then when I went back and in saw him
again he prescribed a what's called a
mood stabilizer which is different than
an antidepressant well that leads me to
another question about sort of
advantages and disadvantages here you've
touched on them briefly but from your
own perspective I mean are there any
advantages to being or having showing
symptoms of bipolar and and and I'm also
curious in the disadvantages so the
advantages have never really thought of
it that way
one thing they don't tell you is that
hypomania is awesome it feels really
good you you're an animal in bed you are
hyper productive at work you have a lot
of energy you are really social you're
really charming you're really dynamic
you can be a little bit more risky with
your behavior but not so much so the
people around you are like scared for
you so people just think pound it's
really on par this weekend you basically
feel like you are king of the world for
a period of time the disadvantages are
obviously work disruption right so
that's the biggest one with me these
long drawn-out periods of silence and
you know as a friend of mine like I
would go through periods where no one
would hear from Nick where is Nick I
would just disappear because keeping up
appearances and and making sure the
people around me are comfortable having
a good time is important to me and so
when I was in a bad place I instead of
like being the negative guy around
everyone all the time I just sort of
removed myself from the situation and of
course there's social stigma stuff
attached with it too which makes it
complicated it makes it difficult to
have relationships it makes it difficult
to stick to tasks
I stopped and started colleges a number
of times and looking back it probably
had a lot to do with this I don't want
to blame this for all of my problems
right I still have good days and bad
days I'm still mortal I still make
mistakes but I suppose now that I think
about it another advantage of bipolar
disorder and having had it diagnosed is
I get insight I know a little bit more
about why things happen why am i this
way why one it gives context it doesn't
excuse things I still have things I need
to work on but it gives little context
about what my struggles might be about
the things that I need to watch out for
it also makes sure that I exercise
because that's very helpful how do other
people perceive you as someone who is
bipolar what's the general reaction how
how is it perceived by others both
strangers just say the general public
but also your friends have they
responded and and what's your reaction
to their reactions when people who I
know and have known for a period of time
find out that I'm bipolar I tend to get
one of two reactions one is generally
supportive and saying oh well I'm glad
you're getting this managed I'm glad
you've got some stuff and the other ones
sort of like a duh I could have told you
that not because it manifested because
but because you know there because they
have noticed these trends that I have
and they knew that there was something
up but they never knew what it was and
so okay this makes sense that you've got
this we're curious in knowing what is
your family history of bipolar and any
other mental health condition that you
think might be related so my mom my mom
was diagnosed with bipolar two disorder
and she's a she was actually on the same
medication that I am on now for a while
but she never told me this my sister one
of my younger sisters suffers from
depression my dad is the actually on
that side of the family he is the most a
DD person I have ever met in my entire
life like you know the Wikipedia hole
where you just click clicking on
hyperlink up to hyperlink up to
hyperlink until you've got a million
tabs open yeah like he can't use
Wikipedia because it's
I say is it his weekend will be gone
what do you think about the portrayal of
mental health in general both in the
media and in society at large how we
deal with it as a population do you
think we take mental health seriously do
you think it's portrayed in a meaningful
way that gets the right kind of
attention or do you think we still have
some work to do I definitely believe
that in the area of portrayal of mental
health well in the area of how the
average person thinks of mental health
we have some work to do because it's one
it's easy to look at someone and say you
have a broken leg you have a scratch
you've been burned but when it permeates
the mind when it permeates the thing
that's sitting behind the eyes and
looking back at you
it's hard to say well you're an asshole
versus you have an issue and because
it's so difficult to recognize in the
first place we tend to overlook it
minimize it and and not give it the type
of treatment that we should if I had to
have a message for somebody who's
bipolar - I would definitely say seek
medical assistance this is something
that responds very well to treatment and
once you've gotten the proper treatment
once you've been able to help yourself
out then you can live a very very
satisfying and happy life</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
