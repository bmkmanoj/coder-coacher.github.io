the importance of the material you're
about to learn using a data structure
that employs a hash function allows you
to do lookups in constant time let that
sink in for a second
with everything you've learned so far
you need to do lookups in linear time in
a list or a set you need to look through
every element to find the one you're
looking for
stacks and queues that you look up the
oldest or newest elements immediately
and priority queues will let you find
the highest priority element quickly but
if you want any other element you've got
to do a linear time search the ability
to do constant time lookup s' will make
almost any algorithm you write instantly
faster everyone here at Udacity was
really excited that you'd be learning
such a crucial topic today they all
wanted to be here to talk about it but
they couldn't all abandon their work so
they decided to send a representative
whoever was the most excited let's see
who they said Starbucks says that this
concept shows up constantly in technical
interviews you can almost always
optimize an answer or improve an answer
with it or reduce a complex question to
just use the hash function also he's all
