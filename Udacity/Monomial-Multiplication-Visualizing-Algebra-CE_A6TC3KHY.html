is the correct answer that's some great
work if you got it correct if you got
stuck somewhere stay with me and then
pause it when you find a mistake and
then keep going this question involved
exponents and a negative term so there
are a couple places where you might have
gotten tripped up I'm going to list this
factor 2 y squared on one side of a
rectangle then I'm going to have 4y and
negative 5y squared on the other side of
my rectangle I'm going to consider this
a positive region because I have a
positive number times a positive number
i shaded this region orange because
we're going to wind up with a positive
number here's a positive times a
positive for this region I've shaded it
gray because we have a negative number
times a positive number will wind up
with a negative area here 2y squared
times positive 4y is 8y cubed next I
have 2y squared times negative 5y
squared I'm finding the area of this
part of my rectangle I know a negative
area might not make sense but you could
think about this area as the area that
you have and this area about the area
that you owe we use our properties of
numbers to multiply to a negative 5 and
our properties of exponents to get
negative 10 y to the fourth finally we
reverse the order of the two terms to
get our final answer negative 10 y to
the fourth should be our first term and
positive 8 y to the third comes second
keep in mind the signs in front of the
term stay with them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
