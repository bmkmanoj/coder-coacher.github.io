I'm going to ask you to write a function
and what I'm going to ask you to do is
to define the function called deal which
will deal out some hands so that we can
actually play some poker
and you should give this deal function
the number of hands that you want dealt
the number of players and we'll
optionally allow you to define the
number of cards in each hand for a
regular poker that'll be five but
there's other games where you deal out
seven or other numbers of cards we want
to allow for that to to make the deal
function a little bit more in general so
your task is to define the function with
that signature that would return a list
of numb hands different poker hands each
one has n cards and I'll give you a hint
that you should look at the Python
module called random and look up to see
if there's something there that can help
you shuffle the cards so what deal we'll
do is take a deck shuffle it and then
deal out those hands and return the
value of those hands</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
