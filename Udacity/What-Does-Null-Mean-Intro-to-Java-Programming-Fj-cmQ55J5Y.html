two object references that pointed to
different objects now we're going to
look at a different situation when
object reference doesn't point anywhere
at all let me explain that over here you
have a situation with which you are very
familiar we have a variable that
references an object here of class cat
now my favorite cat is in fact my cat
Eliza but maybe Sarah doesn't like cats
and her favorite wouldn't be any cat at
all that is in the variable her favorite
there wouldn't be any reference to any
cat object in Java he's you note such a
reference to no object at all with the
keyword null so this variable here holds
the special null reference this variable
here holds the reference to some cat
object generally you would use this
distinction meaning either a reference
to a specific object or a null reference
if the object is optional to test
whether a variable is null or not you
use equal equal and you test is this
reference the null reference now if
there is a chance that a object variable
contains no it actually is important
that you make that test because if you
invoke a method on a null reference then
something bad happens and the method
call blows up well it doesn't really
blow up of course but it does terminate
your program with a null pointer
exception it is simply illegal to call
any method on No don't do it
instead make this test first I've
prepared a little quiz here where I'm
going to ask you about several kinds of
tests so here's the situation our
intrepid reporter went to City Hall to
get a statement from the mayor and now
I'd like you to give me the Java code to
test whether the statement was one of
the following did the mayor say no
comment just type in here what you would
put inside the parentheses of an if
statement to check for that
a couple more did the man say nothing at
all and finally did the reporter not
manage to get a statement maybe he was
stuck in traffic so just type in the
conditions for each one of them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
