told me offline that you did expect what
we're going to do is VT is defined using
the bellman update right the bellman
equation in terms of VT minus one so
what we're going to do is structure
things around that bellman equation so
what I've done here is broken up the
bellman equation kind of kind of a
series of steps VT of B is the max over
actions of something what is that
something that something is the sum over
all observations of something else and
what is that something else that turns
out to be the sum over all states of the
reward function for that state of given
that action times the belief state and
then normalized by the number of
observations plus the discounted
expected value of the next state the
expectation comes over the observation Z
and then the value of the next state is
VT minus one of the state estimation of
be easy all right so this is really just
the bellman equation but I kind of
unrolled it I guess our kind of untell
escopeta so that each of these
operations going to be easier to build
out of vectors okay so that the sum of
the S is just for the thing on the left
side of the plus yes right because it's
just the reward right and what's going
to happen is this side is also going to
have a sum over s in it weighted by B of
s and that's going to allow us to
actually think about this whole thing as
a dot product of the belief state with
some kind of messy vector okay like mrs.
