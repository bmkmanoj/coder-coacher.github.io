computer misbehaving how many times
you've seen orphan windows like what I'm
showing you on the screen why does this
happen
a simple answer this programs are not
being hygienic that is they're not
cleaning up after themselves now you
cannot fault the applications themselves
if an application encounters an error or
if the user decides to kill an
application either ways the system
services that the application was using
have to have a way of gracefully
terminating and getting rid of the state
that is the bread crumbs it created
along the way and it may have strewn
such bread crumbs all over the computer
some may be in data structures and
memory some may be visible like the
orphan windows that I'm showing you on
the screen and so on bottom line is
these breadcrumbs are using a precious
resources in the computer it may be
visible resources like real estate on
your display of failed applications or
invisible resources like memory leaks
network bandwidth that is being chewed
up by connections that are persisting
beyond the life of an application
persistent data structures on the disk
and so on lrvm and rio vista which is
really an implementation of the RVM
semantics on top of a persistent file
cache took a very narrow view of
recoverability namely recovering the
state that need to be persisted across
system crashes either because of
software failure or power failure but
imagine a system service that spans
several machines a network file server
is a good example NFS is supposed to be
stateless which means that the
client-server interaction maintains no
state at the server pertaining to the
clients so what that means is taking
down a file server and bringing up the
file server again does not need
any coordination with the clients that
this file server may be servicing at any
point of time but look at what is
happening from the point of view of the
system especially the client boxes that
are interacting with the file system in
this case there are clients all over the
network so far this file server is
concerned and indirectly NFS server is
leaving breadcrumbs all over the land
because of accesses that a client may
have made with the file server in each
one of these boxes imagine what happens
when a client program that initiated a
file system call quits in the middle of
its exchange with a file server
how will the file server know how to
clean up all the mess and in fact with a
stateless file server it doesn't even
know that there have been breadcrumbs
created on this node the short answer is
the file system cannot know about these
kinds of breadcrumbs that have been
created all over the network and I'm
giving you a file server as one example
but in general all of the system
services that a client program is
reliant on create State and these
partial States may live forever if an
application crashes in the middle worse
yet you as a user may be asked by the
operating system to do some cleanup not
knowing what the cleanup may entail for
you personally am I going to lose two
hours of work that I just completed I
have no idea what will happen when I
click the ok button here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
