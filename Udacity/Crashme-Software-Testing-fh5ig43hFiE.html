we actually test operating systems so
the Linux kernel developers are actually
general this is this tool works for
multiple versions of unix have a tool
called crash me here we have the OS
kernel and here we have this program
called crashing what it does is it
allocates a block of memory writes
totally random garbage to it then it
masks off all signal handlers that is to
say system level exception handlers and
it just jumps into the block of garbage
that is to say it starts executing
completely garbage bites and what
happens when you start executing garbage
bites is often the instructions are
illegal and the operating system kernel
has to handle this so over time what we
end up doing is exploring that is to say
testing a lot of operating system system
calls a lot of calls into the operating
system the contain really weird and
unexpected values and if the colonel
goes ahead and keeps running properly
and keeps trying to kill the crash me
process then the operating system kernel
is succeeding if the colonel ever falls
over if it crashes then we've discovered
a bug we have to go ahead and fix the
operating system and the experience is
is that if you take a real operating
system and you test it with the system
with a tool like crash me you'll end up
crashing the colonel unless the
operating system has already been
hardened with a tool like this and so
we're getting out here is something very
fundamental about testing and working
towards another testing principle the
principle is is that if you have an
interface or an API that represents a
trust boundary that is a boundary
between users between part of the system
that we trust and users on the other
side who we can't trust to stay within
the domain of the API that we're
implementing then we have to test that
API with all possible representative
values not just ones that the developers
happen to think are in the domain so
there's our principle and it turns out
that in practice people are pretty bad
at this that is to say people aren't
empirically very good at testing these
interfaces with a full range of values
and this is sort of this put this lies
at the core of a lot of security
vulnerable that we see in real software
