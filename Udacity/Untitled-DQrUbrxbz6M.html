mapping applications where you saw how
to set up the Google Maps API and
integrate an authenticated map into your
application you saw the map fragment in
a user interface and you saw how to use
that to get a Google map object that you
could then manipulate in code in the
last lesson we modified a lot of
properties of the map and it's often
helpful to think of them as being
properties of a camera floating over the
landscape you could look at it as the
camera is on an aircraft that's flying
over the map so as well as setting
latitude and longitude of the location
you want to look at there's also cool
stuff like setting the direction of the
cameras looking in and the angle at
which it looks at the map the camera
doesn't always have to point straight
down as well as having the ability to
animate the movement of the camera give
the impression of flying over a
landscape in this lesson we'll do a lot
of work with the camera and we'll see
how it can be used to build better maps
for your apps</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
