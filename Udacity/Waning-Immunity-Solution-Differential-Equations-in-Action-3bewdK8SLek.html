our problem concerning waning immunity
first things first the constant waning
time should be defined as 2 times the
infectious time we can show this
mathematically using the equations we
have for the derivatives of s i &amp;amp; R with
respect to time we know that after a
long period of time we want to attain a
steady state situation in which number
of people in each portion of the
population susceptible infected and
recover stays constant since we want to
find out how long people should spend in
the recovered stage we start with the
time derivative of R and set that equal
to 0 since we know that our dot now has
an extra term added to it or actually
subtracted from it showing the number of
people that are leaving the recovered
population and going back to the
infected population we can set these two
terms right here equal to 0 as well just
a note I've used C INF to stand for the
infectious time and cwan to stand for
the waning time now if we just do a bit
of algebra we come out with the answer
that R equals 2 I since we know that we
want the number of recovered people to
be twice the number of affected people
we can plug in this extra information to
the equation above and end up with the
answer that the waiting time is equal to
twice the infectious time this leads us
directly into the next part of the
problem we define our 2's in the same
way that I to our is defined except that
we replace infectious time the waning
time and I step with our step as you can
see right here now moving on to our
recursive relations for each element in
the step plus 1 position we need to take
into account the value of the previous
element and the number of people added
and subtracted from the population
during each time step we know that the
one thing that has changed in this model
from the standard SI our model is that
people are now moving from the recovered
population back to the susceptible
population this is why we've needed to
add in this extra term r2s which we
subtract from our and add to s now let's
run the program and see what we get here
we see we end up with this fancy graph
which has three different series for the
three different parts the population
we're looking at remembering how we set
the initial values for SI and are we
know that the blue line here stands for
the susceptible population the green
line stands
the infected population and the red line
stands for the recovered population and
the maximum time that we're looking at
60 days we can see that the red line is
graphing twice as many people over here
as the Green Line is marking which is
exactly the answer that we wanted to end
up with congratulations on successfully
completing the first problem of unit
three</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
