distribution of daily returns for stocks
and the market look very similar to a
Gaussian this property persists when we
look at weekly monthly and annual
returns as well if they were really
Gaussian we'd say the returns were
normally distributed in many cases in
financial research we assume the returns
are normally distributed but this can be
dangerous because it ignores kurtosis or
the probability in the tails in the
early 2000s investment banks built bonds
based on mortgages they assumed that the
distribution of returns for these
mortgages was normally distributed on
that basis they were able to show that
these bonds had a very low probability
of default but they made two mistakes
first they assumed that the return of
each of these mortgages was independent
and two that this return would be
normally distributed both of these
assumptions proved to be wrong as
massive numbers of homeowners defaulted
on their mortgages it was these defaults
that precipitated the Great Recession of
2008</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
