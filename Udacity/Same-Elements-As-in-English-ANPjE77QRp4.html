precondition for same elements as I
don't think there is one well what would
happen if the length of X was 3 and the
length of why we're 10 it could be the
case that the smaller vector of size 3
say it only contains one two and three
and then the larger vector that's of
size 10 it at least contains those
elements well I guess what I'm asking is
is it meaningful to ask whether things
that have the same length have the same
elements or not they can't they can't
possibly be right I guess all it seems
like you there might be value and
knowing if a larger set contains at
least these elements that are in a
smaller set okay so that that's in fact
the case but that's not same elements as
as far as sword is concerned all right
in other words that might be a useful
function for us to have but it's not the
one that we need for sort mm-hmm okay
and it points out a choice that you have
as a specifier here we could if we were
given a vector of length 3 and a vector
of length 10 say no they they don't have
the same elements and remember by same
elements as we're talking about the same
number of occurrences as or we could
treat it as a precondition okay and say
that the lengths must be the same in
order for us even to apply same elements
as as a function and that's the choice
that we're going to we're going to make
here okay so remember the the vertical
lines used for cardinality or length and
the cardinality of X must be equal to
the cardinality of why now we're talking
here about first-order logic we're not
talking about a programming language so
equals means equal it doesn't mean a
sign to or anything else we don't have
to worry about anything like the C or
Java where we have to use two equal
signs symbols in order to designate
equality so we're just going to say that
the length of x equals length of Y and
that's the precondition for same
elements as
going back to when we first asked the
question to state in in English what it
means for the output to be a sorted
version of the input we said things like
each element in X must be found in why
each element of Y must be found in X and
the number of occurrences the elements
in X must be the same as the number of
occurrence occurrences the elements in
NY and we could take that and we could
go through the stage of writing out each
of those parts in first order logic</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
