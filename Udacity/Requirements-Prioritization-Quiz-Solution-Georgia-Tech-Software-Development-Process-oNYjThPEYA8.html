that we have only two that we can
satisfy for sure it makes sense to first
mark as mandatory the ability to
withdraw cash which is the most typical
use of an ATM machine where therefore
gonna mark this requirement with an M
for mandatory it also makes sense to
mark as mandatory the fact that the ATM
system checks the pin of the car being
used by the customer as that's the
typical level of security that the
customer would expect therefore we gonna
mark as mandatory also the first
requirement here and of course we could
also perform biometric verification but
based on our knowledge of the domain it
seems like that should be an additional
verification rather than the main and
only verification for the system will
therefore market super flows that is at
something that we can postpone until a
later release the second requirement
finally another typical operation that
customers perform at ATM machines is
depositing whereas change in an ATM card
spin is not such a common operation with
therefore will mark as nice to have this
fourth requirement and as superfluous
the last one so at the end of what we
have is that we have two mandatory
requirements which are the two that we
can satisfy for sure one nice to have
the requirement which is the possible
third requirement which we might have
time to satisfy and the other two that
are marked as superfluous as something
that we might do later for example in a
subsequent release and of course there
is something subjective in these answers
but again based on our knowledge on our
understanding of the domain these are
the one that makes most sense for an ATM
system as we know it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
