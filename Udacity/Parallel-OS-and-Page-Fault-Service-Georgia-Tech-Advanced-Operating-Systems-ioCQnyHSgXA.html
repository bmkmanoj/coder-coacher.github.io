system and page fault service the easy
scenario for the parallel operating
system is what I'll call as a
multi-process workload and here what we
are saying is yes you have threads
executing on all the nodes of the
multiprocessor but these threads are
completely independent of one another
think of this as a separate process this
as an independent process maybe you have
a web browser here a word processor here
and so on so they are completely
independent processes and if that is the
case if there's a page fault that is
incurred on on this node simultaneously
a page fault another node they can be
handled completely independently why
because the threads are independent the
page tables are distinct and therefore
you don't have to serialize the page
fault service as I told you the parallel
operating system is going to have a page
fault handler that's available in each
one of these nodes so the work can be
done in parallel so long as there is no
data structure that is shared among
these different units of work that the
operating system has to do and so long
as the page tables are distinct which is
the case in a multiprocessor workload
there is no serialization and life will
be good the hard scenario for a parallel
operating system is a multi-threaded
workload now what we mean by
multi-threaded workload is that you have
a process that has multiple threads so
there is opportunity for exploiting the
concurrency that's available in the
multiprocessor by scheduling these
threads on the different nodes of the
multiprocessor and to make it concrete
what I'm going to show you is two nodes
and one and then two and let's assume
that there are two cores available in
each one of these nodes in that case
what I can do is the operating system
may have chosen to put t1 and t3 on node
n1 and t2 and t4 on node n2 so you have
a multi-threaded workload now executing
on different nodes of the multiprocessor
and there is Hardware concurrency
because there are multiple cores
available so in principle all of these
threads can work in parallel and if they
incur a page fault it is incumbent on
the operating system to see how it can
ensure that there is no serialization of
the work that needs to be done to
service the page
faults so if you want to naively think
about what the parallel operating system
would be doing in this scenario the
address phase is shared and therefore
the page table is shared and since the
threads are executing on different
processors the TL B's will have shared
entries in the process of TL B's because
they are accessing the same address
space so that'll be the scenario now if
you think about it what we would want is
to limit the amount of sharing in the
operating system data structures when
they are executing on different
processors in particular is for this
particular mapping that I've shown you
that t1 and t3 are executing on n1 and
t2 and t4 executing on on and to what we
would want is the operating system data
structures that they have to mess with
t1 and t3 have to mess with should be
distinct from the operating system data
structures that t2 and t4 may have to
mess with and that will ensure that you
can have scalability</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
