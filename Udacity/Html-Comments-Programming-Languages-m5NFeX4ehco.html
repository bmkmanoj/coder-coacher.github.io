HTML style comments to our lexer so that
it gets the behavior that we want well
just as we had to list all of the tokens
we're going to have to list all of these
possibilities for things we could be
doing either we're breaking the input
down into tokens or we're handling
comments these two possible choices are
called lexer States a word I really
don't like because it's super ambiguous
we have states and finite state machines
let's not have states elsewhere this
particular syntax for specifying them is
arbitrary it's just a function of the
library we're using so I'm going to
declare a new state called HTML comment
and that's exclusive if I'm in the
middle of processing an HTML comment I
can't be doing anything else I'm not
going to be finding strings or words so
here's my rule for entering this special
mode for HTML comments if I see the
beginning marker left angle bang hyphen
hyphen then I want to enter this special
HTML comment state and not find words or
strings or numbers or tags but instead
ignore everything when I reach the end
marker for an HTML comment I want to
jump back to the initial mode whatever I
was doing before that time when I could
find L angle / an L angle and our angle
by default that mode is called initial
all in capital letters I'm actually
going to do one other thing all at the
same time when we're in our special HTML
comment mode we won't use any of our
other rules even our super happy new
line rule that's counting the line
number so what I'm going to do is call
this string dot count function to count
the number of new line characters that
occur in the token in the entire comment
and add those to the current line number
this is a little tricky so don't worry
if this doesn't make sense the first
time now we've said what to do when an
HTML comment begins and we've said what
to do when it ends but any other
character we see in this special HTML
comment mode isn't going to match one of
those two rules
anything it doesn't match one of our
rules counts as an error and what I'm
going to say is just skip over that
single character in the input it's part
of the comment I don't even want to see
it this is a lot like writing pass
except that it gathers up all of the
text into one big value so that I can
count the new lines later again this is
a pretty tricky maneuver so now I've
changed my web page so that it says
hello there's an HTML comment with the
word comment in it and then there's the
word all and if I've written all of this
code correctly the first time which
really that does not happen in like what
we gone then we'll get a chance to see
how this plays out there was an error on
line 22 this line number increment and
it's yelling at me let's go back up to
line 22 I'd split these onto two lines
so that it would be easier for you to
see but let's not do that because Python
hates it and now with that one simple
syntax error fixed our web page produces
exactly the two tokens we expect hello
starting at position zero and all 1 2 3
4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18
19 20 21 22 23 all starting at position
23 on line one excellent</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
