confusing subjects in computer science
if you get stuck at any point keep
studying the examples and try to find
some more examples until it sticks for
you the idea here is to create a
function that calls itself here is a
really basic example in pseudocode this
code doesn't do anything interesting but
it shows the main parts of a recursive
function first of all a recursive
function needs to call itself at some
point second a recursive function needs
a base case you can think of a recursive
function kind of like a while loop in
some regards you keep going through some
code again and again and again until you
hit some exit condition in a recursive
function the base case is like the exit
condition it lets you know when you need
to stop without a nice base case like
this you could get stuck in something
called infinite recursion that means
your code keeps calling itself and
executing again and again and again and
again and again but because you never
tell it when to stop it just keeps going
infinitely the third thing a recursive
function needs to do is alter the input
parameter at some point if you aren't
altering the input parameter or giving
yourself some condition for changing
every time you iterate you'll never
really know when to stop and again you
end up in the same bad place with
infinite recursion okay now we're going
to go through an example this is the
code that we're starting with and on
this side I'll write out each major line
that we execute so we're going to start
by calling the function with an input
value of two we'll start with this if
clause since our input value is two and
that's greater than zero we move on to
the else part we start by evaluating
this before we assign anything to the
variable output okay so input minus one
that's just two minus one so we're going
to call this function again but instead
with an input value of one and not two
so this is the really confusing part
your computer knows that you still
haven't finished that initial call with
the input value of 2 you're just jumping
into this part without finishing and
it's temporary memory it'll remember
that however it essentially makes a copy
of all of this initial code and you have
to do it again but this time with an
input value of 1
I put an indent here to signal that we
haven't actually finished this initial
call yet but we're just doing a call
inside of that right now ok so let's do
this again this time the input value is
1 but that's still greater than 0 so we
can skip down to the elf's block the
same thing happens the second time
before we assign anything to output we
have to do this recursive statement this
time the input value is 1 so 1 minus 1
is 0 and we have to call this recursive
block again but with a value of 0
instead of 1 or 2 again I indented to
indicate that we still haven't forgotten
about the fact that we never solved this
and return to anything but we do need to
move on and start executing again all
right let's do this again so this time
we actually have something interesting
here the input value is 0 so we never
get to execute any of this else block
we're just staying up here we return 0
so we see it pop up over here now that
we've actually returned something from
one of our calls we can forget about
this recursive with an input of 0 and go
back to that recursive with an input of
1 that we were looking at a minute ago
all right so we return to having an
input of 1 we evaluated this statement
to 0 as I indicated over here again
remember we called the recursive block
we return 0 so now we say that this
whole thing evaluates to 0 and we can
assign 0 to output great now that call
we did where the input was 1 actually
has a return value here which is 0 so
now we can kind of forget about this
recursive block and move back to that
original call where our impo is 2 okay
so back to the original call
this call which used to be recursive
with an input of one got evaluated to
zero so now we can say zero is equal to
output and again we can return zero and
now even our initial call is done great
so the initial call returns zero
recursion can be really confusing
because you start out with just this one
method but you don't even know how many
times you'll end up calling it when I'm
trying to think through how a recursive
function works I'll often write out a
table or a list of steps like this so I
can keep track of my values every time I
hit the recursive block again I always
used to think of it like my computer was
just going on tangents I started with
this initial function and then I kept
calling something else and doing
something else in doing something else
in doing something else and eventually I
would get back to the thing I was
talking about originally remember your
code is going to go through these lines
of code in order it's never going to
assign this output any number until
you've hit the recursive walk as many
times as you need
remember to be really careful when
you're writing recursive code if your
base case doesn't make sense you could
end up doing infinite recursion
let's say we change this base case just
a little bit all I did was get rid of
the less than or equal to and replaced
it with just equal to now this code is
going to run fine if we give it an input
value of 2 or 1 or 4 or even a million
but if the input value was actually less
than 0 this codes never going to return
if you start out with negative 2 you'll
skip the if block and you'll just keep
subtracting 1 next time your input is
going to be negative 3 then you'll
subtract 1 negative 4 subtract 1
negative 5 and so forth if I use less
than though if my number initially is
negative 2 or negative 50 or negative a
million I'll stop as soon as I hit the
base case remember to think about all
the different input values your
recursive statement could have lastly if
you're really not sure what your
recursive block is doing
you can use print statements wherever
necessary by printing out intermediate
values you'll get a sense of exactly
what your code is doing and exactly
which steps</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
