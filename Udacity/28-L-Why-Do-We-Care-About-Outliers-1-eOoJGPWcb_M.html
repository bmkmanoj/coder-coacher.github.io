about why we even care whether we have
outliers remember that what we're
working through here is not just some
academic exercise but typically we're
analyzing our data to help us answer a
business question may be why certain
behavior is happening or maybe even to
be able to predict what might happen in
the future to do that we want to have
our data as close to reality as possible
and that's where the identification of
outliers comes into play lots of times
data that is unusual or extreme can be
that way for one of two reasons one
incorrect data or two abnormal but
correct data data can be incorrect for
any number of reasons from system issues
too bad data collection methods to just
plain typos when entering data the
critical thing to understand is that
this incorrect data can mess with our
answers to our business questions
whether we're trying to explain why
something happened a certain way or what
might happen in the future abnormal but
correct outliers despite being accurate
data can also impact your analysis and
you may have to make adjustments
accordingly so by identifying those data
values that might be incorrect we have
the means to possibly correct them if
they are wrong or understand the
exceptions that are real actually by the
nature of data we can expect to find
extreme data in almost any data so the
fact that they are outliers doesn't
necessarily mean they're invalid or
incorrect but we should know that
they're there so we can adjust our
analysis appropriately an example of
this would be in our income data that we
just went over say we're trying to
analyze some behavior of our customers
based on their level of income our data
shows that most of our customers make
under a hundred thousand dollars so if
we see in our data that there's a single
customer that makes 1 million dollars we
might want to try to confirm that this
is truly the case or we might not want
to
siddur that customer in our analysis
since it may skew our thinking away from
reality this leads us to the question of
what effect outliers can have on our
analysis</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
