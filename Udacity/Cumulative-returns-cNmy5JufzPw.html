that's important is called cumulative
returns so let's consider S&amp;amp;P 500 again
back in 2012 now in 2012 the SP 500
started the year at a hundred and twenty
five dollars and it ended the year at a
hundred and forty two when you listen to
the news you hear things like for the
year 2012 S&amp;amp;P 500 gained thirteen point
six percent that is cumulative return
you don't hear them say over 2012 S&amp;amp;P
500 went from 125 to 142 so how do you
calculate these cumulative returns it's
really easy here's the equation the
cumulative return for a particular day T
is just today's price divided by the
price at the beginning so price of zero
is over here and the price of any
particular day you know they would be
here and we can calculate the value like
this now the cumulative return for the
whole period is where T is this last day
so let's consider the example we've got
here to calculate the cumulative return
for this whole year it's the price at
the end divided by the price at the
beginning minus 1
turns out 142 / 125 is one point one
three six minus one gives us point one
three six which is equal to thirteen
point six percent so our cumulative
return for the ETF SP y was thirteen
point six percent we can calculate and
chart cumulative returns just like we
did earlier for daily returns except now
the plot is showing us the cumulative
return of course instead of the daily
return
note that the shape of the chart is you
know the same as the price chart is just
now it's normalized and in fact this
equation is exactly our normalization
equation so that is how to calculate and
plot cumulative returns we're not going
to have
Dave show you how to do that you're on
your own there now that you know how to
do daily returns it shouldn't be too
tough okay that's it for this lesson
we'll see you again soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
