security cross-site scripting attacks
DDoS as sequel injection how to deal
with those what those are really kind of
a big question yeah and actually I
wanted to almost spend and I could I
could probably spend an entire lecture
on this but we can talk for a few
minutes about some of the high-level
stuff right now
great ok security this is this is a
really big concept and and and when I
was originally doing the notes for this
class I really wanted to spend a lot of
time talking about a couple of major
vulnerabilities but I was getting the
sense that it would it wouldn't fit in
very well with the level of knowledge
you guys had at the time but I can talk
about a few of the high level things now
that you should get smart about the
first this is XSS or cross-site
scripting this basically is when you
accept data from a user and you and
you're displaying it in your webpage and
you're not escaping it we did talk about
escaping and we could join escaping
let's say you had you take some data
from a user and then you print it you
return it to the user in a text area and
then here it goes the the you know
whatever the user typed in you know
maybe you're editing a blog entry and
this is the old blog entry well if the
code they actually typed in has some
HTML in it in particular if it uses the
script tag which we haven't talked about
at all in this class this is how you
would include some JavaScript they can
actually put code in here that might
fetch all of your cookies using document
dot cookie remember we saw that in unit
4 I think and make a request to another
URL sending your cookie there so if I
viewed this page you know if me Steve
loaded this page that this other content
it could cause the browser to load my
cookies and send it to some other site
that that guy could then look at that
request put his cookies in his browser
and then start browsing the site as me
this is the basis for cross-site
scripting if you escape your HTML you
don't have to worry about it there are
cases however where you don't want to
escape the HTML for example in a blog
you know if you if you trust your users
and you want them to be able to enter
HTML for example if they want to put in
links and that sort of thing then you've
got to think carefully do I trust the
user or do I want to write some fancy
escaping that escape some HTML but like
allows links for example that that's a
big
trade-off on reddit we use a piece of
technology called markdown which is a
kind of a simplified language good for
allowing users to leave comments and
that sort of thing and it's got syntax
for leaving links and images but not
just random HTML
well actually what we did is we allowed
likes an image and then we broke Oh all
other HTML so basically the name of the
game for presenting cross-site scripting
is preventing cross-site scripting is
escaping HTML nothing there's another
class of attacks we haven't talked about
and then I've really come up in this
class which is sequel sequel injection
and what what's happening here this is
very similar across site scripting and
and there's another kind of well let's
talk about sequel injection first so if
you have a piece of sequel you know
select you know star from link you know
where ID equals X already equals percent
s this is why you shouldn't use percent
s in sequel statements and in App Engine
they've been using that colon syntax
which is really nice because they do
this game for you but if you were to
generate some sequel in Python using the
string substitution syntax or you just
put in a you know this ID variable and
maybe this ID comes from the URL or from
the user you know if this is a number
you know this works fine but what if
this were actually a you know if this
were the string you know quotes
semicolon I think you'd say like this
makes a comment I'm forgetting some of
my sequel here but effectively you know
you put in a drop table
it's just like cross-site scripting
where if you allow them put an arbitrary
HTML that can close your old tag you
know through some syntax it's often a
closing quote and a semicolon or - -
basically means comment some combination
of things here allows you to just put an
arbitrary sequel into the database so
generally you want to make sure you're
always using a wrapper around your
sequel so App Engine provides that using
there there's equal there's equal query
object that we've been using in this
class another really popular library I
use all the time in Python is called
sequel alchemy it is spelled like this
maybe sequel alchemy is one of my
favorite libraries it's at in its
simplest use case the way I've always
used it is it's basically got a
procedural language for generating
sequel much like the way App Engine has
that language we can say dot all and dot
filter and that sort of stuff
psycho alchemy provides a very similar
interface it goes one step further and
has what's called an ORM which is an
object relational mapping which
basically converts Python objects into
sequel so you don't have to think about
sequel but I hate using these things
because it disconnects you from the
queries you're alright you the queries
you're running the queries are what
causes your web application often to be
slow and if you don't have direct
control of your queries you're not going
to be able to scale quite as
consistently so anyway let's take
welcome use really nice library you know
just like the sequel injection you could
just as easily have memcache injection
you know if you've got basically if
you're taking input from the user and
you're converting that into like a cache
key well depending on what memcache your
library you're using if it's not
validating the key you know they could
put something in in a URL or something
for example that would finish the
memcache statement and create a new one
and pollute your castra stuff we had a
really clever guy try to do that to us I
read it once fortunately he was a friend
and he told us there's one other huge
class of attacks and this is actually
relatively modern thing it's called CSRF
this one's really fun the general idea
is remember
we've talked about forms forums have an
action attribute that is where you want
to submit the form
now we've always been doing things like
you know slash or not specifying it what
to submit to the current URL but you
could put a full URL in here and this
could just have a completely different
site you know ASCII Chan which
incidentally has this vulnerability in
it or it could be you know forum site
udacity.com which also has this
vulnerability in it and you can so you
could build a web page on your own
domain let's say you're at you know bad
guy calm and you make a hidden form you
know you a CSS to hide it and then you
have some JavaScript that automatically
submits this form what's gonna happen is
a user will load your page their browser
will render this form and then you'll
submit it for them sneakily and this
will submit to some other URL and ASCII
Chan won't be able to detect that the
request is coming from a bad guy com
they'll see that it's coming from this
user's browser with their IP and with
their cookies and and CSRF is basically
then the what's happening here is you
are doing something on behalf of a user
they've got their cookies that basically
identify them you know you're logged in
as spez and so somebody can trick my
browser into making a request to another
site as me they can do things like
submit a form as me or vote up on a
story as me or enter a bunch of bogus
content in the forums as me which is
really frustrating so you can actually
if you're if you're enterprising nothing
can trick me into clicking on a link
that you control you can make me submit
something to ask you chat or you can
make me submit something to the Udacity
forums and if you do that you know will
reward you or something now the way you
prevent against this is on your own site
you have to include basically hashes or
some sort of secret in your own forms so
if I've got a URL you know let's say
it's a new page this is my blog
submitting URL
the handler for this URL needs to look
for a hidden input that only exists on
the form itself it's gonna be hard to
explain this in this in this format so
what I would advise you to do is just
Google for CSRF but you already
understand the concepts required to
implement the solution to this which is
basically hashing and secrets you need
to include some secret that is only
included on a new page and so that would
some guy at bad guy calm submits a form
directly to this URL they don't have the
secret and the secret I would have to
come along with the rest of the data
so CSRF it's a really fun attack you can
find it just about every website online
not read it anymore but there was a time
you know the way I learned about this is
somebody made a link on reddit that when
you clicked it would automatically vote
up on that link for whomever was looking
at the page for whoever who was and also
missed this link the sky rocketed to the
front of our page and was like free
limousines that info or something like
that so we were like hmm you know
something's fishy and that that's what I
learned about this attack so hopefully
you can learn about it and not quite so
public of a fashion but anyway so those
are the major security issues there's a
whole lot to do there maybe you know
maybe we can do like a an extra one off
lecture at some point where we you know
break the Udacity forums but this this
is enough to get you started right now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
