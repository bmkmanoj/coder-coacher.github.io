internet services is referred to as
functionally heterogeneous in these
kinds of architectures different nodes
are designated to perform certain
functions or even to see envelop
particular types of requests for
instance the request may be divided
among the servers based on the request
content such as when the requests are
divided based on the alphabetical order
of the requested file name or for a
service such as eBay servers may be
designated to perform browsing requests
versus and buying or bidding requests
with this design it is still possible to
have all of the data in some distributed
shared file system and accessible to all
of the nodes but if the functions are
somehow designated to be executed only
on some subset of the nodes then it is
possible that not all of the data not
all of the state will be necessary to be
made available across all nodes in the
system so there's some optimization
opportunities there clearly one benefit
of this approach is that every single
node in the system is more specialized
for some of the tasks that it performs
or for some of the state that it needs
to serve and therefore it is more likely
that it will take advantage of some
benefits like caching and locality there
are also some obvious trade-offs the
first one is that the front-end will now
need to be more complex because it will
need to parse sufficient a portion of
the incoming request so as to be able to
figure out which one of the underlying
nodes this particular request should be
passed second the overall management of
these systems becomes more complex when
notes fail or when request rates
increase and we need to add more
machines it is important to know what
kinds of machines to add how to
configure those machines what types of
requests or tasks are those machines
supposed to be designated for also even
if something changes in the workload
pattern and all of a sudden there are
more requests of a certain kind then we
have to reconfigure this we can't just
redirect those access of requests to
some of the other nodes if they're not
key
a bowl of processing those kinds of
actions or serving that kind of data so
that may even be the case if the other
notes are otherwise idling the result of
that is that it is much more easy in
these kinds of environments to end up in
situations in which some of the nodes
are hotspots and then there are long
backlogs of pending requests for those
kinds of nodes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
