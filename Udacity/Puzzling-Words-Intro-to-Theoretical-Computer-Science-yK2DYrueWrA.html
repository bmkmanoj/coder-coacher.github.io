simple little puzzle let's say we have a
list of string pairs so a pair of B and
a a BB and a pair of BBA a BB and so on
and we have some number of these pairs
my question is can we select from these
pairs so that the first strings form the
same string has the second strings and
let me show you an example to let you
know what I mean let's pick these pairs
in the following order the third one the
second one the fourth one the second one
again the third one again and finally
the first one if we do that and we
concatenate the first string in the pair
and concatenate the second strings in
the pair then we get this string and if
you look at these then they are equal
all they get their cut in different
places we take the third one first and
we start with a a a B and a a then we
take the second one BBA here ABB here
and so on this problem whether or not we
can do this with a given set of strings
is called the post correspondence
problem or PCP after the logician animal
post who first post it here's the really
mind-blowing part it turns out that any
computer program can be stated as a PCP
using just seven pairs of strings now
I'd like you to tell me what this means
from the given list of statements does
it mean that PCP is generally
undecidable for seven pairs of strings
or more or does it mean PCP is generally
decidable for six pairs of strings or
less any SAT problem can be transformed
into a PCP using seven strings and
finally no PCP instance with seven pairs
of strings or more is decidable check
whichever statements you feel are true</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
