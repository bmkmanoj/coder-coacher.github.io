level random testers as early as
possible in the development process and
there are a number of reasons for this
first of all what we'd like to do is
start off with a simple version of our
system that doesn't implement very much
functionality and then we want to use
sort of a weak buzzer that is to say I'm
going to test it with values that are
maybe perhaps not that interesting and
the good thing about this combination is
these weak random tests probably are
going to find some flaws but what
they're not going to do is flawed our
developers with huge numbers of bugs
like might happen if we used an
extremely strong random tester the sort
of no easier way to demoralise software
developers then to hand them a really
big pile of bugs nobody wants that but
they're going to start to do is ignore
those bugs and get back to getting work
done what you want to do is give people
a slow but steady stream of important
with important bug reports and let them
fix these as they go on and there's
another reason why it's nice to give
people a continuous stream of bug
reports which is that what these do is
they help show us flaws in our software
they help show us interfaces that we
don't understand they help show us
modules that end up being extremely weak
for one reason or another and they
basically help us better understand
where our software development effort is
going wrong so now if instead of giving
people maybe a couple of bug reports a
week for a year we give them 100 bug
reports at the very end all they're
going to do is triage to find the five
most critical bugs and fix them using
hacks so nobody learns anything
everybody's angry nobody's happy rather
what we like to have done is have been
doing random testing all along and using
it to spot weaknesses in our software
the other thing that happens is as our
software evolves to be more robust as we
move towards releasing it we're evolving
our random tester to be stronger and
stronger that is to say maybe this week
we had a feature where we generate a new
kind of random input that we haven't
generated before and now this is going
to generate some bug reports and we'll
fix them and I software evolves to be
more robust if we keep doing this not
just over weeks but over years what
we'll end up with is a random tester and
a system that have sort of gone through
this coevolution process where they both
become much stronger that is to say
we've evolved an extremely sophisticated
random tester and we've also evolved a
system that gives were robust with
respect to the kind of faults that can
be triggered by that random tester and
so I firmly believe is of course I can't
prove this and you're free to disagree
is it if for example Microsoft had done
this from the beginning Adobe had done
this from the beginning and these other
companies that end up with lots of
security vulnerabilities had fuzz their
products all the way through the
development chain they'd end up with far
fewer of these sort of nasty
crashes and critical security
vulnerabilities that they're always
scrambling to patch and that anybody
with a fuzzer seems to be able to find
without a whole lot of effort or at
least that's been the case in the past
and it's possible now that with more
widespread use of more aggressive
buzzers that kind of era of easy
security bugs in popular products maybe
is hopefully starting to kind of tail
off</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
