founder of charity miles charity miles
is a free app that allows people to earn
money for charity whenever they walk
around her bike I was a finance lawyer
for a number of years and when I was in
law school before that I started running
marathons to raise money for Parkinson's
research in honor of my grandfather who
has Parkinson's and I figured if I got
enough people together then collectively
we would have the clout of a celebrity
and then companies would want to sponsor
us the first technological project that
I worked on was actually while I was
still a lawyer and I thought it would be
really cool if we could make something
where we could crowdsource what we think
the law should be and it totally failed
so but it was a really good experience
if you're gonna create an app or if
you're gonna be an entrepreneur in any
field I think there are many moments of
failure but it's how you spend those
failures into a learning lesson or a
success that I think are the most
important it's like I never would've
thought a charity model if I hadn't had
failures before I got the engineers I
talked to a lot of people just ran the
idea by them just to see what they
thought and then I got the developers
and we worked on wire framing and
designing everything all these features
that you know we had in there crammed in
there we gotta take that out take that
out so we ended up with something that
would just add one thing you just choose
from over 30 world-class organizations
from Wounded Warrior Project to feeding
America the World Wildlife Fund ASPCA
I'm gonna choose the Michael J Fox
foundation for Parkinson's research in
honor of my grandfather and then we're
gonna go for an outdoor walk and now
thanks to Johnson and Johnson were able
to earn money for the Michael J Fox
foundation for every mile that we walk
and this little mile counter down here
shows us how far we have walked and if
we press this we can see more so you can
again see how far we've walked and we
can also see in real time the amount of
money that we've raised for the Michael
J Fox foundation and you know every mile
really does matter so as you continue to
walk you'll be earning more money for to
to cure Parkinson's and if you scroll
down you can get a little bit more
information about Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson and
the other things that they're doing to
support great charities and when you're
done you just press the stop button and
finish and that's it it's very simple
whether you're a social good app or just
an app try to create value for society
try to create an app that makes
people happy that makes people healthy
that improves life somehow you're gonna
have to tell investors about it you're
gonna have to tell your family about it
you're going to tell your friends about
it and if it's not something you love
then it's gonna be really boring I never
get tired of talking about charity malls
because I love it and I feel good about
being able to share this with people so
I think it would be great if the next
generation of entrepreneurs could use
apps to harness the power of crowds to
drive major advances in science the
phone has so much on it from the
accelerometer to the GPS and it's
monitoring all this data about us all
the time and that data is super critical
for Alzheimer's or asthma for heart
disease those being able to use phones
to in apps to crowdsource that type of
scientific research is going to change
the game
I would tell potential developers to do
something that they love it's the thrill
of a lifetime they should do it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
