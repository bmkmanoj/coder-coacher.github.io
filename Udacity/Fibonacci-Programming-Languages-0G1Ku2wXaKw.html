Fibonacci sequence of numbers named
after Phileas bonacci in a previous
computer science class it's a great way
to teach recursion here I've written out
a Python definition for the Fibonacci
sequence to get the nth Fibonacci number
well if n is less than or equal to 2 we
just returned one otherwise we return
the sum of the two previous entries so
we're going to get one one to one and
one is two one and two is three two and
three is five three and five is eight
five and eight is leaven that sort of
thing did I do that correctly let's
imagine no I totally didn't do that
correctly man you can't take me anywhere
mmm basic math don't mind me there we go
this looks a lot better you saw nothing
all right so there's our Fibonacci
sequence and in an incredible surprise
move it actually shows up a lot in
nature for example in the patterns of
seeds in a sunflower or in the world's
in a clamshell or in yellow chamomile
plants or all that good stuff however
Fibonacci involves a huge amount of work
let's go see what goes on when we call
Fibonacci I'm going to abbreviate what
brevi ate it with an F Fibonacci of five
well that's going to be based on
Fibonacci of four and Fibonacci of 34 is
based on 3 and 2 2 is a base case so
we're done 3 is based on two and one
over here three is based on fibonacci of
2 and fibonacci of 1 and if you look
carefully a lot of these get repeated
many times we end up calling fibonacci
of 2 once twice three times i called it
similarly fibonacci of three is called
multiple times we're redoing work we're
computing the value of Fibonacci to and
Fibonacci three over and over again that
is wasted work we want to be lazy and
avoid that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
