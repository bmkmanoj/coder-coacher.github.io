their learning journey our nano degree
programs give them the skills necessary
to contribute to today's tech industry
as well as plenty of experience applying
these through projects let's walk
through what the nano degree student
experience is like to complete an inner
degree program students do a series of
projects all of which are shown in their
Udacity home here they can also see what
deadlines are coming up how much
progress they've made and where they
need to go next students can view
details about each project to find out
what it entails access courses to
prepare for it and submit their work
once it's ready for feedback to learn
the skills they need for projects
students take courses consisting of
short videos created by Udacity's
industry partners and instructors
throughout each lesson students apply
what they learn with quick quizzes and
with exercises where they demonstrate
their coding abilities directly in the
browser projects given the opportunity
to further deepen their learning if
students get stuck or have questions at
any point they have tons of support
right at their fingertips they can chat
directly with other students enrolled in
their nano degree program to get instant
feedback thing opposed questions in our
community forums where both the Udacity
team of coaches and the students peers
have discussions our team of coaches
also offers more intensive personalized
assistance through group and individual
appointments when students have built a
project they submit their work for
evaluation by Udacity code reviewers and
provide line-by-line comments on their
code so they can learn what they did
well and where they can improve most
students receive personalized feedback
on the same day they submit by
successfully completing all of their
projects students earn an
industry-recognized nano degree arming
them with the skills to help their
companies leverage the latest
technologies and offer winning products
and services in the marketplace
