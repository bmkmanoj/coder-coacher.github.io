taking timings when we're taking timings
we're doing measurements and so now
we've changed what we're doing from
having computer science being a
mathematical enterprise to having it be
an experimental enterprise and
experimental science
so we're actually doing science it's as
if we're dealing with a messy world with
some chemicals in a beaker and we're
making measurements of those rather than
trying to do mathematical proofs and one
thing we know about doing experimental
science is that one measurement isn't
going to be good enough and that was
clear when we got a measurement of zero
point zero we know that wasn't right so
we know that there can be errors in
measurement and one way in science that
we deal with that is by repeating the
measurements multiple times and I want
you to tell me why you think some
reasons are that scientists when they do
an experiment they take more than one
measurement is it because we want to
reduce the chance of it some external
event affecting the result because we
want to reduce the natural random
variation or because we want to reduce
errors in the measurement process check
all that apply</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
