element I'm going to show you one way
that takes advantage of a nother
built-in list operation that we haven't
introduced yet but that makes it much
easier to write find element and the
operation is called index the index
method is invoked on a list you pass in
a value and the output of the index is
the position that that value exists in
the list so the built-in index almost
solves find element exactly the way we
want the difference is when we invoke
index on a list that doesn't contain the
value we pass in index doesn't return
negative one what it does is give us an
error so let's look at what happens in
the Python interpreter so I'll define a
variable P and give it the value of the
list 0 1 2 if we invoke index on P
passing in 2 we get as a result 2 which
is the position in P where the value 2
occurs for the second example we'll add
more twos in the list and we see that it
always gives us the first one so the
result returned by P annex is the first
place in the list where that occurs so
now we'll try an element that doesn't
exist in the list and what we see is
instead of getting negative 1 of the
result we get an error that the target
element that we look for doesn't appear
in the list so if you want find element
to have the behavior that's described we
can't quite do it using index directly
there's some other list operations that
might be very helpful though so to
summarize the behavior of the index
method if the value passed in is in the
list it returns the first position where
the value is found this is exactly what
we wanted for find element the problem
is if the value is not found in the list
it produces an error there's another
list operation that will be useful to
allow us to use index to finds and find
element and it's useful for many other
things and that's the in word we've
already seen in being used in the for
loop here we use the same word in but in
this context it means something
different the syntax is to have a value
to the left of the in word followed by
the list the syntax is a bit strange
compared to the other things we've seen
in Python it doesn't look like a
procedure call but it's very natural in
terms of how it corresponds to how we
would
say this in English if we say something
like is-3 in the list we would write
that in Python as 3 in p2 let's see how
that works in the interpreter so now I'm
printing the result of 3 in p3 is not in
the list so it prints out false if I
change this to print the result of 2 in
P we get the value true so to summarize
the behavior of the in operator if the
value is in the list the output is true
otherwise the output is false similarly
we can use not in not in has the
opposite meaning of in if the value is
not in the list the result of value not
in list is true if the value is in the
list then the result of value not in
list is false the value not in list is
exactly equivalent to saying not value
in list the only reason to have the not
in is it's more natural to read it this
way in English than having the not
between the value and the in so now to
check that you understand index and the
in and not in operations I want you to
try to define the find element procedure
again it should have the same exact
behavior as the ones we've defined
before that it should give us the
position of the element we're searching
for if it exists and it should give us
negative 1 if it doesn't exist but this
time instead of using a while loop or a
for loop to define it see if you can
define it using index</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
