building to the foot of the ladder or
the bottom of the ladder is 18 feet
great solving for getting this one right
this one was tough to start we should
begin with a diagram will have a
building and then we'll have a 30 foot
ladder stretching from the ground up to
reach the top or near the top of the
building we need to place the foot of
the ladder this part so that its
distance away from the building is six
feet less than the distance up the
building so if we let this distance DX
we know that this distance must be X
minus 6 now this might look confusing we
see a distance that's longer here than
it is here well my drawings not to scale
just because you draw a diagram it
doesn't mean it needs to be perfect
we're just doing a sketch of the
situation so we can solve our problem so
now that we have expressions for this
side in this side and we have a length
of the hypotenuse we're ready to use the
Pythagorean theorem so we'll square the
legs and then we'll square by hypotenuse
this gives us x squared plus x squared
minus 12x plus 36 equals nine hundred
combining the like terms here we'll get
2x squared minus 12x plus 36 equals nine
hundred then we subtract nine hundred
from both sides to get this equation
each of these terms is even so we can
divide our equation by a factor of two
now we want to factor this quadratic we
find factors of negative 432 that sum to
negative six those two factors are
negative 24 and positive 18 next we set
each factor equal to zero and we solve
for the values of x positive 24 and
negative 18 we know that this distance
needs to be positive so this answer is
out this must mean that the distance
from the bottom of the building to the
top of the ladder is 24 feet and the
distance from the base of the building
to the base of the ladder is 18 feet
great solving if you got all the way to
the end</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
