that we just learned of how to hash
things so we're going to use this in our
cookie to prevent people from cheating
remember we had that example where it
kept the count and we want to use
hashing to verify and that that count is
valid and the algorithm is going to look
something like this so instead of just
saying set cookie visits equal five
which anybody can edit we're going to
add a hash to this so we're going to
send something like this instead set
cookie equals five we're going to add
something on the end of this so we'll
add a comma and then we're going to add
a hash of the value here five so that a
would be cheater can't forge your cookie
without knowing what hashing algorithm
we used so we send this cookie with five
followed by you know our hex string you
know it's ABC one two three you know
it'll be whatever the output of our hash
was when we receive this cookie from the
browser and will receive this five you
know you know followed by our hash what
we're going to do is we're going to
break this apart into two into two
pieces you know this will be like our
value and this will be our hash we're
going to hash this value and checks this
and check to see if it equals this hash
and if it does we know this value hasn't
been tampered with and if it doesn't we
we know the cookies invalid then we can
throw it out
so our codes going to look something
like this we split apart the cookie
value based on this comma into two parts
value an and hash and then we rehash the
value and if it matches the one we sent
we know that our cookie hasn't been
tampered with</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
