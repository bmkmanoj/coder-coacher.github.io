said a little earlier in the lesson
testing means executing the program on a
sample of the input domain that is of
all the possible input data and I really
want to stress that this sample is a
tiny sample of the input domain there
are two important aspects of testing
that I want to mention here the first
one is that testing is a dynamic
technique and what that means is that
the program must be executed in order to
perform testing the second important
point is that testing is an optimistic
approximation and what does it mean to
be optimistic well it means that the
program under test is exercised with a
very small subset of all the possible
inputs as we just said and this is done
under the assumption that the behavior
with any other input is consistent with
the behavior shown for the selected
subset of input data that is why it is
an optimistic approach another concept
that I want to mention explicitly is the
concept of successful tests and I'm
gonna do that using another quote this
one from Goodenough and Gerhardt in
their paper towards the theory of test
data selection and what the court says
is that a test is successful if the
program fails and this might sound
counterintuitive but the point here is
that testing cannot prove the absence of
errors but only reveal their presence if
a set of tests does not produce any
failure we are either in the extremely
unlikely case of a correct program or in
the very likely situation of a bad set
of tests and are not able to reveal
failures of the program and that is why
we say that the test is successful if
you can show that there are problems in
the program</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
