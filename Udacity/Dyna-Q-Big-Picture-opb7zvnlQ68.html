rich Sutton intended to speed up
learning or model convergence for
q-learning remember that queue learning
is model free meaning that it does not
rely on T or R T being our transition
matrix and our being our reward function
it doesn't know it Q learning does not
know T or our Dinah ends up becoming a
blend of model free and model-based
methods here's how it works
so let's first consider plain old Q
learning Dinah is really in addition to
Q learning so let's start with the
regular Q learning and then look at how
we add Dinah into it so we initialize
our Q table and then we begin iterating
we observe s we execute action a and
then we observe our new state s Prime
and our reward R with an update our Q
table with this experience touble and
repeat and we do that over and over and
over again interacting with the world
and our Q table becomes better and
better so when we augment Q learning
with Dyna Q we add three new components
the first is that we add some logic that
enables us to learn models of T and R
then for lack of a better term we
hallucinate an experience so rather than
interacting with the real world like we
do up here with the Q learning part and
this is expensive by the way we
hallucinate these experiences update our
Q table and repeat this many times maybe
hundreds of times
this operation is very cheap compared to
interacting with the real world so we
can leverage the experience we gain here
from an interaction with the real world
but then update our model more
completely before we step out and enter
with the real world again after we've
iterated enough times down here maybe
100 maybe 200 times then we return back
up here and resume our interaction with
the real world the key thing here is
that for each experience with the real
world we have maybe 100 200 updates of
our model here let's look at each of
these components in a little more detail
now so in this part where we update our
model what we really want to do is find
new values for T and R the point where
we update our model includes the
following we want to update T so I'm
calling it t prime for the moment which
represents our transition matrix and we
want to update our reward function now
remember that T is the probability that
if we're in state s and we take action a
will end up in s Prime and R is our
expected reward if we're in state s and
we take action a I'm going to show you
in a moment how we'll update T and R
here's how we hallucinate an experience
first we randomly select an s second we
randomly select an a so our state in
action are chosen totally at random then
we infer our new state s prime by
looking at T and we infer our reward our
immediate reward are by looking at big R
or our table so now we've got s a s
prime and R or a complete experience
tuple and we can update our cue table
using that so the cue table update is
our final step and this is really all
there is to Dyna Q we've added these
three sections and what's missing and
I'll get to in just a moment is how do
we update our model of T and our model
of our</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
