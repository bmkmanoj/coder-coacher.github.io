problems with installing and running
software across different operating
environments you saw the problems are
just installing and running applications
on a single machine now imagine trying
to run and install engine X on multiple
machines across different os's it would
be a nightmare with containers you get
independent self-contained packages that
avoid version conflicts this is part of
the appeal of container images they're
easy to distribute because they carry
all of their dependencies with them know
the point of containers is that we want
isolation from various processes we've
already talked about isolation of the
file system level but there are other
kinds of isolation to for instance
network isolation means that each
instance gets its own IP address their
off free to buy a port 80 which is
engine X default port without us having
to deal with any init scripts or startup
files an important concept to note where
as two separate virtual machines on a
computer run to whole separate os's
multiple containers run in the same
operating system because containers are
logical construct we use within the OS
that's what makes them so lightweight
and easy to startup and shutdown</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
