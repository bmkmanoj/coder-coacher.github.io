say I have my old definition of sequence
of XY and we say return the tuple
consisting of a sequence x and y and now
i want to change that how would i change
it well instead of x and y i think i'm
going to insist that we have at least
one argument so i'm going to say x and
then the rest of the args and i can say
if the length of the rest of the args
equals one then I've got this binary
case and then I can take sequence of X
the second argh is now no longer called
why it's called args at zero else now
I've got a recursive case with more than
two hours and I can do something there
so it's not that hard but I had to do a
lot of violence to this definition of
sequence and come to think of it I may
be repeating myself because I had to do
this for sequence and I'm also going to
have to do it for alt and if I expand my
program let's say I start wanting to
take on arithmetic as well as regular
expressions then I may have functions
for addition and multiplication and
others and I can have to make exactly
the same changes to all these binary
functions so that seems to violate that
you don't repeat yourself principle I'm
making the same changes over and over
again it's more work for me there's a
possibility of introducing bugs is there
a better way so let's back up and say
what are we doing in general well we're
taking a binary function f f of X Y and
we want to transform that somehow into
an NA a function f prime which takes X
and any number of arguments the question
is can we come up with a way to do that
to automatically change one function or
modify or generate a new function from
the definition of that original function</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
