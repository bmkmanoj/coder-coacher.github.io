quantity negative 5 squared we have
negative 5 twice and negative 5 times
negative 5 is positive 25 for the second
problem we have the negative of a to the
0 remember when I have a negative sign
out in front it's a negative 1 so
negative 1 times 8 to the 0 any number
raised to the 0 power is just 1 so we
have negative 1 times 1 negative 1 is
our answer number three is pretty tricky
we have one to the hundred it might be
tempting to write 100 as the answer but
we really know that this is 1 times 1
times 1 100 times this is a lot of ones
but we know when we multiply all these
ones together we'll just wind up with
one for number four we have the negative
of 5 squared minus 2 squared this
negative sign out in front is really
negative 1 times 5 squared so I'm only
needing the square the five I don't
square the negative one this is a big
difference between number one and number
four and number one we have the quantity
negative 5 squared here we only have the
negative of 5 squared so we just square
the five 5 squared is 25 times negative
1 is negative 25 then I have a minus 4
on the n 2 squared is 4 negative 25-4
well i have negative 25 and negative 4
so that's more negatives i have negative
29 and finally for number five we have
the quantity negative 4 plus 7 squared
remember we can't distribute the square
over the sum we need to add these
numbers together first then do the
square negative 4 and 7 make 3 and 3
squared is simply not if you've got at
least half of these right excellent work
some of these were a little bit tricky
so it's okay if you didn't get all of
them right but I'm sure you will next
