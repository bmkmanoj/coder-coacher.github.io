really coming along we've broken it out
into its own library that way we can
reuse it across projects let's check out
how this project works inside our
Android app Bill directory we have this
Java jokes directory that contains a
stock Gradle Java project just like
we've been building all along if we use
the terminal to navigate to the Java
jokes directory we can use Gradle to
build this project on its own without
reference to the Android app however our
app doesn't yet know anything about this
library what we need to do is declare a
compiled dependency on the output of
this library project to do that we need
to add the library project to the same
multi project build as our Android app
we can do that and the settings dot
Gradle file of the root project the
settings dot Gradle file is where we
tell Gradle what sub projects to include
in the multi project build we already
have the app project for the Android app
so we'll add the Java jokes project
there we go
now if we ask Gradle what projects are
sub projects in this multi project
build.gradle tells us that there are two
sub projects the Android app and the
Java library next we need to declare a
project dependency between our Android
app and our Java library we can do that
in the build-out Gradle file in the app
directory here we simply say that our
app has a compile time dependency on the
project Java jokes now that we've gone
ahead and declared that dependency we
can go ahead and import our Java library
into our Android project and we can use
the class from our Java library if we
bust out the old test device here's the
joke from our Java library inside our
Android app when you run this multi
project build if you watch the Gradle
console you'll notice something like
this the app project started running
some tasks then the Java jokes project
had jumped in to create a jar for the
app project to use well that's all there
is to it to add a Java library project
to an Android studio build</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
